            <h2>Soluciones exactas para la interacción de materiales de Dirac anisótropos con campos eléctricos y magnéticos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julio Armando Mojica Zárate</p>
            <p>This work analyzes anisotropic Dirac materials, such as graphene and borophene, under inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields with position-dependent profiles. Exact solutions of the Dirac--Weyl equation are obtained for singular and exponentially decaying interactions, showing how anisotropy and field shape influence the energy spectrum, Landau levels, and state localization. The analysis is further extended using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) in its perturbative form, applied to systems with bounded domains $( -\infty, x_0 ]$ or $( 0, x_0 ]$. In particular, we consider the case $( -\infty, x_0 ]$, where the field vanishes asymptotically. The first-order corrections reveal how the finite range $x_0$ modifies localization and transport, and how a critical electric field emerges at which Landau levels collapse, providing insight into the design of field-defined regions in two-dimensional nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Single-Atom Photocatalysts on TiO2 : Insights from X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingying Li, David Morris, Peng Zhang</p>
            <p>Surface modification of TiO2 with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective strategy for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Cavity Control of the Interlayer Exciton Energy Spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Sanchez-Lopez, Ze-Xun Lin, Di Luo, Prineha narang</p>
            <p>Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</p>

            <p>Tunable superconductors provide a versatile platform for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate controllable superconductivity in suspended NbSe2 thin layers, achieved through local strain and thermal modulation of the superconducting state. Our results show that suspended NbSe2 structures enable strain modulation of the critical temperature by up to approximately 0.92 K (about 12.5% of the critical temperature) and allow the realization of gate-tunable superconducting critical currents. We further demonstrate configurable hysteretic transport characteristics exhibiting multistability and negative differential resistance, providing easily reconfigurable, spatially dependent superconducting states. These phenomena are well explained by calculations of electron-phonon coupling using density functional theory, together with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau dynamics coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. Our work provides profound insight into strain and thermal modulation of van der Waals superconductors and opens new opportunities for tunable on-chip superconductor devices, integrated superconducting circuits, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Magneto-Optical Study of Chiral Magnetic Modes in NiI$_{2}$: Direct Evidence for Kitaev Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartik Panda, Chaebin Kim, Daniel Bazyliansky, Javier Taboada-Gutiérrez, Florian Le Mardelé, Jan Dzian, Guy Levy, Jae Ha Kim, Youjin Lee, Bumchan Park, Martin Mourigal, Jae Hoon Kim, Alexey B. Kuzmenko, Milan Orlita, Je-Geun Park, Nimrod Bachar</p>
            <p>Bond-dependent magnetic interactions, particularly those described by the Kitaev model, have emerged as a key pathway toward realizing unconventional magnetic states such as quantum spin liquids and topologically nontrivial excitations, including skyrmions. These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.</p>

            <h2>KTaO3-based editable superconducting diode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yishuai Wang, Wenze Pan, Meng Zhang, Yanwu Xie</p>
            <p>Superconducting diodes, which enable dissipationless supercurrent flow in one direction while blocking it in the reverse direction, are emerging as pivotal components for superconducting electronics. The development of editable superconducting diodes could unlock transformative applications, including dynamically reconfigurable quantum circuits that adapt to operational requirements. Here, we report the first observation of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, a two-dimensional oxide interface superconductor with exceptional tunability. We observe a strong SDE in Hall-bar (or strip-shaped) devices under perpendicular magnetic fields (< 15 Oe), with efficiencies above 40% and rectification signals exceeding 10 mV. Through conductive atomic force microscope lithography, we demonstrate reversible nanoscale editing of the SDE's polarity and efficiency by locally modifying the superconducting channel edges. This approach enables multiple nonvolatile configurations within a single device, realizing an editable superconducting diode. Our work establishes LAO/KTO as a platform for vortex-based nonreciprocal transport and provides a pathway toward designer quantum circuits with on-demand functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Polarization - Magnetization Coupling in Visible Light Ferroelectric Double Perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sathiyamoorthy Buvaneswaran, Trilochan Sahoo, Saurabh Ghosh</p>
            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), arising from broken inversion symmetry in ferroelectrics, offers a distinct pathway toward high-efficiency next-generation photovoltaics. We propose and investigate A/A$^\prime$-ordered double perovskites KLaFeMoO$_6$ and NaLaFeMoO$_6$ as promising single-phase ferroelectric photovoltaic (FE-PV) materials. First-principles calculations reveal robust P2$_1$ symmetry with A-site layer and B-site rock-salt ordering, accompanied by hybrid improper ferroelectricity driven by $a^{-}a^{-}c^{+}$ octahedral tilts. Both compounds exhibit significant spontaneous polarization and indirect band gaps of $\sim$ 1.8 eV, well suited for visible-light absorption ($>$10$^5$ cm$^{-1}$). Low carrier effective masses along the polar axis indicate efficient charge transport. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) show that polarization-coupled magnetization switching is feasible above room temperature, making these materials suitable for room-temperature applications.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Enhancement of Yield Strength due to Static Friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryudo Suzuki, Takashi Matsushima, Tetsuo Yamaguchi, Marie Tani, Shin-ichi Sasa</p>
            <p>Friction is fundamental to mechanical stability across scales, from geological faults and architectural structures to granular materials and animal feet. We study the mechanical stability of a minimal friction-stabilized structure composed of three cylindrical particles arranged in a triangular stack on a floor under gravity. We analyze the yield force, defined as the threshold compressive force applied quasi-statically from above at which the structure collapses due to sliding at the floor contact. Using singular perturbation analysis, we derive an expression which quantitatively predicts the yield force as a function of the static friction coefficient and a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing elastic deformation.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Approach to Predict the Curie Temperature of Fe- and Pt-Based Alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Svitlana Ponomarova, Oleksandr Ponomarov, Yurii Koval</p>
            <p>Various techniques can be employed to determine the temperature of magnetic transformation, whether it be the Curie or Neel temperature. The standard procedure typically involves creating alloys with defined compositions and performing measurements experimentally. Alternatively, these temperatures can be predicted based on a material known physical and chemical properties prior to experiments. We identified an optimal feature set and selected the most effective algorithm. Our findings show that the Voting Ensemble model, when combined with Monte Carlo cross-validation, achieves the highest prediction accuracy. The normalized root mean squared error serves as the primary performance metric. For implementation, we utilize the Azure Machine Learning framework for its robust computational and integration capabilities. This approach offers an efficient and reliable strategy for designing and predicting the Curie temperature of ternary alloys. The paper also highlights potential applications of the model and its extensions for other systems.</p>

            <h2>Tunable phononic transparency and opacity with isotopic defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhun-Yong Ong</p>
            <p>In an isotopically disordered harmonic chain, phonon transmission attenuates exponentially with distance because of multiple scattering by the isotopic defects. We propose a simple method, which is based on the static structure factor, for arranging the isotopic defects to suppress or enhance phonon scattering within a targeted frequency window, resulting in maximization or minimization of phonon transmission. The phononic transparency and opacity effects are demonstrated numerically from the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient. We briefly discuss how the underlying concept can be extended to the design of aperiodic superlattices to improve or block phononic transmission.</p>

            <h2>Mobility of Lactose in Milk Powders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Afrough, Pernille Andersen, Tanja Ninette Angelika Weihrauch, Dennis Wilkens Juhl, Serafim Bakalis, Kirsten Gade Malmos, Thomas Vosegaard</p>
            <p>Lactose is the major component of milk powders and is normally found to be in a glassy/amorphous state. During storage, lactose is known to participate in physicochemical processes, including crystallization on the surface and reaction with proteins such as $\beta$-lactoglobulin. Lactose needs to be mobile to participate in such processes. However, there is a lack of evidence of its mobility in milk powders. In this study, we demonstrate that some of the lactose becomes mobile when milk powders are exposed to humid air $-$ an inappropriate storage condition. This mobility is evidenced by peaks in magic angle spinning $^{1}\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectra of milk powders in the range of 3.5 ppm to 4.0 ppm, which stem from lactose molecules displaying considerable rotational mobility. These signals have a longitudinal relaxation time constant T1 similar to that of mobile water according to 2D T1$-\delta(^{1}\mathrm{H})$ experiments under magic angle spinning. Furthermore, 2D $^{1}\mathrm{H}-^{13}\mathrm{C}$ HSQC magic angle spinning experiments of skim milk powder demonstrate the same fingerprint as that of lactose in the solution, confirming our observations.</p>

            <h2>Physical properties and first-principles calculations of an altermagnet candidate Cs$_{1-δ}$V$_2$Te$_2$O</h2>

            <p>We report the crystal growth, structure, physical properties, and first-principles calculations of a vanadium-based oxytelluride Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O. The material possesses two-dimensional V$_2$O square nets sandwiched by tellurium layers, with local crystallographic symmetry satisfying the spin symmetry for a $d$-wave altermagnet. An antiferromagnetic transition at 293 K is unambiguously evidenced from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. In addition, a secondary transition at $\sim$70 K is also observed, possibly associated with a Lifshitz transition. The first-principles calculations indicate robust Néel-type collinear antiferromagnetism in the V$_2$O plane. Consequently, spin splittings show up in momentum space, in relation with the real-space mirror/rotation symmetry. Interestingly, the V-$d_{yz}/d_{xz}$ electrons, which primarily contribute the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface, turns out to be fully orbital- and spin-polarized, akin to the case of a half metal. Our work lays a solid foundation on the potential applications utilizing altermagnetic properties in vanadium-based oxychalcogenides.</p>

            <h2>Density-dependent sodium-storage mechanisms in hard carbon materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Front, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Miguel A. Caro</p>
            <p>Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remains poorly understood. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal that increasing carbon density reduces pore size and accessibility, thereby modulating the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity ($\approx 400$ mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.</p>

            <p>Magnetic interactions between localized spins-1/2 play a central role in quantum magnetism, spin-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation. The range and strength of these interactions are key figures of merit. Here, we probe exchange interactions in pairs and trimers of spins-1/2 introduced by chemisorption of individual hydrogen atoms on graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I.M. Moiseenko, E. Titova, M. Kashchenko, D. Svintsov</p>
            <p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yazeed Tawalbeh, Marwa Ghazi, Mauro Fernandes Pereira</p>
            <p>We present an analytical framework that predicts and controls nanoparticle size through external magnetic fields, uniting first-principles thermodynamics with a sphere packing approach. Calibrated to diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (20 nm at zero field and 5 nm at 250 mT), the model yields a closed-form relation between radius and field that reproduces the observed shift in most-probable size. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kajal Madaan, Guido Roma, Jasurbek Gulomov, Pascal Pochet, Catherine Corbel, Ilja Makkonen</p>
            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</p>

            <h2>High-resolution magnetostriction measurements of the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr2RuO4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunichiro Kittaka, Yohei Kono, Toshiro Sakakibara, Naoki Kikugawa, Shinya Uji, Dmitry A. Sokolov, Kazushige Machida</p>
            <p>We performed high-resolution magnetostriction measurements on the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using high-quality single crystals. A first-order superconducting transition, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis, was observed under in-plane magnetic fields, where the relative length change of the sample, $\Delta L/L$, was on the order of $10^{-8}$. To ensure the reliability of the measurements, particular attention was paid to minimizing the influence of magnetic torque, which can significantly affect data under in-plane field configurations, via field-angle-resolved magnetostriction. Within the hysteresis regime, slightly below the Pauli-limited upper critical field, a hump-like anomaly in the magnetostriction coefficient was identified. Furthermore, a characteristic double-peak structure in the field-angle derivative of the magnetostriction provides additional support for this anomaly. Although these findings may reflect a lattice response associated with the emergence of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the possibility of a broadened first-order transition cannot be excluded. Notably, this magnetostriction anomaly qualitatively deviates from the FFLO phase boundary suggested by previous NMR measurements, highlighting the necessity for further experimental and theoretical investigations to elucidate the nature of the FFLO state in this material.</p>

            <h2>Coupling of Lipid Phase Behavior and Protein Oligomerization in a Lattice Model of Raft Membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhadip Basu, Oded Farago</p>
            <p>Membrane proteins often form dimers and higher-order oligomers whose stability and spatial organization depend sensitively on their lipid environment. To investigate the physical principles underlying this coupling, we employ a lattice Monte Carlo model of ternary lipid mixtures that exhibit liquid-disordered ($L_d$) and liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase coexistence. In this framework, proteins are represented as small membrane inclusions with tunable nearest neighbor interactions with both lipids and other proteins, allowing us to examine how protein-lipid affinity competes with protein-protein interactions and lipid-lipid demixing. We find that the balance of these interactions controls whether proteins remain dispersed, assemble into small oligomers, or form large stable clusters within $L_o$ domains, and that increasing the protein concentration further promotes coarsening of the ordered phase. To incorporate ligand-regulated activation, we extend the model to a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme in which proteins stochastically switch between inactive and active states with distinct affinities. The inverse switching rate, relative to the time required for a protein to diffuse across the characteristic size of the $L_o$ domains, governs the aggregation behavior. Rapid switching yields only transient small oligomers, slow switching reproduces the static limit with persistent large clusters, and intermediate rates produce broad cluster-size distributions. These results highlight the interplay between lipid phase organization, protein-lipid affinity, and activation dynamics in regulating membrane protein oligomerization, a coupling that is central to signal transduction and membrane organization in living cells.</p>

            <p>In this study, we demonstrate an improved version of the roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation method, incorporating a controlled sliding motion into the exfoliation process to achieve uniform nanosheet films of two-dimensional materials at wafer-scale. This scalable technique enables the fabrication of high-quality films suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications. We validate the process by fabricating WSe2 phototransistors directly on the exfoliated films, achieving performance metrics comparable to the best reported devices based on electrochemically exfoliated material. The all-dry transfer method employed ensures minimal contamination and preserves the intrinsic properties of the material. This work highlights the potential of high-throughput mechanical exfoliation as a cost-effective and reliable route for large-scale production of 2D material-based devices.</p>

            <p>Synchronization resulting in unified collective behavior of the individual elements of a system that are weakly coupled to each other has long fascinated scientists. Examples range from the periodic oscillation of coupled pendulum clocks to the rhythmic behavior in biological systems. Here we demonstrate this effect in a solid-state platform: spatially remote, auto-oscillating electron-nuclear spin systems in a semiconductor. When two such oscillators separated by up to 40 ${\mu}$m are optically pumped, their individually different frequencies lock to a common value, revealing long-range coherent coupling. For larger separations, the synchronization breaks. The interaction distance matches the electron spin diffusion length, identifying spin transport as the coupling-mediating mechanism and establishing phase coherence over mesoscopic distances. As a consequence, a wide-area optical pump drives all oscillators within the illuminated spot into a single synchronized state, despite their inhomogeneity. This synchronization accounts for the exceptional stability of the resulting auto-oscillations, enabling collective motion in distributed spin systems and paving the way toward coherent spin networks in spintronics.</p>

            <p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) form cholesteric architectures that can have color specific reflectivity and enable sustainable photonic films. However, achieving uniform color, suppressing iridescence, and accessing ordered defect structures such as focal conic domains remain challenging. Here, we control the photonic properties of CNC films by steering the self assembly process. Across 24 dish-cast films with varying salt concentrations and sonication doses, we combine viscosity measurements, timelapse polarized optical microscopy, and angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy to correlate evaporation dynamics with photonic structure. We show that viscosity, jointly controlled by NaCl-mediated electrostatic screening and sonication-induced bundle fragmentation, dictates the extent of tactoid coalescence. Low-viscosity suspensions generate large, homogeneous cholesteric domains and narrow spectral responses, while high viscosity leads to arrested, heterogenous domains and increased diffuse light reflection. Critically, within a narrow parameter window of intermediate ionic strength and moderate sonication, we reproducibly engineer photonically active focal conic domains. These results identify viscosity-driven flow as a key, previously underappreciated factor in CNC self-assembly and establish design rules for producing structurally colored films with tunable photonic response, reduced iridescence, and controllable defect architectures.</p>

            <h2>The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland</p>
            <p>Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic origin of period-four stripe charge-density-wave in kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuma Murata, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.</p>

            <p>Comprehensive study using DC transport, specific heat, magnetization, and two-coil mutual inductance measurements unveils an understanding of three temperature regimes in SmB$_6$: (i) $T \geq T^{*}$ ($\sim66$K), (ii) $T_g$ ($\sim40$ K) $\leq T < T^{*}$, and (iii) $T < T_g$. Onset of Kondo breakdown below $T^{*}$ releases disorder-driven magnetic fluctuations, which splits the bulk ($\sim116$K) and surface Kondo temperature ($T_k^{s} \approx 7$ K). Below $T_g$, as magnetic fluctuations subside, surface Kondo screening revives, stabilizing the topological surface state and generating an in-gap feature ($\sim2.2$ meV) across which Dirac-like carriers are excited. Nyquist impedance analysis reveals a crossover from purely capacitive to capacitive-inductive behavior, signalling a disorder-driven two-fluid phase of heavy quasiparticles and light, high-mobility carriers below $T_g$. We identify a characteristic length scale, $L_{\nu_0}(T)$, associated with the high-mobility phase, exhibiting an almost divergent trend below $T_k^{s}$. These findings underscore the complex nature of the surface conducting state in SmB$_6$.</p>

            <h2>Why Extensile and Contractile Tissues Could be Hard to Tell Apart</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Rozman, Sumesh P. Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans</p>
            <p>Active nematic models explain the topological defects and flow patterns observed in epithelial tissues, but the nature of active stress-whether it is extensile or contractile, a key parameter of the theory-is not well established experimentally. Individual cells are contractile, yet tissue-level behavior often resembles extensile nematics. To address this discrepancy, we use a continuum theory with two-tensor order parameters that distinguishes cell shape from active stress. We show that correlating cell shape and flow, whether in coherent flows in channels, near topological defects, or at rigid boundaries, cannot unambiguously determine the type of active stress. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous measurements of stress and cell shape are essential to fully interpret experiments investigating the nature of the physical forces acting within epithelial cell layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Gusain, Mohd Zeeshan, B. K. Mani</p>
            <p>Slack's phonon-glass and electron-crystal concept has been the guiding paradigm for designing new thermoelectric materials. Zintl phases, in principle, have been shown as great contenders of the concept and thereby good thermoelectric candidates. With this as motivation, we design new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) using state-of-the-art computational methods. Herein, we use first-principles simulations to provide key theoretical insights to thermal and electrical transport properties. Some of the key findings of our work feature remarkably low lattice thermal conductivities ($<$~1~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$), putting proposed materials among the well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe and other contemporary Zintl phases. We ascribe such low values to antibonding states induced weak bonding in the lattice and intrinsically weak phonon transport, resulting in low phonon velocities, short lifetimes, and considerable anharmonic scattering phase spaces. Besides, our results on electronic structure and transport properties reveal tremendous performance of SrBaGe ($ZT\sim$ 2.0 at 700~K), highlighting the relevance among state-of-the-art materials such as SnSe. Further, the similar performances for both $p$- and $n$-type dopings render these materials attractive from device fabrication perspective. We believe that our study would invite experimental investigations for realizing the true thermoelectric potential of SrBaX series.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Eckert, Daniel de las Heras, Enrique Velasco, Yuri Martínez-Ratón</p>
            <p>We analyze the sedimentation behavior of a polydisperse two-dimensional liquid-crystal fluid using a local density functional theory based on scaled particle theory. Polydispersity is incorporated through variations in the roundness of hard rectangular particles interacting solely via excluded area effects. Despite its simplicity, the model displays a rich phenomenology. In bulk, the fluid exhibits isotropic, nematic, and tetratic phases. In sedimentation, we obtain complex phase stacking diagrams featuring multiphasic stacking sequences with up to four stacks of different bulk phases, inverted stacking sequences such as top isotropic and bottom nematic together with top nematic and bottom isotopic, as well as stacking sequences with reentrant stacks such as tetratic and nematic stacks floating between two isotropic stacks. This phenomenology arises as a result of an intricate coupling between particle polydispersity and the effect of gravity. Our approach can be easily adapted to investigate the sedimentation behaviour of other polydisperse colloidal systems.</p>

            <p>Dipoles in triangular optical ladders constitute a flexible platform for the study of the interplay between geometric frustration and long-range anisotropic interactions, and in particular for the observation of the spontaneous onset of chirality. Frustration magnifies the effect of the dipolar interactions in itinerant polarized dipolar bosons. As a result, the dipole-induced transition between a chiral superfluid and a non-chiral two-component superfluid may be observed for current state-of-the-art temperatures even for the weak inter-site interaction characterizing magnetic atoms in standard optical lattices. On the other hand, pinned spin-$1/2$ dipoles, which we discuss in the context of polar molecules in two rotational states, realize frustrated dipolar XXZ spin models. By controlling the external electric field strength and orientation, these systems can explore a rich ground-state landscape including chiral and nematic phases, as well as intriguing chiral dynamics.</p>

            <p>The intermediate valence of Ce in CeCo$_5$ challenges standard density functional theory (DFT) and static DFT+$U$ approaches, which fail to capture its magnetic properties. By combining DFT+$U$ with exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model for the Ce 4$f$ shell, we find a substantial reduction of Ce spin and orbital moments, consistent with DFT+DMFT, arising from Ce$^{4+}$ - Ce$^{3+}$ valence fluctuations. The total magnetic moment of 6.70 $\mu_B$ agrees with experiment, and the calculated $4f$ density of states reproduces photoemission and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 4.8 meV/f.u. when Coulomb correlations on both Ce 4$f$ and Co 3$d$ shells are included, in very good agreement with experimental data. These results highlight the importance of dynamical correlations and provide guidance for exploring high-performance, low-rare-earth-content permanent magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaki Gen, Takuya Nomoto, Hiraku Saito, Taro Nakajima, Yusuke Tokunaga, Rina Takagi, Shinichiro Seki, Taka-hisa Arima</p>
            <p>We investigate uniaxial-stress effects on the magnetic phase diagram of the square-lattice itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$, where strong coupling among spin, lattice, and charge produces a variety of helimagnetic phases, including rhombic and square skyrmion lattices. Combining resistivity and magnetization measurements with neutron scattering, we find that compressive stresses of only several tens of MPa along [010] enhance antiferromagnetic character and shorten the magnetic modulation period in the lowest-temperature single-Q spiral state, thereby driving the critical temperatures and fields of multiple phases to higher values. First-principles calculations show that increasing orthorhombic lattice distortion deforms the Fermi surface relevant to the magnetism, providing compelling evidence that Fermi-surface nesting plays a crucial role in stabilizing the helical magnetic modulations in EuAl$_{4}$.</p>

            <p>Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Humaira Zafar, Mauro Fernandes Pereira</p>
            <p>This paper delivers the first report of a mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide array design that employs complementary and asym- metric tapered Euler-shaped bends. These provide greater fabrication flexibility to achieve subwavelength-pitch integration while reducing crosstalk to below 30 dB across the 3.1 to 3.6 micron wavelength range. Unlike previous designs, which main- tained constant waveguide widths, the Euler waveguide bends are characterized by asymmetric and complementary tapered waveguide widths. This approach significantly reduces crosstalk to below 30 dB for both the first and second neighboring waveguides across a 500 nm wavelength range, enhancing the efficiency of optical phased arrays (OPA) with a large field of view, optimizing light propagation and minimizing crosstalk. The waveguide array is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2-micron buried oxide layer and a 500 nm-thick silicon layer. The design is highly tolerant to fabrication variations, maintaining consistent performance even with width variations. The spectral responses, simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain method, demonstrate negligible coupling and low insertion loss across the wavelength range. This work offers a robust and CMOS-compatible solution for MIR integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.</p>

            <p>Atomically thin silver (Ag) films offer unique opportunities in plasmonic, quantum optics, and energy harvesting, yet conventional growth methods struggle to achieve structural control at the monolayer limit. Here, we demonstrate phase-selective synthesis of large-area, crystalline 2D Ag films via defect-engineered confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) at the epitaxial graphene/silicon carbide (EG/SiC) interface. By tuning graphene growth and post-growth defect introduction, two distinct Ag phases are achieved with disparate properties: a nearly commensurate Ag(1) lattice stabilized by vacancy and line defects in epitaxial graphene, and a denser Ag(2) phase preferentially grown with sp3-rich zero-layer graphene. Structural and spectroscopic characterization confirm lattice registry with the SiC substrate, while theoretical calculations reveal a thermodynamic preference for Ag(2) but an easier nucleation for Ag(1). Both phases are found to be semiconducting, with the Ag(2) phase exhibiting slightly enhanced n-doping of graphene. Notably, nonlinear optical measurements reveal a three-order magnitude difference in second-order susceptibility between the two phases, demonstrating promise for phase-tunable 2D metals in reconfigurable optoelectronic and metamaterial platforms.</p>

            <p>Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</p>

In this work, we simulate PbTe and PbSe heterostructures manufactured via (1) direct wave bonding and (2) heteroepitaxial growth.

To compute the surface energy of interfaces, we measure the interaction energy across surfaces using a well-verified code. Compared with hypothetical interfaces modeled to be coherent, a typical assumption in traditional slab-based methods, the surface energy of wafer bonded and epitaxially grown interfaces are significantly different. Semi-coherent interfaces exhibit up to ~27% lower surface energies than coherent ones, while coherent models overestimate surface energies by up to ~50% relative to epitaxial interfaces. The consequence of such differences can lead to conflicting predictions of physical phenomena such as fracture toughness or growth mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muneeb ur Rahman</p>
            <p>The catalytic CO2 photoreduction to CO is significantly hindered by the pervasive kinetic bottleneck of *CO-desorption and inefficient charge separation. Surpassing the conventional single photocatalytic strategy, herein, a multi-synergetic 0D/1D S-scheme heterojunction by precisely assembling 0D InVO4 nanoparticles on 1D Cu-doped TbFeO3 (IVO/CTFO). This nano-heterojunction is rationally designed at multiple steps where Cu2+ substitution at the Fe3+ site induces a compression in lattice strain and oxygen vacancies (VO), acting as electron traps and CO2 chemisorption sites, which breaks spin-polarization of pristine TbFeO3 to facilitate multichannel charge flow. The 0D/1D strategy couples the maximum surface active-sites and short charge diffusion routes with directional charge migration. Moreover, a 0D/1D lattice mismatch creates a built-in electric field at the interface, resulting in an enhanced lifetime (64.70 ns) of charged species, an efficient CO yield (65.75 mmole g-1.h-1), and high selectivity (95.93%). DFT calculations and experimental findings confirmed the Fermi level shift toward the conduction band and the existence of spin-hybridization. Operando-DRIFTS and the free-energy diagram unveil a H+ mediated mechanism at the interface, alongside a reduction in energy barrier for CO2 photoreduction from *COOH to *CO. Thus, this study presents an excellent approach that integrates defect-engineering, strain-compression, and interfacial design in advancing solar fuels production.</p>

            <p>Among all-inorganic halide perovskites, the only known ferroelectrics are the family of CsGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). Here, we study their ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) and common point defects by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigate the interplay between DWs and defects. The most stable defects are V$_{\text{X}}$ and V$_{\text{Cs}}$ and the former shows low migration barriers and high mobility. In contrast to oxide ferroelectrics, the affinity between point defects and DWs is negligible, reflecting the subtle structural distortions at CsGeX$_3$ DWs. Concomitantly, the formation energies and migration energy barriers of CsGeX$_3$ DWs are small compared to oxides, and neither V$_{\text{X}}$ nor V$_{\text{Cs}}$ pin migrating DWs. The band gap invariance across DWs and the lack of affinity towards intrinsic charged point defects imply that conducting DWs for nanoelectronics may be challenging to realise in CsGeX$_3$. However, shallow $p$-type defect levels and low hole effective masses suggest that high $p$-type conductivity may be achievable in nominally ferroelectric CsGeX$_3$. The low DW migration energy barriers and insignificant DW pinning by point defects make CsGeX$_3$ promising materials as robust soft ferroelectrics for high-frequency switching applications with low energy dissipation.</p>

            <p>Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.</p>

Starting from the master equation and performing a coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for $m$ and the fraction of defects. Using central manifold theory, we analytically show that $m$ decays asymptotically as $t^{-1/2}$ along the critical line, and as $t^{-1/4}$ at the tricritical point. This result implies that the dynamical critical exponent is $z=2$, proving that the macroscopic critical dynamics of the Nagle-Kardar model falls within the dynamic universality class of purely relaxational dynamics with a non-conserved order parameter (model A). Large deviation techniques enable us to show that the average first passage time between local equilibrium states follows an Arrhenius law.</p>

            <p>The Kondo effect emerges when a localized spin is screened by conduction electrons, giving rise to a strongly-correlated many-body ground state. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot, focusing on the spatial extension of the Kondo screening cloud in the electron reservoirs. To probe its properties, the dot is coupled to an electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometer, enabling controlled modulation of the density of states at the Fermi level. The observation of Kondo temperature oscillations indicates a Kondo screening length comparable to the cavity size. Furthermore, we explore how the coupling asymmetry with the two reservoirs affects both the amplitude and the phase of the conductance oscillations, revealing a subtle interplay between coherent transport and Kondo effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsz Wai Ko, Runze Liu, Adesh Rohan Mishra, Zihan Yu</p>
            <p>Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Green's Functions of Strongly Correlated Hubbard Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateo Cárdenes Wuttig</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that a machine learning framework based on kernel ridge regression can encode and predict the self-energy of one-dimensional Hubbard models using only mean-field features such as static and dynamic Hartree-Fock quantities and first-order GW calculations. This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t > 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.</p>

            <h2>From Fresh to Salty: How Ions Modulate Solvent-Mediated Interactions between Grafted Silica Nanoparticles in Water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuvraj Singh, Chandan K. Choudhury, Rakesh S. Singh</p>
            <p>Nanoparticles (NPs) are fundamental building blocks for engineering functional soft materials, where precise control over the solvent-mediated inter-particle effective interaction (Ueff) is essential for tailoring bulk structure and properties. These solvent-mediated interactions are strongly influenced by NP's surface chemistry, solvent properties, and thermodynamic conditions such as temperature (T) and pressure (P). However, despite considerable progress, a general predictive framework for tuning Ueff and guiding self-assembly remains lacking. In this work, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the alteration of Ueff between silica nanoparticles (Si-NPs) functionalized with polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by salt (sodium chloride) across a range of thermodynamic conditions. At ambient thermodynamic conditions, bare (not functionalized) Si-NPs exhibit minimal variation in Ueff even at high salt concentrations. In contrast, PE-grafted Si-NPs display strong salt-induced attractions, while PEG-grafted Si-NPs show an intermediate, more gradual response. To asses the transferability of these salt-induced effects on effective interactions, we further examined the effects of salt on Ueff under different (T,P) conditions. Our results indicate that the salt-induced modulation of Ueff between both bare and grafted Si-NPs is largely invariant across the explored (T,P) conditions. Molecular-level analysis reveals that salt promotes solvent depletion within the interparticle cavity for both hydrophobic PE and hydrophilic PEG grafts, with the strongest effect observed in the PE case. In general, this study highlights the coupled roles of surface chemistry, ion-polymer interactions, and solvent structuring in the regulation of Ueff, and provides important insights into the predictable control of interparticle interactions for soft material engineering.</p>

            <p>We present a density-functional theory study of the effects of oxygen vacancies on the structural and electronic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$). Our motivation is the reported suppression of the metal-insulator transition by oxygen vacancies and the lack of a clear consensus on its origin. We use the DFT$+V$ method with a static intersite vanadium-vanadium interaction term, $V$, to calculate the properties of the oxygen-deficient metallic rutile and insulating monoclinic M1 phases of VO$_2$ on the same footing. We find that oxygen vacancies induce local distortions in the M1 phase, but do not destroy the dimerization usually associated with the insulating behavior. In spite of this, we find that the M1 phase becomes metallic as a result of the partial filling of the conduction band due to a rigid-band-like doping effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaoyi Li, Dai-Wei Qu, Bin-Bin Chen, Tao Shi, Wei Li</p>
            <p>Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.</p>

            <h2>Persistence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition with long-range couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Walther, Josef Willsher, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is an archetypal example of a topological phase transition, which is driven by the proliferation of vortices. In this Letter, we analyze the persistence of the BKT transition in the XY model under the influence of long-range algebraically decaying interactions of the form $\sim 1/{r^{2+\sigma}}$. The model hosts a magnetized low temperature phase for sufficiently small $\sigma$. Crucially, in the presence of long-range interactions, spin waves renormalize the interaction between vortices, which stabilizes the BKT transition. As a result, we find that there is no direct transition from the magnetized to the disordered phase and that the BKT transition persists for arbitrary long-range exponents, which is distinct from previous results. We use both Landau-Peierls-type arguments and renormalization group calculations - including a coupling between spin wave and topological excitations - and obtain similar results. We emphasize that Landau-Peierls-type arguments are a powerful tool for analyzing continuous spin models. We discuss the relevance of our findings for current Rydberg atom experiments, and highlight the importance of long-range couplings for other types of topological defects.</p>

            <p>Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.</p>

Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.</p>

We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9° sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity.

            <h2>Machine-Learning Accelerated Calculations of Reduced Density Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Awwab A. Azam, Lexu Zhao, Jiabin Yu</p>
            <p>$n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\times 6 \sim 8\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\%$ and $92.78\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.</p>

An increase in the Mn substitution up to 30% leads to a significant decrease in the dielectric permittivity, left shift of its maximum, and induces a pronounced frequency dispersion of the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature, which is inherent to relaxor-like this http URL of the model with experiments reveal the coexistence of the ordered ferroelectric-like and disordered relaxor-like phases in the multiferroic solid solutions PFN-Mn and PFT-Mn.</p>

However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis. Our work sheds light upon the interplay between topological and symmetry-breaking orders as well as their detection via tensor networks.</p>

Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.</p>

            <p>Structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers (SNAPPs) are emerging as promising selective agents against bacterial membranes. In this study, we used all atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the interaction of a promising cationic SNAPP architecture (Alt-SNAPP with 8 arms made of alternating lysine and valine residues) with modelled Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mammalian, and red blood cell membranes. Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity.</p>

Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.</p>

Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{é} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states.

            <p>We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.</p>

            <p>The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.</p>

            <p>Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.</p>

            <h2>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This document establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Anomaly of Kogut-Susskind Fermion in (3+1)-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoto Aoki, Yoshio Kikukawa, Toshinari Takemoto</p>
            <p>We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.</p>

            <h2>A Bilayer Cathode Design Procedure for Li ion Batteries Using the Multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman Model (M-DFN)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. C. Tredenick, A. M. Boyce, R. Drummond, S. R. Duncan</p>
            <p>Heterogeneities in lithium ion batteries can be significant factors in electrode under utilisation and degradation while charging. Bilayer electrodes have been proposed as a convenient and scalable way to homogenise the electrode response. In this paper, the design of a bilayer cathode for Li-ion batteries composed of separate layers of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC622) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) is optimised using the multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman (M-DFN) model. Changes to the carbon binder domain, electrolyte volume fraction, and tortuosity provided the greatest control for improving Li-ion charge mobility. The optimised bilayer design was able to charge at 3C between 0-90% SOC in 18.6 minutes, achieving 4.4 mAh/cm2. Comparing the optimal bilayer to the LFP-only electrode, the bilayer achieved 41% higher capacity. Through mechanistic physics-based modelling, it was shown that the 3C charging improvement of the optimised bilayer was achieved by enabling a more homogeneous current density distribution through the thickness of the electrode and electrolyte depletion prevention. The findings were confirmed on a high-fidelity X-ray computed tomography (CT) based microstructural model. The results illustrate how modelling can be used to rapidly search novel electrode designs</p>

            <h2>Global Buckley--Leverett for Multicomponent Flow in Fractured Media: Isothermal Equation-of-State Coupling and Dynamic Capillarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Tantardini, Fernando Alonso-Marroquin</p>
            <p>We present an isothermal Global Buckley--Leverett framework for multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous and fractured media that retains the interpretability of classical Buckley--Leverett while incorporating essential physics: equation of state-based phase behavior, multicomponent Maxwell--Stefan diffusion, dynamic capillarity, stress-sensitive permeability, and non-Darcy fracture flow. The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided. The model reduces exactly to classical Buckley--Leverett when added physics are disabled, making it a practical backbone for carbon storage and contaminant transport in fractured, compositionally complex reservoirs.</p>

            <h2>Do Discrete Fine-Scale Mechanical Models with Rotational Degrees of Freedom Homogenize Into a Cosserat or a Cauchy Continuum?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Eliáš, Gianluca Cusatis</p>
            <p>This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.</p>

This decomposition uncovers a multiscaling in the 2D inverse cascade, which remains obscured when using conventional structure functions. Our results highlight a decoupling between velocity amplitude and flow geometry, offering new insight into the statistical structure of turbulent cascades as well as showing how different classes of multiscaling emerge.</p>

            <p>The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for one quasi-particle excitations in the thermodynamic limit via cluster-additive block-diagonalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.</p>

            <h2>Local metamaterials and transition layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimya Yadollahpour, Hossein Khodavirdi, Ankit Srivastava</p>
            <p>In this paper, we elucidate the concept of local acoustic metamaterials. These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitesh Kumar Patro, Washington Taylor, Akshit Goyal</p>
            <p>Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.</p>

Consequently, monomer vacancies destabilize the lattice due to the inherent structural loss of tubulin-tubulin contacts and the additive acceleration of fracture through multiple seams. Importantly, the comparison of our simulations with experiments on lattice fracture suggests that the intrinsic ratio of longitudinal to lateral binding energies is bounded at approximately 1.5, challenging previous predictions of lattice anisotropy from tip-growth models and highlighting the urgent need to incorporate into current growth models parameters obtained from lattice dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janani G, Deepak Bhat</p>
            <p>In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.</p>

            <p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are uniquely capable of providing exact simulations of quantum many-body systems. Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)].</p>

            <p>Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imogen Camp, Nick G. Jones</p>
            <p>Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</p>

Here we review two calculations, relevant for fundamental properties and applications of color superconductivity, respectively: the weak-coupling QCD calculation of the fermionic energy gap together with the magnetic screening masses of the gauge bosons, and the calculation of bulk viscosity from a non-leptonic electroweak process. These calculations are supplemented by a discussion of color superconductors with mismatched Fermi momenta, and they are embedded in the context of the state of the art by giving an overview of previous and ongoing work and future directions.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly, Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles. As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p> 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p > 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</p>

            <h2>Effect of shape on void growth: A coupled Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (DDP) study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Usman, Sana Waheed, Aamir Mubashar</p>
            <p>Voids are one of the many material defects present at the microscopic length scale. They are primarily responsible for the formation of cracks and hence contribute to ductile fracture. Circular voids tend to deform into elliptical voids just before their coalescence to form cracks. The principle aim of this study is to investigate the effect of void shape on the micro-mechanism of void growth by using Discrete Dislocation Plasticity simulations. For voided crystals, conventional DDP produces a continuous slip step throughout the material even if a dislocation escapes from a non-convex domain. To overcome this issue, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is used here to incorporate the displacement discontinuity. Different aspect ratios of elliptical voids are considered under uniaxial and biaxial deformation boundary conditions. The results suggest that voids having the largest surface area tend to have maximum growth rate as compared to void with lower surface area, i.e. "larger is faster". Under biaxial loading, a higher magnitude of strain hardening, and void growth rate are observed as compared to uniaxial loading. The results also suggest that the orientation of slip planes as well as voids, affect the overall plastic behavior of the voided-ductile material. Furthermore, circular void tends to induce minimum growth rate but have the maximum strain hardening effect as compared to other void shapes under both loading conditions. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of ductile fracture with applications in manufacturing industry, aerospace industry and in the design of nano/micro-electromechanical devices i.e. NEMS/MEMS.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement-driven responses through multiscale 3D-printed knits</h2>

            <p>For their resilience and toughness, filamentous entanglements are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems across length scales, from polymer-chain- to collagen-networks and from cable-net structures to forest canopies. Textiles are an everyday manifestation of filamentous entanglement: the remarkable resilience and toughness in knitted fabrics arise predominately from the topology of interlooped yarns. Yet most architected materials do not exploit entanglement as a design primitive, and industrial knitting fixes a narrow set of patterns for manufacturability. Additive manufacturing has recently enabled interlocking structures such as chainmail, knot and woven assemblies, hinting at broader possibilities for entangled architectures. The general challenge is to treat knitting itself as a three-dimensional architected material with predictable and tunable mechanics across scales. Here, we show that knitted architectures fabricated additively can be recast as periodic entangled solids whose responses are both fabric-like and programmable. We reproduce the characteristic behavior of conventional planar knits and extend knitting into the third dimension by interlooping along three orthogonal directions, yielding volumetric knits whose stiffness and dissipation are tuned by prescribed pre-strain. We propose a simple scaling that unifies the responses across stitch geometries and constituent materials. Further, we realize the same topology from centimeter to micrometer scales, culminating in the fabrication of what is, to our knowledge, the smallest knitted structure ever made. By demonstrating 3D-printed knits can be interpreted both as a traditional fabric, as well as a novel architected material with defined periodicity, this work establishes the dual nature of entangled filaments and paves the way towards a new form of material architectures with high degrees of entanglement.</p>

The system approaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range interactions induced by the simultaneous resetting. Despite the presence of strong correlations, we show that several observables can be computed exactly, which include the global average density, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th rightmost particle and the spacing distribution between two successive particles. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also discuss a possible experimental realisation of this resetting gas using optical traps.</p>

            <h2>Classical uncertainty relations and entropy production in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Luca Peliti</p>
            <p>We analyze Fürth's 1933 classical uncertainty relations in the modern language of stochastic differential equations. Our interest is motivated by applications to non-equilibrium classical statistical mechanics. We show that Fürth's uncertainty relations are a property enjoyed by martingales under the measure of a diffusion process. This result implies a lower bound on fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof Gawȩdzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition. Finally, we illustrate how Fürth's relations admit a straightforward extension to piecewise deterministic processes. We thus show that the results in the paper concern properties enjoyed by general Markov processes.</p>

            <h2>Full Counting Statistics of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas</p>
            <p>With the help of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has become possible to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here, we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic situations.</p>

            <h2>Fermi Surface Bosonization for Non-Fermi Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SangEun Han, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical frameworks. Inspired by recent work [Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)], we present a procedure for bosonizing Fermi surfaces that does not rely on the existence of sharp excitation and is thus directly applicable to non-Fermi liquids. Our method involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion and can be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative means. By offering an alternative method directly applicable to studying the low-energy physics of Fermi and non-Fermi liquids, our work potentially stands as an important building block in advancing the comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Roughness and critical force for depinning at 3-loop order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail N. Semeikin, Kay Joerg Wiese</p>
            <p>A $d$-dimensional elastic manifold at depinning is described by a renormalized field theory, based on the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG). Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 + {\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate $\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal A}(d) m^2 \ln (m) + f_{\rm c}^0 $, with $\tilde {\cal A}(d) = -\partial_n \big[\nu(d,n)^{-1}+\eta(d,n)\big]_{n=-2}$, reminiscent of log-CFTs.</p>

The result is owing to the fact that the instantaneous eigenstates approach is applicable in more wide parameter range compared with the time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Analysis from the results of quantum master equation shows that the insulator effect is originated from coherent localization of atom wave packets in optical wells.</p>

            <h2>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshya Bhardwaj, Lea E. Bottini, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari</p>
            <p>Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</p>

            <p>The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.</p>

            <p>In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</p>

            <p>Bipolaronic superconductivity is an exotic pairing mechanism proposed for materials like Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ (BKBO); however, conclusive experimental evidence for a (bi)polaron metallic state in this material remains elusive. Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling ($e$-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability</p>

            <p>Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raisa Fabiha, Patrick J. Taylor, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Antennas are the quintessential means to communicate information wirelessly over long distances via electromagnetic waves. Traditional antennas have two shortcomings that have prevented miniaturization: (1) their radiation efficiencies plummet and (2) they radiate isotropically when miniaturized to small fractions of the radiated wavelength. Here, we report a new genre of non-classical antennas that overcome these limitations by employing non-traditional principles and harnessing topological insulators. An alternating charge current of frequency 1-10 GHz injected into a thin film of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) injects a spin current of alternating spin polarization into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This generates spin waves in the nanomagnets, which radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing an antenna. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as that of the current. The antenna dimension is only 0.6-1.8% of the free space wavelength and yet it radiates with an efficiency several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical limit for conventional antennas. Furthermore, it radiates anisotropically (despite being a "point source") and one can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which changes the spin wave patterns within the nanomagnets because of spin-momentum locking in the 3D-TI. This enables beam steering without the use of a phased array. We have overcome several limitations of classical antennas by harnessing the quantum mechanical attributes of a quantum material, namely a 3D-TI.</p>

Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored.

Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct paths, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight the electrolyte's role in tuning charge carrier dynamics, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized lever for enabling novel device functionalities.</p>

We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moiré matter beyond one billion sites</h2>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Christian Ohnmacht, Valentin Wilhelm, Wolfgang Belzig</p>
            <p>Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</p>

            <h2>In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayden Robertson, Joanne Zimmer, Anuar Sifuentes Name, Cassia Lux, Sebastian Stock, Regine von Klitzing, Olaf Soltwedel</p>
            <p>For studying the structure of microgel particles at the air/water interface, specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. Herein we investigate the vertical and lateral structure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels (MGs) at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer onto solid substrates. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing the results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study demonstrates a clear transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: the distance between the particles decreased during LB-transfer, and at high pressures ($\Pi\,>\,17\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches debuted here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.</p>

            <h2>Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is encoded in a specific microscopic pattern of density waves and phase excitations that can be addressed within the experimental cold atoms capabilities. This work paves the way for tunable amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing. At the same time, our analysis provides the microscopic explanation of the general notion of parametric amplification occurring in nonlinear coherent devices.</p>

            <h2>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Aditya Savanur, Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau-damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs) for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focused on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs as well, which, however, turn out to have no effect on the solutions. Decomposing the master equation into angular-momentum ($\ell$) channels, the emergent modes are of two types: Fermi-surface deformations with discrete spectra and particle-hole excitations forming a continuous band. The long-lived zero-sound mode, which corresponds to $\ell = 0$, is found to be robust against damping effects. Intriguingly, we have an infinite family of discrete modes corresponding to higher-order harmonics of the net deformation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo A. L. Forão, Fernando S. Filho, Pedro V. Paraguassú</p>
            <p>Collisional Brownian engines have attracted significant attention due to their simplicity, experimental accessibility, and amenability to exact analytical solutions. While previous research has predominantly focused on optimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical properties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how thermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values exceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis demonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the probability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting fluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be probabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class of engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully determined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how stochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic bounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.</p>

            <p>The correlation properties of nonaffine elastic response in strongly disordered materials are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices and numerical models. The random matrix theory shows that the divergence of the nonaffine displacement field has large-scale exponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\xi$ is determined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large, significantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of the nonaffine displacement field has the same length scale $\xi$ except the case of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are confirmed by the numerical investigation of the rigidity percolation model and the molecular dynamics simulations of a model polystyrene in the amorphous state.</p>

Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations - strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Rusconi, Christina Schenk, Razvan Ceuca, Arghir Zarnescu, Elena Akhmatskaya</p>
            <p>The description of complex physical phenomena often involves sophisticated models that rely on a large number of parameters, with many dimensions and scales. One practical way to simplify that kind of models is to discard some of the parameters, or terms of underlying equations, thus giving rise to reduced models. Here, we propose a general approach to obtaining such reduced models. The method is independent of the model in use, i.e., equation-free, depends only on the interplay between the scales and dimensions involved in the description of the phenomena, and controls over-parametrization. It also quantifies conditions for asymptotic models by providing explicitly computable thresholds on values of parameters that allow for reducing complexity of a model, while preserving essential predictive properties. Although our focus is on complexity reduction, this approach may also help with calibration by mitigating the risks of over-parameterization and instability in parameter estimation. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the context of the classical projectile model.</p>

            <p>We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and average local density of states (Average-LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</p>

            <p>Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</p>

From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.</p>

            <p>We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</p>

Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale.

            <p>We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet on a square lattice. Our study reveals that the propagation of spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior, i.e., spin waves traveling in opposite directions display asymmetry in energy dispersion $\omega({\bf q}) \ne \omega(-{\bf q)}$, which also results in an asymmetric behavior of group velocity, spin stiffness, etc. We find that this asymmetric behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned inside the atomic plane, while the excitations remain symmetric for out-of-plane magnetization. The first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Sireci, Luca Peliti, Daniel Maria Busiello</p>
            <p>Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states (NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear. Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics. Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual) components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces. We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium conditions.</p>

            <h2>The viscoelastic rheology of transient diffusion creep</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John F. Rudge</p>
            <p>Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains produced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes: a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these simple models.</p>

            <p>We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</p>

            <p>Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA$_{2}$Sn$_{\mathrm{x}}$Pb$_{1-\mathrm{x}}$I$_{4}$ (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA$_{2}$SnI$_{4}$ are substantially more chiral than in MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.</p>

            <h2>YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics</h2>

            <p>Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum properties of magnons to advance nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material typically grown as thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) for lattice matching. However, paramagnetic GGG introduces detrimental damping at low temperatures due to substrate magnetization, undermining quantum applications. Here, we study magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a yttrium scandium gallium aluminum garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy down to 30$\,$mK, we compare YIG/YSGAG with a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. We demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low damping from 300$\,$K to 30$\,$mK, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$ at room temperature, comparable to the best YIG/GGG films and bulk YIG, with no low-temperature upturn. The diamagnetic substrate eliminates the dissipation mechanisms that dominate on magnetized GGG, preserving low magnetic damping across the full temperature range. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>A perspective on inelastic light scattering spectroscopy for probing transport of collective acoustic excitations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyemin Kim, Hyungseok Kim, Taeyong Kim</p>
            <p>Understanding and manipulating nanoscale energy transport and conversion processes are essential for diverse applications, ranging from thermoelectrics and energy harvesting to thermal management of microelectronics. While it has long been recognized that acoustic and thermal properties in condensed matters are primarily due to microscopic transport of phonons as quasiparticles, probing thermal acoustic excitations particularly at sub-THz remains a challenge primarily due to limitations in experimental techniques with spatiotemporal resolutions pertinent to probing them. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and its variant, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering (ISS), provide access to these thermal acoustic excitations, enabling measurement of quantities such as acoustic dispersions along with relaxation dynamics occurring in ultrasonic as well as hypersonic frequencies. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of the operational principles of BLS and ISS, and highlight their applications in probing acoustic, thermal, and magnetic excitations in emerging and low-dimensional materials. We conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities for advanced material characterization using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu</p>
            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</p>

            <h2>Bridging the Synthesizability Gap in Perovskites by Combining Computations, Literature Data, and PU Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushik Desai, Junyeong Ahn, Alejandro Strachan, Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi</p>
            <p>Among emerging energy materials, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have garnered significant attention over the last decade owing to the abundance of their constituent species, low manufacturing costs, and their highly tunable composition-structure-property space. Navigating the vast perovskite compositional landscape is possible using density functional theory (DFT) computations, but they are not easily extended to predictions of the synthesizability of new materials and their properties. As a result, only a limited number of compositions identified to have desirable optoelectronic properties from these calculations have been realized experimentally. One way to bridge this gap is by learning from the experimental literature about how the perovskite composition-structure space relates to their likelihood of laboratory synthesis. Here, we present our efforts in combining high-throughput DFT data with experimental labels collected from the literature to train classifier models employing various materials descriptors to forecast the synthesizability of any given perovskite compound. Our framework utilizes the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning strategy and makes probabilistic estimates of the synthesis likelihood based on DFT- computed energies and the prior existence of similar synthesized compounds. Our data and models can be readily accessed via a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) nanoHUB tool.</p>

            <p>This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</p>

Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p>

Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitin Kumar, Nicholas Jerla, John Ponis, Sarbajit Banerjee, G. Sambandamurthy</p>
            <p>The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline $\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe electron dynamics across the Na-ion-ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO) transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)), structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern, breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating. These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Toussaint</p>
            <p>We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices: instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a topological superconducting wire, the exponentially small energy splitting $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$ provides protection against local perturbations but renders it highly susceptible to pure dephasing from low-frequency environmental noise. We show that coupling via a parity-conserving operator ($i\gamma_L\gamma_R$) to a bosonic environment yields a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto S(\epsilon)$, where $S(\epsilon)$ is the environmental noise power at the qubit splitting frequency. In the experimentally relevant regime where $k_B T \gtrsim \hbar\epsilon$ (with $T \sim 10-100$ mK), the noise power scales as $S(\epsilon) \propto \rho(\epsilon) k_B T/\hbar\epsilon$, leading to a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto \rho(\epsilon) T/\epsilon$. This exposes a fundamental challenge: the dephasing rate diverges as $1/\epsilon$ for a standard environment, e.g., a 1D system with linear dispersion where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is constant. We overcome this by designing environments with a suppressed density of states following $\rho_{\text{engineered}}(\epsilon) = \rho_{\text{free}}(\epsilon) (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. This creates an ``inverse Purcell effect'' that yields a temperature-independent suppression factor $F_P = (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. For $\alpha > 1$, the engineered dephasing rate decreases exponentially with wire length, $\Gamma_{\phi,\text{engineered}} \propto e^{-(\alpha-1)L/\xi}$, meaning longer wires provide better coherence protection. This provides a quantitative design principle where environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for coherence stabilization, while respecting fermion parity superselection rules.</p>

            <p>Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static, perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$ resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from the Fröhlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a ``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of ``Planckian speed limit''.</p>

            <p>Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al., Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena.</p>

            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p>The study-to-study variability of bedload flux measurements in turbulent sediment transport borders an order of magnitude, even for idealized laboratory conditions. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a universal method of bed shear stress determination. It consists of a physically-based definition of the bed surface and a channel sidewall correction that does not rely on empirical elements, except for well-established scaling coefficients associated with Kolmogórov's theory of turbulence. Application of this method to bedload transport of spherical grains -- to rule out grain shape effects -- collapses data from existing laboratory measurements and grain-resolved CFD-DEM simulations for various channel geometries onto a single curve. In contrast, classical sidewall corrections, as well as an alternative bed surface definition, are unable to universally capture these data, especially those from shallow or very narrow channel flows. We then apply our method to an extended grain-shape-controlled data compilation, complemented by literature data for non-spherical grains and from grain-unresolved CFD-DEM simulations. This compilation covers a very diverse range of transport conditions, ranging from very narrow to infinitely wide channels, from shallow to deep channel flows, from mild to steep bed slopes, and from weak to intense transport. We generalize an existing physical bedload flux model to account for grain shape variability and show that it explains almost all the compiled data within a factor of only $1.3$.</p>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</p>

The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies.

Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$.

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in the field of chemistry and materials science. However, constructing a single universal MLIP that can accurately model molecular and crystalline systems remains challenging. A central obstacle is the integration of diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. We present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), which is an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source MLIP model based on a unified dataset covering molecular and crystalline systems. This universal model displays strong performances across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting similar or improved accuracies in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to those of specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracies for inorganic systems. These advancements pave the way for accelerated discoveries in the fields of chemistry and materials science via genuine foundation models for chemistry.</p>

            <p>We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanzhou Zhu, Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh</p>
            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</p>

We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Bell, Yan Wang, Kevin C. Smith, Yuan Liu, Eugene Dumitrescu, S. M. Girvin</p>
            <p>We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

            <h2>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang</p>
            <p>With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p>

            <h2>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Doi, Tadashi Takayanagi</p>
            <p>We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</p>

But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</p>

            <p>We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Mollabashi, Mohammad-Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</p>

By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$.

            <p>We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</p>

The spin magnetization on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function. Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system.

The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</p>

The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

            <p>Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</p>

            <h2>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenfeng Ouyang, Jing Jiang, Jian-Feng Zhang, Miao Gao, Kai Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>A very recent report claims that ambient-pressure high-temperature ($T_c$) superconductivity was found in boron-doped three-dimensional networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Here, we systematically study the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of one-dimensional (1D) (3,0) CNT under ambient pressure. Our results show that the EPC constant $\lambda$ of the undoped 1D (3,0) CNT is 0.70, and reduces to 0.44 after 1.3 holes/cell doping. Further calculations show that the undoped (3,0) CNT is a two-gap superconductor with a superconducting $T_c$ $\sim$ 33 K under ambient pressure. Additionally, we identify three characteristic phonon modes with strong EPC, establishing that the pristine (3,0) CNT is a high-$T_c$ superconducting unit, and further suggest that searching for those superconducting units with strong EPC phonon mode would be an effective way to discover high-$T_c$ phonon-mediated superconductors. Our study not only provide a crucial and timely theoretical reference for the recent report regarding superconducting CNTs, but also uncover that the pristine (3,0) CNT hosts the highest record of superconducting $T_c$ among the elemental superconductors under ambient pressure.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of the Schmid-Higgs Mode in $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Awelewa, Maxim Dzero</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of the longitudinal collective mode in an unconventional superconductor. For concreteness, we assume that the superconductor is described by a $d$-wave order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry. After the superconductor has been suddenly subjected to a perturbation at time $t=0$, the order parameter exhibits a peculiar oscillatory behavior, with the amplitude of the oscillations slowly decaying with time in a power-law fashion. Assuming that the initial perturbation is weak, we use a formalism based on quasi-classical approach to superconductivity to determine both the frequency of the oscillations as well as how fast these oscillations decay with time by evaluating the time dependence of the pairing susceptibility. We find that the frequency of the oscillations is given by twice the value of the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction and its amplitude decays as $1/t^2$. The results are also verified by a direct calculation of the order parameter dynamics by numerically solving the equations of motion for the Anderson pseudospins.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic spinon theory of the hourglass spin excitation spectrum of the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Nikolaenko, Pietro M. Bonetti, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We present a theory for the spin fluctuation spectrum of the hole-doped cuprates in a ground state with period 4 unidirectional charge density wave (`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the `hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilia Moiseenko, Olga Polischuk, Viacheslav Muravev, Dmitry Svintsov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition $L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the metal edges.</p>

            <p>Even in the quantum limit, non-equilibrium quasiparticle (QP) populations induce QP poisoning that irreversibly relaxes the quantum state and significantly degrades the coherence of transmon qubits. A particularly detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation. At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within $\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of $\sim$34\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta per $\mathrm{\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.</p>

            <p>Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region.</p>

            <h2>Polariton XY-simulators revisited</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhui Cao, Denis Novokreschenov, Alexey Kavokin</p>
            <p>Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of polariton-based XY simulators.</p>

            <h2>High-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Buckled Honeycomb Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Hafez-Torbati, Götz S. Uhrig</p>
            <p>We propose Néel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized, depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize a high-$T$ AFCI phase.</p>

            <p>In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. The pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. Here, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with anisotropy exceeding 80% and a gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originating from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the Fermi surface occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our direct observation of the Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic pairing in CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding the intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</p>

            <p>Localized $5d^2$ electrons in a cubic crystal field possess multipoles such as electric quadrupoles and magnetic octupoles. We studied the cubic double perovskite Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ containing the Os$^{6+}$ ($5d^2$) ions, which exhibits a phase transition to a `hidden order' below $T^* \sim$ 50 K, by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Os $L_{2,3}$ edge. The cubic ligand-field splitting between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ levels of Os $5d$ was deduced by XAS to be $\sim$4 eV. The temperature dependence of the XMCD spectra was consistent with a $\sim$18 meV residual cubic splitting of the lowest $J_{\rm eff} =$ 2 multiplet state into the non-Kramers $E_g$ doublet ground state and the $T_{2g}$ triplet excited state. Ligand-field (LF) multiplet calculation under fictitious strong magnetic fields indicated that the exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor octupoles should be as strong as $\sim$1.5 meV if a ferro-octupole order is stabilized in the `hidden-ordered' state, consistent with the exchange interaction of $\sim$1 meV previously predicted theoretically using model and density functional theory calculations.</p>

            <p>Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution.</p>

All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects.

            <p>Radiation-induced defects can have a significant impact on the longevity and performance of semiconductor devices. We present an Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method that integrates first-principles defect properties and experimentally measured parameters into a device model to dynamically simulate the defect chemistry in semiconductors. For a silicon-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) material, we showcase three capabilities: (i) Fermi level $E_F$ movement including its component electron and hole Fermi levels, (ii) dynamical charge equilibration with the arsenic vacancy serving as an example, and a (iii) diffusion-driven reaction between Coulomb attracted gallium interstitial ($Ga_i$) and arsenic vacancy ($v_{As}$). Governed by charge carrier reactions, the electron and hole Fermi levels remained dissimilar until equilibrium was achieved at $E_F\approx1.32$ eV. The equilibrium Fermi level was verified by successfully identifying $v_{As}^{3-}$ as the most populated charge state within the arsenic vacancy defect. Lastly, a Coulomb attraction, created by the shifted Fermi level and the charge equilibration process, between $Ga_i^{1+}$ and $v_{As}^{3-}$ resulted in the formation of a doubly negative gallium antisite ($Ga_{As}^{2-}$). The AIDE method can access experimentally inaccessible short-time and low-concentration regimes, is generalizable to other more complex systems (e.g., indium gallium arsenide), and, after solving open problems in GaAs, will serve as a virtual experiment to bound estimates for difficult-to-measure physical quantities.</p>

            <p>Second-order nonlinear optical materials enable frequency doubling of light (second-harmonic generation, SHG), which is essential for optoelectronic applications ranging from materials characterization to quantum technologies. However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies.</p>

            <p>We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</p>

            <h2>Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur</p>
            <p>An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes, i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when including perturbations.</p>

            <h2>Giant field-tunable nonlinear Hall effect by Lorentz skew scattering in a graphene moire superlattice</h2>

            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient, magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond electrostatic gating.</p>

            <p>We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator (cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to $\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruth H. Tichauer, Maksim Lednev, Gerrit Groenhof, Johannes Feist</p>
            <p>In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.</p>

            <p>The integration of single-atom bits enables the realization of the highest data-density memory. Reading and writing information to these bits through mechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices with low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary goal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and write the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium this http URL explain this writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale mechano-spintronics.</p>

            <p>Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.</p>

            <h2>From Lasers to Photon Bose--Einstein Condensates: A Unified Description via an Open-Dissipative Bose--Einstein Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Krauß, Enrico Stein, Axel Pelster</p>
            <p>Photon condensation was first experimentally realized in 2010 within a dye-filled microcavity at room temperature. Since then, interest in the field has increased significantly, as a photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) represents a prototypical driven-dissipative system. Here, we investigate how its inherent open nature influences the condensation process both quantitatively and qualitatively. To this end, we consider a mean-field model, which can be derived microscopically from a Lindblad master equation. The underlying rate equations depend on various external parameters such as emission and absorption rates of the dye molecules as well as the cavity photon loss rate. In steady state, we obtain an open-dissipative Bose-Einstein distribution for the mode occupations. The chemical potential of this distribution depends on the occupations of the dye molecules in both their ground and excited state and must therefore be determined self-consistently. We find that the resulting photon distribution is strongly influenced by the driven-dissipative parameters. Based on this result, we identify the main differences between a photonic BEC, an atomic BEC, and a laser.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic-like Quasiparticles in Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer</p>
            <p>Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that are of central importance for fundamental research and technological applications. Unfortunately, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric support multiferroic-like quasiparticles, termed ``multiferrons", that simultaneously carry \emph{static} magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of circularly polarized phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, multiferrons cause, apart from Zeeman and Einstein-de Haas effects, a linear dc Stark response, giant electric-field-tunable second-harmonic generation in the THz-frequency regime, and a finite magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic functionalities with simple ferroelectrics.</p>

            <p>Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxiao Hang, Rosa Di Felice, Aiichiro Nakano, Stephan Haas</p>
            <p>The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.</p>

We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases.

            <h2>Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.</p>

Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling.

            <p>The coherence of hole spin qubits in germanium planar heterostructures is limited by the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath due to 29Si and 73Ge isotopes. Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2 and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography. Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x 10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10 cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform for long-coherence spin qubits.</p>

            <p>The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms.</p>

            <p>The electron self-interaction problem in density functional theory affects the accurate modeling of polarons, particularly their localization and formation energy. Charged and neutral density functional formulations have been developed to address this issue, yet their relationship remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate their equivalence in treating the many-body self-interaction of the polaron state. In particular, we connect with each other piecewise-linear functionals based on adding an extra charge to the supercell, the pSIC approach derived from the energetics of the neutral defect with polaronic distortions in a supercell, and the unit-cell method for polarons based on electron-phonon couplings. We show that these approaches lead to the same formal expression of the self-interaction corrected energy, which is fully defined by the energetics of the neutral charge state of the charged polaronic structure. Residual differences between these methods solely arise from the achieved polaronic structure, which is affected by different treatments of electron-screening and finite-size effects. We apply these methods to a set of prototypical small hole and electron polarons, including the hole polaron in MgO, the hole polaron in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, the $V_\text{k}$ center in NaI, the electron polaron in BiVO$_4$, and the electron polaron in TiO$_2$.

            <p>The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and 0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.</p>

            <p>When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer \ce{FeCl2}</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hui Song, Huan-Cheng Yang, Kai Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \ce{FeCl2} monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Time-Reversed Superfluorescence in a Polaronic Quantum Material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati</p>
            <p>Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuumś Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries have emerged as promising platforms for exploring energy storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws. In this work, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model comprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are collectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage capacity.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce a family of new equivalence relations among fusion categories that are less refined than the usual Morita equivalence. We obtain abelian groups by quotienting these new equivalence relations from the commutative monoids of the equivalence classes of all fusion categories. Moreover, we upgrade them to equivalence relations among nondegenerate braided fusion categories that are more refined than the usual Witt equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain new abelian groups that are more refined than the usual Witt group. These new groups allow us to access the internal structures within Witt classes. We expect that they are useful in the classification program of (braided) fusion (higher) categories and in the study of gapless edges of 2+1D topological orders.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Sun, Yiheng Shen, Tengfei Cao, Li-Min Liu</p>
            <p>Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues like high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 9.57 meV/f.u. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moiré patterns, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. The in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization values for HfO2 at twist angles of 21.79°, 27.80°, and 46.83° are 430 (5.82), 367 (2.20), and 1057 (0.03) pC/m, respectively. For 21.79° and 27.80° twisting, switching barriers drop to 1.74 and 0.18 meV/f.u., indicating superlubric-like transitions. Notably, the 46.83° twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.03 meV /f.u.), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moiré-engineered switching route for 2D ferroelectrics.</p>

            <p>Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.</p>

            <h2>Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastian Castorene, Martin HvE Groves, Francisco J. Peña, Eugenio E. Vogel, Patricio Vargas</p>
            <p>Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.</p>

            <p>This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.</p>

            <p>Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be dramatically modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley polarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes STM as a promising tool for exploring edge physics of the rapidly expanding 2D topological phases, including newly realized fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <p>The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.</p>

Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized McMillan formula.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Zhao, Fu Li, Wei Ren, Hao Wang, Hongbin Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.</p>

Here, we report preliminarily experimental advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the realization of an exchange operation.

            <p>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are essential for next-generation, high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet their rational design is hampered by the high computational cost of accurate excited-state predictions. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark study validating semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods -- specifically sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB -- for the high-throughput screening of TADF materials. Using an unprecedentedly large dataset of \num{747} experimentally characterized emitters, our framework demonstrates a computational cost reduction of over \qty{99}{\percent} compared to conventional TD-DFT, while maintaining strong internal consistency between methods (Pearson $r \approx \num{0.82}$ for \deltaest), validating their utility for relative molecular ranking. Validation against \num{312} experimental \deltaest values reveals a mean absolute error of approximately \qty{0.17}{\electronvolt}, a discrepancy attributed to the vertical approximation inherent to the HTS protocol, underscoring the methods' role in screening rather than quantitative prediction. Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key design principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of \qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} for efficient TADF. Principal Component Analysis reveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with three components capturing nearly \qty{90}{\percent} of the variance. This work establishes these semi-empirical methods as powerful, cost-effective tools for accelerating TADF discovery and provides a robust set of data-driven design rules and methodological guidelines for the computational materials science community.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by effective moiré lattice models. While conventional models treat moiré sites as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moiré site is composed of tens to thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological boundary states in moiré materials. Through tight-binding and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moiré site with a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic moiré higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries cut through moiré hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical framework of moiré higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and higher-order superconductivity in moiré platforms.</p>

            <p>The surface effect and quantum confinement render nanomaterials the optoelectronic properties more susceptible to nonradiative processes than their bulk counterparts. These nonradiative processes usually contain a series of interwoven and competing sub-processes, which are challenging to disentangle. Here, we investigate the structural origin of Auger recombination in ZnO nanoparticles using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast electron diffraction. The photogenerated hot holes are captured by oxygen vacancies through an Auger mechanism, inducing significant local structural distortions around the oxygen vacancy and its neighboring zinc tetrahedron on a sub-picosecond timescale. The recombination of trapped holes accelerates the lattice thermalization and stabilizes the formed small hole polarons. Subsequently, the recombination of localized polarons forms a confined exciton-polaron complex that may account for the long-lived (>7 ns) visible luminescence observed in ZnO nanoparticles. Our findings are potentially applicable to other transition metal oxide nanomaterials, bringing insights for the optimization of their functional properties.</p>

First, we explain in detail the characteristic contraction patterns that occur in fPEPS calculations and how to slice them such that peak memory occupation remains minimal while ensuring efficient parallel computation. Second, we combine controlled bond expansion [A. Gleis, J.-W. Li, and J. von Delft, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)] with randomized singular value decomposition [V. Rokhlin, A. Szlam, and M. Tygert, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (2009)] and apply it throughout the fPEPS algorithm. We present benchmark results for the Hubbard model for system sizes up to 8x8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimension of up to D = 6 for PEPS bonds and $\chi$ = 500 for the environment bonds. Finally, we comment on the state and future of the fPEPS-PEPO framework.</p>

            <h2>Strongly Forbidden Thermodynamic Oscillations in Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei G. Lebed</p>
            <p>We theoretically show that strongly forbidden oscillations of a specific heat have to exist in metallic phases of some quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors. They appear due to electron-electron interactions under condition of the magnetic breakdown phenomenon between the so-called open interference electron orbits. We argue that such forbidden thermodynamic oscillations can exist in Q1D conductors (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$, where TMTSF stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, Per is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and mnt is mononitrotoluene, and suggest to discover them.</p>

            <h2>Exposing Altermagnetism through Momentum Density Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenhan Chen, Alyn D. N. James, Stephen B. Dugdale</p>
            <p>Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However, measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet, additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2, CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding the nature of the altermagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Coherent ferrons, the quanta of polarization waves, can potentially be hybridized with many other quasiparticles for achieving novel control modalities in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a new hybridized state resulting from the strong coupling between fundamental-mode (wavenumber is zero) coherent ferrons and cavity bulk acoustic phonons. Using a van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 membrane as an example, we predict an ultra-strong ferron-phonon coupling at room temperature, where the coupling strength g_c reaches over 10% of the resonant frequency {\omega}_0. We also predict an in-situ electric-field-driven bistable control of mode-specific ferron-phonon hybridization via ferroelectric switching. We further show that, CuInP2S6 allows for reaching the fundamentally intriguing but challenging deep strong coupling regime (i.e., g_c/{\omega}_0>1) near the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. Our findings establish the theoretical basis for exploiting coherent ferrons as a new contender for hybrid quantum system with strong and highly tunable coherent coupling.</p>

            <h2>Rheological Behavior of Colloidal Silica Dispersion: Irreversible Aging and Thixotropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Kumar, Yogesh M. Joshi</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the rheological behavior of colloidal dispersion of charge-screened nanoparticles of silica suspended in aqueous media that exhibits soft solid-like consistency. We observe that the system shows various characteristics of physical aging wherein it undergoes time evolution of rheological properties such as elastic modulus, relaxation time, and yield stress subsequent to shear melting of the same. Notably, the relaxation time increases more strongly than linearly with time, which is suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. When considered along with the time-dependent yield stress, this behavior indicates the steady state shear stress-shear rate flow curve to be non-monotonic with a negative slope in a lower shear rate region. Performing shear melting on this system at a later date since the preparation of the dispersion (rest time) results in higher viscosity as well as yield stress, and the corresponding evolution of the elastic modulus shifts to lower times. This implies that physical aging in studied silica dispersion, while reversible over short time scales (of the order of hours), becomes irreversible over longer durations (days) owing to the inability of strong shear to break interparticle bonds that have strengthened over long durations. We also develop a thixotropic structural kinetic model within a time-dependent Maxwell framework that captures the experimentally observed rheological behavior well.</p>

            <h2>Robust structural superlubricity of twisted graphene bilayer and domain walls between commensurate moiré pattern domains from first-principles calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irina V. Lebedeva, Andrey M. Popov, Yulia G. Polynskaya, Andrey A. Knizhnik, Sergey A. Vyrko, Nikolai A. Poklonski</p>
            <p>Twisted graphene layers exhibit extremely low friction for relative sliding. Nevertheless, previous studies suggest that the area contribution to friction for commensurate moiré systems is finite and might restrict macroscopic superlubricity for large layer overlaps. In this paper, we investigate the potential energy surface (PES) for relative displacement of the layers forming moiré patterns (2,1) and (3,1) by accurate density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF3 functional. The amplitudes of PES corrugations on the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are obtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1) pattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that different from aligned graphene layers, for moiré patterns, PES minima and maxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The PES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with and without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation of the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is estimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable physical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode frequency, shear modulus and static friction force. Furthermore, we predict that it should be possible to observe domain walls separating commensurate domains, each comprising a large number of moiré pattern unit cells, and provide estimates of their characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined Hyperferroelectricity, Tunable Multiple Topological Phases and Giant Rashba Effect in Wurtzite LiZnAs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurav Patel, Paras Patel, Shaohui Qiu, Prafulla K. Jha</p>
            <p>Composite quantum compounds offer a fertile ground for uncovering the complex interrelations between seemingly distinct phenomena in condensed matter physics for advanced nonvolatile and spintronics applications. Beyond topological superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations. HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} = 0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants. This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain (BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase (after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV Å and 2.42 eV Å, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.</p>

            <p>Single crystals of $\alpha$-MnTe were synthesized by chemical vapor transport using iodine as the transport reagent. Structural characterization by powder x-ray diffraction confirmed the hexagonal structure (space group P6$_{3}$/mmc). Magnetization $M(T)$ and specific heat $C_p(T)$ measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \approx307$ K. The magnetic entropy derived from the $C_p(T)$ data is consistent with the $S = 5/2$ spin state of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Angle- and field-dependent magnetization measurements indicate complex magnetic responses associated with domains, and show an anomaly around 1 T. These features are analyzed using a phenomenological micromagnetic model that includes higher-order anisotropic exchange interactions coupling the weak ferromagnetic component and the antiferromagnetic order parameter. The model captures the generic behavior of magnetic states and demonstrates that the observed uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropies arise from metastable domain configurations and irreversible magnetization processes.</p>

            <p>Protected states are promising for quantum technologies due to their intrinsic resilience against noise. However, such states often emerge at discrete points or small regions in parameter space and are thus difficult to find in experiments. In this work, we present a machine-learning method for tuning to protected regimes, based on injecting noise into the system and searching directly for the most noise-resilient configuration. We illustrate this method by considering short quantum dot-based Kitaev chains which we subject to random parameter fluctuations. Using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy we minimize the typical resulting ground state splitting, which makes the system converge to a protected configuration with well-separated Majorana bound states. We verify the robustness of our method by considering finite Zeeman fields, electron-electron repulsion, asymmetric couplings, and varying the length of the Kitaev chain. Our work provides a reliable method for tuning to protected states, including but not limited to isolated Majorana bound states.</p>

            <p>Frequency combs represent a hallmark of coherence emerging from nonlinear dynamics, where periodic driving organizes energy into a precisely spaced spectral structure. Extending this concept to collective excitations in solids such as magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials, offers a powerful route to control energy flow, coherence, and information processing in condensed matter systems. Here, we demonstrate deterministic control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs in magnetic vortices using nanosecond voltage pulses. By tuning the pulse duration and timing, we control the nonlinear energy transfer between magnons and the vortex core, enabling the Floquet-engineered initiation or suppression of magnon frequency combs far below their spontaneous instability threshold. This pulse-programmable interaction allows the vortex to sustain magnon-driven auto-oscillation with high phase stability, or to revert to its static ground state on demand. Our results establish vortex-based magnetic systems as a robust solid-state platform for Floquet engineering, bridging nonlinear spin dynamics with frequency conversion and coherent spin-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Fei Huang, Houssam Sabri, Jiadong Zang, Jie-Xiang Yu</p>
            <p>Strong coupling among spontaneous structural symmetric breaking, magnetism and metallicity in an intrinsic polar magnetic metal can give rise to novel physical phenomena and holds great promise for applications in spintronics. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of metallic ferroelectricity in the recently discovered polar metal Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our first-principles calculations reveal that both the spontaneous ferroelectric displacements and the metallicity originate from charge disproportionation of Co ions. This is characterized by an inverted ligand-field splitting of the Co $t_2g$ orbitals at one site, while the metallic behavior is preserved by the t$_2g$ orbitals at both sites. The charge disproportionation stabilizes the asymmetric phase Within the framework of the on-site Hubbard U interaction. We thus propose that in related transition metal oxides, charge disproportionation within specific orbitals can concurrently drive metallicity and ferroelectricity, enabling strong coupling between these properties. More remarkably, this mechanism allows for the coexistence of magnetism, as evidenced in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our findings highlight a promising avenue for realizing polar magnetic metals and provide a new design principle for exploring multifunctional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manon Bourgade, Nicolas Bain, Loïc Vanel, Mathieu Leocmach, Catherine Barentin</p>
            <p>Forcing hydrophilic fluids through hydrophobic porous solids is a recurrent industrial challenge. If the penetrating fluid is Newtonian, the imposed pressure has to overcome the capillary pressure at the fluid-air interface in a pore. The presence of a yield-stress, however, makes the pressure transfer and the penetration significantly more complex. In this study, we experimentally investigate the forced penetration of a water based yield-stress fluid through a regular hydrophobic mesh under quasi-static conditions, combining quantitative pressure measurements and direct visualisation of the penetration process. We reveal that the penetration is controlled by a competition between the yield-stress and two distinct pressures. The capillary pressure, that dictates the threshold at which the yield-stress fluid penetrates the hydrophobic mesh, and a priming pressure, that controls how the fluid advances through it. The latter corresponds to a pressure drop ensuing a local capillary instability, never reported before. Our findings shine a new light on forced imbibition processes, with direct implications on their fundamental understanding and practical engineering.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled networks of metallic nanowires (NWs) are being intensively explored as test benches for neuromorphic proposals. In this work, we study the electric transport properties of dense self-assembled networks of Ag-based NWs (AgNWNs) coated with a thin insulating layer, using DC and AC stimuli. The building blocks of this network are the metallic NWs and the NW-NW junctions, either metallic or memristive. In the pristine state, frequency independence of the impedance reveals an over-percolated purely resistive network. A combination of low-temperature annealing and AC stimulus is shown to drastically affect the resistivity of the sample (interpreted as a depopulation of purely metallic junctions), unveiling a rich dynamic response. This procedure triggers the achievement of a capacitive response, which is successfully rationalized using a previously introduced 'two junction model'. Thermal treatment appears to be an indirect strategy to effectively modify the humidity content at the NW-NW intersections and, consequently, enable multiple switching schemes suitable for brain-like processing alternatives.</p>

While both take the universal values $G_V({\omega = 0}) = e^2/h$ and $S_V(\omega = 0) = 4 e^2 k_{\rm B} T/h$ in the zero-frequency limit, $G_V(\omega)$ and $S_V(\omega)$ are quickly suppressed for finite $\omega$, so that low-frequency transport is effectively noiseless.</p>

            <p>Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products. A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm) exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300 nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections arising from ion milling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanka Ghosh, Andreas M. Menzel</p>
            <p>When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider the basic example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes. One does not necessarily need to adjust the material parameters and thus materials themselves. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic level using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. Small deviations from linear elasticity theory can be minimized by tuning the hole-to-system size ratio in the molecular dynamics simulations. This extension attests the robustness of our continuum predictions even at atomistic scales. The basic concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</p>

            <p>Parametrized measures (or Young measures) enable to reformulate non-convex variational problems as convex problems at the cost of enlarging the search space from space of functions to space of measures. To benefit from such machinery, we need powerful tools for approximating measures. We develop a deep neural network approximation of Young measures in this paper. The key idea is to write the Young measure as push-forward of Gaussian mea- sures, and reformulate the problem of finding Young measures to finding the corresponding push-forward. We approximate the push-forward map us- ing deep neural networks by encoding the reformulated variational problem in the loss function. After developing the framework, we demonstrate the approach in several numerical examples. We hope this framework and our illustrative computational experiments provide a pathway for approximating Young measures in their wide range of applications from modeling complex microstructure in materials to non-cooperative games.</p>

            <p>Focused ion beams (FIBs) are widely used in nanofabrication for applications such as circuit repair, ultra-thin lamella preparation, strain engineering, and quantum device prototyping. Although the lateral spread of the ion beam is often overlooked, it becomes critical in precision tasks such as impurity placement in host substrates, where accurate knowledge of the ion-matter interaction profile is essential. Existing techniques typically characterise only the beam core, where most ions land, thus underestimating the full extent of the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns were collected in calibration regions with known ion fluence and compared to patterns acquired around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam for 1-10 s. Cross-correlation using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artefacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This approach is complementary to image resolution methods enabling a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance and supporting application tailoring beyond the conventional resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.</p>

Typically, this coefficient is complicated and highly dependent on its details. In this work, we introduce a new perspective based on the notion of a ``phantom current''. We have shown that a spin-2 phantom current arising from the folding trick completely determines the transmission coefficient. In particular, when there is a single phantom current, the transmission coefficient is uniquely fixed by its conformal dimension. As a result, our framework provides a unified explanation of known results in minimal models and the free boson, while also yielding concrete predictions for previously unexplored interfaces.</p>

Specifically, we impose a selection rule motivated by Kramers-Wannier duality and derive bounds on the conformal dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon)$ of the lowest-lying $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd scalar $\sigma$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even scalar $\epsilon$ in dimensions $d=2$ through $d=7$. Our bounds correctly allow the $d=2$ Ising model while excluding the $d=3$ Ising model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed condition. Furthermore, we observe a distinct feature in $d=2$ corresponding to the $\mathcal{M}(8,7)$ minimal model and find non-trivial constraints in $d=3$ ($\Delta_\sigma \gtrsim 0.85$), relevant for theories like QED$_3$.

            <p>The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to a localized fermionic source in the presence of bulk dephasing. We consider two classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile $n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$ in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix. For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation platforms.</p>

These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.</p>

            <p>We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Bone serves as a remarkable example of nature's architectured material with its unique blend of strength and toughness, all at a lightweight design. Given the hierarchical nature of these materials, it is essential to understand the governing mechanisms and organization of its constituents across length scales for bio-inspired structural design. Despite recent advances in transmission electron miscoscopy (TEM) that have allowed us to witness the fascinating arrangement of bone at micro- down to the nano-scale, we are still missing the details about the structural organization and mechanical properties of the main building blocks of bone - mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs). Here, we propose a novel approach for extracting individual MCFs from nature's model material via a dropcasting procedure. By isolating the MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, we visualized the arrangement of organic and mineral phases within the individual MCFs at the nanoscale. Using a 4D-STEM approach, the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs was examined. Furthermore, we conducted first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments, revealing exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs. The capabilities of TEM allow us to resolve MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale level. This new knowledge of the ultrastructure of the bone-building blocks and the proposed sample extraction and in situ mechanical testing opens up new avenues for research into nature's inspired material design.</p>

            <h2>Large deviations of spectral determinants of matrix-valued random Schrödinger operators and Dyson Brownian motion in cubic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Fyodorov, Pierre Le Doussal, Alexander Ossipov</p>
            <p>We study the moments of $\overline{|\det(H-E)|^q}$ and the associated large deviations of $\log |\det(H-E)|$ where $H$ are random matrix operators involving Laplace operators and random potentials. This includes as a special case Hessians of random elastic manifolds at a generic energy configuration. In one dimension $d=1$ these are $N \times N$ matrix valued random Schrödinger operators and $\log | \det(H-E) | $ is the sum of the $N$ associated Lyapunov exponents. Using a mapping to a stochastic matrix Ricatti equation we make a connection between the spectral properties of these operators and the total $N$ particle current of a Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) in a cubic potential. The latter model was studied by Allez and Dumaz [1] who showed that for $N=+\infty$ it exhibits a sharp transition between a phase with non-zero current and a confined (zero current) phase. We compute the barrier-crossing probability of the DBM at large but finite $N$, which gives an estimate of the exponential tail of the average density of states of a matrix Schrodinger operator below the edge of its spectrum. The barrier behaves as $\sim N (-E)^{3/2}$ at large negative energy and vanishes as $\sim N(E^*-E)^{5/4}$ near the edge. For $q=1$ the present work provides an independent derivation of the total complexity of stationary points for an elastic string embedded in $N$ dimension in presence of disorder.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing offers a potential solution to the complexity of superconducting chip hardware layouts and error correction algorithms. High-quality gates between distributed chips enable the simplification of existing error correction algorithms. This article proposes and demonstrates a remote quantum geometric gate scheme via parametric modulation. Our scheme inherits the intrinsic robustness of geometric phases. Meanwhile, by employing gradient-based optimization algorithms(Adaptive Moment Estimation) from deep learning, we design control waveforms that significantly suppress population leakage. We experimentally realize the rapid remote SWAP and $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates with high fidelity, completing operation in about 30 ns. The gate error of SWAP ($\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$) is 1.16\% (0.91\%) after excluding the effect of energy relaxation. The simulation demonstrate that this scheme can be implemented in the distributed chips connected by cables extending several meters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in enabling modular quantum processors, offering a promising path toward the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

The update briefly summarizes some notable results on this topic that have been reported very recently, and offers a compact outline of the directions of the current experiment and theoretical work in this and related fields.

            <h2>2D or not 2D: a "holographic dictionary'' for Lowest Landau Levels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Mandal, Ajay Mohan, Rushikesh Suroshe</p>
            <p>We consider 2D fermions on a plane with a perpendicular magnetic field, described by Landau levels. It is wellknown that, semiclassically, restriction to the lowest Landau levels (LLL) implies two constraints on a 4D phase space, that transforms the 2D coordinate space (x,y) into a 2D phase space, thanks to the non-zero Dirac bracket between x and y. A naive application of Dirac's prescription of quantizing LLL in terms of L2 functions of x (or of y) fails because the wavefunctions are functions of x and y. We are able, however, to construct a 1D QM, sitting differently inside the 2D QM, which describes the LLL physics. The construction includes an exact 1D-2D correspondence between the fermion density \rho(x,y) and the Wigner distribution of the 1D QM. In a suitable large N limit, (a) the Wigner distribution is upper bounded by 1, since a phase space cell can have at most one fermion (Pauli exclusion principle) and (b) the 1D-2D correspondence becomes an identity transformation. (a) and (b) imply an upper bound for the fermion density \rho(x,y). We also explore the entanglement entropy (EE) of subregions of the 2D noncommutative space. It behaves differently from conventional 2D systems as well as conventional 1D systems, falling somewhere between the two. The main new feature of the EE, directly attributable to the noncommutative space, is the absence of a logarithmic dependence on the size of the entangling region, even though there is a Fermi surface. In this paper, instead of working directly with the Landau problem, we consider a more general problem, of 2D fermions in a rotating harmonic trap, which reduces to the Landau problem in a special limit. Among other consequences of the emergent 1D physics, we find that post-quench dynamics of the (generalized) LLL system is computed more simply in 1D terms, which is described by well-developed methods of 2D phase space hydrodynamics.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. In this Letter we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of self-organized nano-systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. This universal bound can be saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients. When long-range correlations are present, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies bio-mimetic principles for the self-assembly of synthetic nanosystems and rationalizes, on purely information-theoretic grounds, why scale separation and hierarchical structures are common motifs in biology.</p>

            <p>Computational materials discovery relies on the generation of plausible crystal structures. The plausibility is typically judged through density functional theory methods which, while typically accurate at zero Kelvin, often favor low-energy structures that are not experimentally accessible. We develop a combined compositional and structural synthesizability score which provides an accurate way of predicting which compounds can actually be synthesized in a laboratory. We use it to evaluate non-synthesized structures from the Materials Project, GNoME, and Alexandria, and identified several hundred highly synthesizable candidates. We then predict synthesis pathways, conduct corresponding experiments, and characterize the products across 16 targets, successfully synthesizing 7 of 16. The entire experimental process was completed in only three days. Our results highlight omissions in lists of known synthesized structures, deliver insights into the practical utility of current materials databases, and showcase the central role synthesizability prediction can play in materials discovery.</p>

            <p>Extreme pressures and temperatures create conditions that allow even hard and brittle materials to deform plastically. Despite extensive research, the upper limits of flow strength, the resistance to plastic flow, remain uncertain, and the mechanisms driving deformation at the relevant stresses are a subject of debate. Using femtosecond in situ X-ray diffraction experiments and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that stacking fault-mediated strengthening enables shock-compressed nano-polycrystalline diamond to achieve a peak flow strength of 107+-5 GPa at a stress of 227+-8 GPa. Our findings show that extreme conditions can unlock unusual strength via mechanisms that can be used as design tools in targeted applications.</p>

            <p>A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter exhibiting the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. Theory predicts that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can form supersolid phases at half filling and near complete filling. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ degrees of freedom, we investigate these phases in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet \K212 with exchange constants $J_z = 2.96(2)$~meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$~meV. At zero field, neutron diffraction reveals the gradual development for $T<15$~K of quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with $Z_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) albeit with 44(5)% reduced amplitude at $T=0.3$~K indicating strong quantum fluctuations. These are apparent in equidistant bands of continuum neutron scattering for $\hslash\omega_n\approx n\times J_z$, where $n=0,1,2,3$. The lowest energy ($n=0$) $\bf Q$-dependent continuum has a lower resonant edge and includes a quasi-elastic component at K $(\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{3})$ consistent with broken $U(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (boson superfluidity). Competing instabilities are apparent in soft albeit finite-energy modes at M $(\frac{1}{2}0)$ and at $\frac{1}{2}$K $(\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{6})$. For $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields $17~{\rm T} <\mu_0 H< 21~{\rm T}$ that almost saturate the magnetization, corresponding to nearly filling the lattice with bosons, we find a new phase consistent with a second supersolid. These phases are separated by a pronounced 1/3 magnetization plateau that supports coherent spin waves, from which we determine the spin Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Leonardo Biagetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that entanglement and confinement hole pairing (ECHP) is a precise physics of the entanglement framework of the RVB theory of high-Tc cuprates. Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the entire phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of the spin gap and strange metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of the overdoped regions of the superconducting (SC) dome, the presence of the parallel superconducting stripes in the CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and the linear-T behavior of the strange metal phase above the overdoped regions of the SC dome. This also explains the experimental spin textures of the cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement and confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we were able to provide a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the entire phase diagram, thus providing the sought-after mechanism responsible for the entire phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates</p>

A comprehensive analysis of the data suggests that the observed anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in TiSe$_2$ flakes is most likely caused by the three-dimensional weak localization effect.

            <h2>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Jonas Moser, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</p>

            <p>Flat electronic bands strongly enhance Coulomb interactions and can stabilize unconventional insulating states. Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature. Bright excitons appear at $0.94$~eV and $1.21$~eV, with ultra-large binding energies of $2.05$~eV and $1.77$~eV. By mapping the low-energy dynamics onto a spin-1 Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, we show that frustrated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric tendencies naturally emerge. These results identify Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as a candidate multiferroic dark excitonic insulator, opening a pathway to correlated quantum phases in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into alternative thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser-irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite-element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahil N. Valani, David M. Paganin</p>
            <p>Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of inertial active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and wave memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have previously been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. Inspired by the rich dynamics of strongly interacting superwalking droplets in experiments, we numerically investigate the dynamics of WPE clusters using a stroboscopic model. We find that several interacting WPEs self-organize into a stable bound cluster, reminiscent of an atomic nucleus. This active cluster exhibits a rich spectrum of collective excitations, including shape oscillations and chiral rotating modes, akin to vibrational and rotational modes of nuclear excitations, as the spatial extent of the waves and their temporal decay rate (memory) are varied. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective wave field potential, bearing qualitative similarities with the nuclear shell model and the bag model of hadrons. For high memory and rapid spatial decay of waves, the active cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates; however, within a narrow regime of the parameter space, the cluster ejects single particles whose decay statistics follow exponential laws, reminiscent of radioactive nuclear decay. Our study uncovers a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors in clusters of active particles, opening new avenues for exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in active matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Is Herbertsmithite far from an ideal antiferromagnet? Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flaurent Heully-Alary, Nadia Ben Amor, Nicolas Suaud, Laura Messio, Coen de Graaf, Nathalie Guihéry</p>
            <p>Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagomé lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the Kagomé magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.</p>

            <p>We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</p>

            <h2>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</h2>

            <p>Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent advances in ultracold atomic gas experiments, we investigate a two-terminal mesoscopic system in which two-body loss occurs locally at the center of a one-dimensional chain. By means of the self-consistent Born approximation in the Keldysh formalism, we uncover mesoscopic current formulas that are experimentally relevant and applicable to the weak dissipation regime. Although these formulas are analogous to those for systems with one-body loss, it turns out that the channel transmittance and loss probability depend on the nonequilibrium occupation at the lossy site. We demonstrate that this occupation dependence leads to a weaker suppression of currents in the presence of two-body loss compared to one-body loss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacques K. Desmarais, Kamel Bencheikh, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis</p>
            <p>The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</p>

            <h2>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanket Kumawat, Mohit Sharma, Ujjwal Kumar Nandi, Indrajit Tah, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</p>

            <h2>Learning the non-Markovian features of subsystem dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Coppola, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Zala Lenarčič</p>
            <p>The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</p>

            <h2>When and How Ultrasound Enhances Nanoparticle Diffusion in Hydrogels: A Stick-and-Release Mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo M. Blanco, Hedda H. Rønneberg, Rita S. Dias</p>
            <p>Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as drug carriers in cancer therapy due to their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their transport within tumors is often hindered by the dense extracellular matrix, where diffusion dominates. Several studies suggest that ultrasound (US) irradiation can enhance NP diffusion in ECM-mimicking hydrogels, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and experimental findings are often contradictory. Here, we use coarse-grained Langevin Dynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which US can enhance NP diffusion in hydrogels. After validating our simulation framework against an exact analytical solution for NP motion under US in dilute buffer, we systematically explore NP diffusion in hydrogels with varying degrees of NP-network attraction. Our results reveal that acoustic enhancement arises from reduced contact time between NPs and the hydrogel matrix. This effect becomes significant only when NP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough to disrupt these interactions, following a "stick-and-release" mechanism. These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and explain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others. Overall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP diffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing therapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications.</p>

            <h2>Nonextensive Thermodynamics of the Morse Oscillator: Signature and Solid State Application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpita Goswami</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a bound quantum system: the Morse oscillator within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \( q \). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \( q < 1 \). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Xin Lin, Hsiu-Chuan Hsu</p>
            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents. In contrast, circularly polarized light can not induce shift or injection currents, as constrained by the three-fold rotation symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is shown in the Haldane model. Under linearly polarized light, shift current, allowed by time-reversal symmetry, flows perpendicularly to the injection current, allowed by $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign since the group velocity's sign remains unchanged. On the contrary, shift current shows a sign flip, as a result of band inversion. Furthermore, we calculate quantum geometry, including quantum metric and symplectic connection, to demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE. We found that the vector field of symplectic connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase.</p>

            <p>Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</p>

NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate effectively in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.</p>

            <p>Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature. Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its topological electronic Dirac states that account for both high Fermi velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of metallic materials.</p>

            <p>We study a binary Bose gas in a symmetric dual-core, pancake-shaped trap, modelled by two linearly coupled two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Two different cases are considered. First, we consider a spatially uniform condensate, where we identify the domains of parameters for macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping and localisation revivals. The analytical formulas for the Josephson frequencies in the zero- and $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the system displays a rich bifurcation structure. In the zero-phase, two successive pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase exhibits a single pitchfork bifurcation. The second case is when the quantum droplets are in a dual-core trap. Analytical predictions for the oscillation frequencies are derived via a variational approach for the coupled dynamics of quantum droplets, and direct numerical simulations validate the results. We identify critical values of the linear coupling that separate Josephson and self-trapped regimes as the particle number changes. We also found the Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag effect in numerical simulations of the droplet-droplet interactions in the two-core geometry.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, despite reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along this line, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be the goal? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), offers an effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.</p>

            <p>Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.</p>

            <p>We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengrong Guo</p>
            <p>The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are dictated by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The absence of a predictive theory directly linking catalysts to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here we narrow this gap through a two-step approach. First, we derive a universal vector sum rule that quantifies the relationship between cap structure and chirality, demonstrating that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the vector sum of the six pentagon coordinates within the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. Building on this topological foundation, we establish that chirality is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as perturbations to pentagon positions lead to predictable, quantifiable, and kinetically irreversible shifts in (n,m). By examining existing experimental evidence, we further propose that the preferential formation of $(12,6)$ nanotubes arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the <1,1,1> catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meghraj Prajapat, Alankar Alankar</p>
            <p>Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.</p>

            <h2>Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Chatterjee</p>
            <p>While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</p>

            <p>A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Yong Ge, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disordered-ordered phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the accessibility of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.</p>

We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</p>

            <p>Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.</p>

            <p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p>

            <p>Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the Universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</p>

            <h2>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p>

            <p>The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the previously studied dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time performs a generalization of the multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated at the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models as well as $c=1$ models on a random surface. It is noted that some of these models can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.</p>

This unusual coexistence of universal and variable exponents offers a rare empirical testbed for nonequilibrium growth and an empirical basis for modeling urban sprawl.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical FP time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</p>

            <p>The preparation procedures of materials are often embedded narratively in experimental protocols, research articles, patents, and laboratory notes, and are structured around procedural sequences, causal relationships, and conditional logic. The synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer composites exemplifies this linguistically encoded decision-making system, where the practical experiments involve interdependent multistage and path-dependent processes such as exfoliation, functionalization, and dispersion, each governed by heterogeneous parameters and contextual contingencies, challenging conventional numerical optimization paradigms for experiment design. We reformulate this challenge into a text-reasoning problem through a framework centered on a text-first, lightly structured materials database and large language models (LLMs) as text reasoning engines. We constructed a database that captures evidence-linked narrative excerpts from the literature while normalizing only the minimum necessary entities, attributes, and relations to enable composite retrieval that unifies semantic matching, lexical cues, and explicit value filters. Building on this language-native, provenance-preserving foundation, the LLM operates in two complementary modes: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), grounding outputs in retrieved evidence modules from the database, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which leverages iteratively trained text guides derived from multi-source literature-based narrative data as external references to inform reasoning and decision-making. Applying this integration-and-reasoning framework, we demonstrate rapid, laboratory-scale optimization of BNNS preparation, highlighting how language-native data combined with LLM-based reasoning can significantly accelerate practical material preparation.</p>

            <p>We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. Our strategy is to write the latter as $E_{GS}(N_m)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ \chi:=E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. Conformal perturbation theory predicts that around a CFT, $\chi= \chi_{\rm min} + \sum_i \lambda_i^2 N_m^{-\omega_i} + O(\lambda^3)$, where $\lambda_i$ are the couplings associated to perturbations of operators with dimension $\Delta_i$, and $\omega_i = d-\Delta_i$. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] and their sweet spot with good precision. Varying two coupling constants allows us to extract the correction-to-scaling exponent $\omega$ associated to the two leading scalars $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$ instead of $E_0$.</p>

            <p>We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant. Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference, remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response, quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as epsilon-near-zero materials.</p>

The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system, hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

            <p>We present a theoretical framework for investigating superconducting proximity effect in altermagnet (AM)-superconductor (SC) heterostructures. In general, AMs, characterized by vanishing net magnetization but spin-split electronic spectra, provide a promising platform for realizing unconventional magnetic phases. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave AM proximity coupled to a three dimensional ordinary $s$-wave SC. By integrating out the superconducting degrees of freedom, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that describes the proximity-induced modifications in the AM layer in the form of a self-energy. We then derive an effective Green's function to obtain the proximity-induced pairing amplitudes in the AM layer and classify the induced pairing amplitudes according to their parity, frequency, and spin. We find the presence of even-parity singlet and triplet pairing amplitudes in the AM layer. To achieve the odd-parity triplet components, important to realize topological superconductivity, we introduce a layer of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in the heterostructure. We analyse the band topology of this proximity-induced AM-RSOC layer and demonstrate the emergence of both weak and strong topological superconducting phases with edge-localized modes, characterized by winding number and Chern number. These findings highlight the role of AM-SC hybrid setup as a versatile platform for realizing odd-parity triplet pairings and engineering topological superconductivity in two-dimension.</p>

            <p>Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</p>

            <h2>The microscopic origin of the Quantum Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenio DelRe, Paolo Di Porto</p>
            <p>Topology is key in describing unconventional quantum phases of matter and devising robust quantum technology. Exactly how topology mixes with quantum mechanics remains largely unclear, as testified by the lack of a unifying microscopic theory for the ever-expanding and still puzzling transport behavior of electrons in the Quantum Hall Effect. Here we formulate a microscopic theory able to quantitatively describe the large wealth of Quantum Hall physics starting from one basic assumption, that the topological constraint in actual space leads to a superposition of states in the associated angular space. This allows us to identify the mechanism underlying quantum topology, single-particle wavefunction regularity in 3D, while many-body physics and disorder play no fundamental role. Our findings introduce a new far-reaching perspective in analyzing topological quantum systems and applications, such as topological quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Topological Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetic Correlated Insulators in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuyi Tuo, Ming-Rui Li, Zhengzhi Wu, Wen Sun, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers at filling $\nu=-1$, considerable interest has arisen in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model. Incorporating both onsite Hubbard repulsion and next-nearest-neighbor attraction, we then performed a mean-field analysis of the microscopic model and obtained a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. For zero or weak displacement field, the ground state is a Chern number $C=\pm 2$ topological superconductor in the Altland-Zirnbauer A-class (breaking time-reversal but preserving total $S_z$ symmetry) with inter-valley pairing dominant in $d_{xy}\pm id_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (mixing with a subdominant $p_x\mp i p_y$-wave) component. For a relatively strong displacement field, the ground state is a correlated insulator with the $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the twisted WSe$_2$ systems and suggest the need for further theoretical and experimental explorations.</p>

            <h2>Elastic Response and Instabilities of Anomalous Hall Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Desrochers, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Joe Huxford, Adarsh S. Patri, T. Senthil, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs) are exotic phases of matter that simultaneously break continuous translation symmetry and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. AHCs have recently been proposed as an explanation for the observation of an integer quantum anomalous Hall phase in a multilayer graphene system. Despite intense theoretical and experimental interest, little is known about the mechanical properties of AHCs. We study the elastic properties of AHCs, first by utilizing a continuum model with a quadratic dispersion and uniform Berry curvature. We find using time-dependent Hartree-Fock that the stiffness of the AHC is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the WC, which we attribute to the finite Chern number of the AHC preventing exponential localization of the charge density. By modifying the dispersion relation to include a local minimum modeled after that of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (R5G), we find that deformations away from the triangular lattice minimize the kinetic energy of the AHC, which overwhelms the small stiffness and generates a mechanical instability. Using a microscopic model of R5G, we observe a similar mechanical instability over an experimentally relevant parameter regime. We conclude that the topologically limited stiffness of AHCs makes them susceptible to mechanical instabilities, an important consideration when interpreting experiments in terms of AHCs.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Goto, Kentaro Kuga, Kiyohisa Tanaka, Tsunehiro Takeuchi, Masaharu Matsunami</p>
            <p>In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, utilizing energy-dependent electron-scattering beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also future perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <h2>Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makayla R. Branham-Ferrari, Shinian Cheng, Alexei P. Sokolov, David S. Simmons</p>
            <p>Since their discovery in 2011, vitrimers - covalent associative network polymers - have challenged the traditional understanding of soft matter relaxation dynamics: unlike in typical glass-forming liquids, vitrimers' viscous relaxation can be entirely decoupled from their underlying structural (segmental) dynamics. Beyond this fundamental mystery, the origin of vitrimers' Arrhenius viscosity in the presence of super-Arrhenius structural relaxation behavior has been of high interest due to vitrimers' potential to provide readily reprocessable high-performance plastics. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to establish a foundational understanding of vitrimer relaxation dynamics. We identify two types of transient networks based on the ratio of atomic displacement scales required for bond exchange to those required to relax a segment. In systems where bond exchange only requires sub-segmental motion, we show that network relaxation is governed by a competition between chemical exchange reactions and segmental diffusion. This competition produces vitrimers' signature network/segment decoupling, while also driving a crossover between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius behavior that is observed for many vitrimers. This work provides an explanation for longstanding puzzling features of vitrimer dynamics and establishes a foundation for rational vitrimer design.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of the disorder operator at (3+1)D O(3) quantum criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuyang Liang, Xiao-Chuan Wu, Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>The disorder operator, as an easily measured non-local observable, displays great potential in detecting intrinsic information of field theories. It has been systematically studied in 1d and 2d quantum systems, while the knowledge of 3d is still limited. The disorder operator associated with U(1) global symmetry exhibits rich geometric dependence on the shape of the spatial region at a quantum critical point, meanwhile, (3+1)D is the upper critical dimension for O(N) criticalities, both of which pose a challenge for exploring the disorder operator in high dimensions. In this work, we investigate the scaling behaviors of disorder operators in (3+1)D O(3) models through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation combined with theoretical analysis. The universal contributions, such as the current central charge, have been revealed in our calculation, which establishes a concrete link between lattice simulations and continuum field theory. This work opens new avenues for experimental and numerical exploration of universal properties at quantum critical points in (3+1)D models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinchao Zhao, Peizhi Mai, Gaurav Tenkila, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the Mott transition exhibits universal scaling as a consequence of the breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in momentum space. A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\alpha$ where $\alpha\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots, even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to sparse array encodings of any size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Bai, Mao Tian Tan, Bastien Lapierre, Shinsei Ryu</p>
            <p>We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "Möbius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.</p>

            <p>We report high resolution polar Kerr effect measurements on CsV3Sb5 and ScV6Sn6 single crystals in search for signatures of spontaneous polar Kerr effect (PKE) below the charge order transitions of these materials. Utilizing two separate zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550 nm and 830 nm wavelengths, we studied the temperature dependence of possible PKE after training with magnetic field. While a finite field Kerr measurement yielded optical rotation expected from the Pauli susceptibility of the itinerant carriers, no signal was detected at zero-field to within the noise floor limit of the apparatus of below $\sim$100 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent reflection measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in the same optical volume as the Kerr measurements. Application of strain to reveal a hidden flux-ordered magnetic state did not result in a finite Kerr effect.</p>

            <p>We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering, indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps, driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies, promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on ultrafast timescales.</p>

            <h2>Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Wu, Seamus D. O Hara, Joseph B. Costello, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Mark S. Sherwin</p>
            <p>Effective Hamiltonians are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems. Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian directly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship between Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are known from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of GaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an additional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave interferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian reconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\,meV higher than the expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic analysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could have been renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by the strong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of optical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</p>

In this work, we measured the SC gap in high-quality single crystal of \beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC gaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference between the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about 0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and quantitative experimental results support the possibility of \beta-PdBi2 as a topological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pushpendra Yadav</p>
            <p>The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. In equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The electrocaloric (EC) effect offers a promising energy-efficient and clean cooling technology. We present the first direct measurements of EC temperature change in a new family of EC fluids, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLCs), demonstrating in two such materials temperature jumps of $|{\Delta}T_j|$ ~ 0.2 K for field changes as low as ${\Delta}E$ ~ 0.1 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$. Indirect measurements of adiabatic temperature change $|{\Delta}T|$ confirm that these direct measurements are an underestimate and that ${\Delta}E$ = 2 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$ can induce up to $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1.6 K, yielding EC strengths $|{\Delta}T/{\Delta}E|$ up to 100% higher than incumbent materials. For temperature spans of 5-10 K, we predict a coefficient of performance of ~21-40. We find $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1 K for >100 FNLCs that collectively span all temperatures between $0{^\circ}$C and $100{^\circ}$C. This, together with the new device concepts conceivable with fluid EC materials, offers huge potential for cooling applications.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the bi-isotropic effects in the formation and tunability of hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations. We consider a heterostructure composed of a medium with bi-isotropic constitutive relations and an AFM layer. Using the transfer matrix formalism, we derive general expressions for the dispersion relations of surface polaritonic modes, including the dependence on the bi-isotropic parameter, and analyze their coupling to bulk magnon-polaritons. As an illustration of application, we consider a heterostructure formed with Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ interfaced with antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials that support terahertz-frequency magnons, specifically Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and FeF$_{2}$. In the strong bi-isotropic coupling regime, the surface Dirac plasmon--phonon--magnon polariton (DPPMP) dispersion undergoes a pronounced redshift, accompanied by suppression of the characteristic anticrossing between the Dirac plasmon and the phonon. This effect, observed in all AFM materials considered, suggests a weakening of the hybrid interaction, possibly due to saturation or detuning mechanisms induced by increased $\alpha$. Furthermore, increasing the Fermi energy of the topological insulator enhances the surface plasmon and phonon contributions, inducing a blueshift of the DPPP branches and bringing them closer to resonance with the magnon mode, thereby increasing the hybridization strength. Intriguingly, this redshift partially compensates the blueshift induced by a higher Fermi level, restoring the system to a weak-coupling regime analogous to that observed at lower Fermi energies. Our findings reveal that both the Fermi level and the bi-isotropic response offer independent and complementary control parameters for tuning the strength of light--magnon coupling in TI/AFM heterostructures, with potential implications for reconfigurable THz spintronic and photonic devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries, focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures: $T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} > T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry. Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary, negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity. These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.</p>

            <p>The magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ has been under intense debate. Using first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001] direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on (100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.</p>

Recent time-resolved spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

Here, we propose a microscopic lattice model with a nematic superconducting ground state and show that it supports a rich set of vestigial phases at elevated temperature, including a charge-$4e$ phase and a quasi-long-range nematic phase, by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Combining theoretical analysis with Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover the nature of these phases and show that the phase transitions are governed by the proliferation of distinct topological defects: half superconducting vortices, $(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})$ vortices, integer nematic vortices, and domain-wall excitations. In particular, we demonstrate that domain-wall proliferation is crucial for the quasi-nematic phase and should be carefully accounted for in phase transitions associated with vestigial charge-$4e$ order.</p>

            <h2>Role of Phase Fluctuation in Dynamic Competition Between Charge Order and Superconductivity in Cuprates</h2>

            <p>Phase fluctuations are a key factor distinguishing nonthermal (ultrafast) and thermal phase transitions. Charge order in cuprates is characterized by short-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it provides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in coupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite heterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work underscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic competition between order parameters in cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Spin Polarons in Flat Band Ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Rahul Sahay, Stefan Divic, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above spin polarized electronic this http URL bound states conventionally form in one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.</p>

            <h2>Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Meyniel, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e. $\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a $T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a $T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or superconductors studied previously.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a transformative technology for probing magnetic phase transition1-4, evidencing Meissner effect of superconductors1,5-9, and visualizing stress distribution3,9 under extreme conditions. Recent development in NV configurations and hydrostatic environments have raised the operational pressures of NV centers to 140 GPa2,6,10,11, but substantial challenges remain in extending sensing capabilities into multi-megabar range, critical for research in hydrogen-rich superconductors like La-Sc-H ($T_{\text{c}}$ of 271-298 K at 195-266 GPa)12 and evolution of minerals near Earth's core13. Here we report the fabrication of shallow NV centers through ion implantation followed by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing, leading to increased density, improved coherence, and mitigated internal stresses, a pre-requisite for reducing their degradation under compression. This NV magnetometry enable breakthrough of pressure capabilities exceeding 240 GPa, constrained by structural integrity of the 50 um diamond anvils, suggesting that the untapped pressure limit may enable further advancements with smaller cutlets or more robust diamonds. We present compelling evidence of the Meissner effect and trapped flux at record-high pressure of 180 GPa for superconducting transition in elemental titanium (Ti) as benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for high-pressure magnetometry in exploring complex quantum phenomena at previously unreachable pressures.</p>

            <p>We study nonstabilizerness on the information lattice, and demonstrate that noninteger local information directly indicates nonstabilizerness. For states with a clear separation of short- and large-scale information, noninteger total information at large scales $\Gamma$ serves as a witness of long-range nonstabilizerness. We propose a folding procedure to separate the global and edge-to-edge contributions to $\Gamma$. As an example we show that the ferromagnetic ground state of the spin-1/2 three-state Potts model has long-range nonstabilizerness originating from global correlations, while the paramagnetic ground state has at most short-range nonstabilizerness.</p>

            <h2>Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the chaos bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by concerning the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and treating the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of displacive ferroelectricity. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework provides a tractable basis to understand and quantitatively describe a wide range of phase transitions across ferroelectric systems under different thermodynamic or external conditions.</p>

            <p>Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion or fracture resistance. In dispersions, the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials. In conjugation with superposition methods, they allow to better capture the behavior of materials of complex rheology. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition in the continuous-phase-dominated region. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, independently of the frequency, whereas the elastic response is almost unchanged.</p>

            <p>The search for fractional quantized Hall phases in the absence of a magnetic field has primarily targeted flat-band systems that mimic the features of a Landau level. In an alternative approach, the fractional excitonic insulator (FEI) has been proposed as a correlated electron-hole fluid that arises near a band inversion between bands of different angular momentum with strong interactions. It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state. We discuss implications for recent numerical studies on a chiral spin liquid phase in interacting Chern insulator models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh</p>
            <p>Coherent collective motion is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Here, we report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the global polar order are excluded volume repulsions and long-ranged repulsive torques. This mechanism requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically respond to chemical gradients, or equivalently, pair colloids sliding together a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating away from each other. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. Furthermore, liquid flocks are observed for a range of chemo-attractive inter-particle forces. Various properties of these two distinct flocking phases are contrasted and discussed. We complement these results with stability analysis of a hydrodynamic model, which admits the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state observed in particle-based simulations.</p>

            <p>High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</p>

Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by a substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-su\-per\-con\-duc\-ting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced helical superconductivity.</p>

The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle.

We demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity.

            <p>Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates.</p>

            <p>Spin-splitting induced in a conventional superconductor weakens superconductivity by destroying spin-singlet and creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that such an effect is also caused by an adjacent compensated antiferromagnet, which yields no net spin-splitting. We find that the antiferromagnet produces Néel triplet Cooper pairs, whose pairing amplitude oscillates rapidly in space similar to the antiferromagnet's spin. The emergence of these unconventional Cooper pairs reduces the singlet pairs' amplitude, thereby lowering the superconducting critical temperature. We develop a quasiclassical Green's functions description of the system employing a two-sublattice framework. It successfully captures the rapid oscillations in the Cooper pairs' amplitude at the lattice spacing scale as well as their smooth variation on the larger coherence length scale. Employing the theoretical framework thus developed, we investigate this Néel proximity effect in a superconductor/antiferromagnet bilayer as a function of interfacial exchange, disorder, and chemical potential, finding rich physics. Our findings also offer insights into experiments which have found a larger than expected suppression of superconductivity by an adjacent antiferromagnet.</p>

            <h2>Disordered Parity Anomalous Semimetal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Hao Bi, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen</p>
            <p>The parity anomalous semimetal is a topological state of matter characterized by its semi-metallic nature and a quantum Hall conductance of one-half $e^{2}/h$ ($e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant). Here we investigate the topological phase transition driven by disorder in a semi-magnetic structure of topological insulator, and narrow-gap weak topological insulator film. We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads to a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive metal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the topological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local density of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless Dirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half quantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. Our findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal significantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological phase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Proof of the absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo, Mizuki Yamaguchi, Yuuya Chiba</p>
            <p>We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, "nontrivial" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and "local" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian, and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.</p>

            <h2>Modulation of Non-equilibrium Structures of Active Dipolar Particles by an External Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Parage, Sara Jabbari-Farouji</p>
            <p>We study the impact of an external alignment field on the structure formation and polarization behavior of low-density dipolar active particles in three dimensions. Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking.</p>

            <h2>An accurate DFT-1/2 approach for shallow defect states: Efficient calculation of donor binding energies in silicon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Claes, Bart Partoens, Dirk Lamoen, Marcelo Marques, Lara K. Teles</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of shallow-donor electron binding energies is critical for device modeling, dopant activation, and donor-based quantum technologies. Traditional beyond-DFT approaches (e.g., hybrid functionals, GW) are prohibitively expensive for the large supercells needed to capture the extended, hydrogenic wavefunctions, while semi-local DFT underestimates band gaps and suffers from delocalization errors. We present a simple, practical protocol for shallow donors based on the DFT-1/2 approximate quasiparticle correction that maintains the computational cost of standard DFT and enables supercells up to thousands of atoms. This approach provides a straightforward and reproducible workflow that delivers reliable donor binding energies with minimal computational overhead. Applied to group-V donors in Si, Si:X (X= P, As, Sb, Bi), the method yields binding energies in close agreement with experiment. We found that, for Si:Bi, it is essential to include spin-orbit coupling to achieve near-experimental values with a difference of only $\sim$ 4 meV. For arsenic, the method yields excellent agreement with experiment, with a difference of only ~0.3 meV. For antimony, the results match experiment to within ~5 meV, and for phosphorus, the deviation is within ~8 meV. Beyond its high accuracy, DFT-1/2 offers a significant practical advantage, providing a straightforward, reproducible, and transferable workflow that is less demanding than hybrid functional approaches while remaining fully generalizable to other shallow impurities in semiconductors.</p>

The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Subir Sachdev, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. The results from the $\text{FL}^*$ phase show good consistency with current experimental data. Conversely, the results for the SDW phase are highly sensitive to the ordering momentum along the $z$-direction. An ordering vector of $Q = (\pi, \pi, \pi)$ yields predictions that starkly disagree with the experiment. The only possibility for agreement within the SDW scenario is to assume an ordering momentum of $Q = (\pi, \pi, 0)$. However, even in this specific case, the SDW scenario predicts a marginally smaller Yamaji angle at $\phi=0$ than the FL* theory, and a second Yamaji peak near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$, which was not observed in the experiment. In reality, the Néel ordering vector is likely uncorrelated between adjacent layers, so that there is no coherent interlayer transport of hole-pocket quasiparticles in the SDW scenario, and consequently no Yamaji effect. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.</p>

            <h2>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Gioia, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</p>

            <h2>Surface Binding Energies for Amorphous Plagioclase Feldspar Calculated using Molecular Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Ricketts, Benjamin A. Clouter-Gergen, Anastasis Georgiou, Deborah Berhanu, Liam S. Morrissey</p>
            <p>Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts, the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range. This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (<10% for albite and <20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.</p>

            <p>At a generic volume- to area-law entanglement transition in a many-body system, quantum chaos is arrested. We argue that this tends to imply the vanishing of a certain "mass" term in the field theory of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate noninteracting critical point.</p>

            <p>Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moiré Bloch bands give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order, electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the BCD paradigm.</p>

            <p>The ability to modulate the photoluminescence (PL) of nanomaterials via spin-related effects is vital for many emerging quantum technologies, with nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging being particular areas of focus. Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) are among the most common forms of luminescent nanomaterials, appealing due to their ease of synthesis, tunability through organic chemistry, high brightness, and natural biocompatibility. However, the observation of room temperature, spin-dependent PL has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of PL modulation of CQDs by magnetic fields ($\sim 10$ mT) under ambient conditions. We synthesize a series of CQDs using 19 different amino acids, which have a range of PL emission spectra and exhibit a clear magneto-PL effect (up to $\sim 1$% change). Furthermore, an electron spin resonance is detected in the PL with a g-factor of g $\approx$ 2, suggesting a process similar to the radical pair mechanism is responsible. Finally, we show that the magneto-PL contrast decreases in the presence of paramagnetic species, which we attribute to an increase in magnetic noise-induced spin relaxation in the CQDs. Our work brings new functionalities to these commonly used and biocompatible luminescent nanoparticles, opening new opportunities for in situ quantum sensing and imaging of biological samples.</p>

            <p>We predict the realization of ultrastrong coupling between magnons of antiferromagnets and photons in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor heterostructures at terahertz frequencies, from both quantum and classical perspectives. The hybridization of the two magnon modes with photons strongly depends on the applied magnetic field: at zero magnetic field, only a single antiferromagnetic mode with a lower frequency couples to the photon, forming a magnon-polariton, while using a magnetic field activates coupling for both antiferromagnetic modes. The coupling between magnon and photon is ultrastrong with the coupling constant $\sim$ 100 GHz exceeding 10% of the antiferromagnetic resonant frequency. The superconductor modulates the spin of the resulting magnon-polaritons and the group velocity, achieving values amounting to several tenths of the speed of light, which promises strong tunability of magnon transport in antiferromagnets by superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrzej Biborski, Michał Zegrodnik</p>
            <p>Strong evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been very recently reported experimentally in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and gathered a significant amount of interest. Here we consider the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moiré superlattice emerging in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime. By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \pm id_{xy} )$ and $p_y(p_{x}\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of width three(four), respectively.</p>

            <p>Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) studies revealed that a heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ exhibits van Hove singularities and the Dirac point near the Fermi level $E_{\mathrm F}$, which are key signatures of strong-correlation effects and quantum geometry. We have constructed a two-dimensional 12-orbital \textit{Dirac-Anderson} model as an effective model for CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The band structure and Fermi-surface topology of the Dirac-Anderson model agree well with the ARPES data and the DFT+$U$ calculations. We show that the quantum geometry strongly favors magnetic-monopole fluctuations because of the Dirac point at the $M$ point. By solving the linearized Éliashberg equation, we demonstrate that the $B_{1u}$ and $B_{2g}$ representations, spin-triplet states originating from the Dirac point, exhibit the leading superconducting instabilities. By comparing the random-phase approximation and the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we further demonstrate that strong-correlation effects mitigate the influence of quantum geometry. The phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ under pressure is discussed in connection with the theoretical results.</p>

            <p>We theoretically predict the interaction between polaritonic excitations arising from the coupling of a cavity photon mode with bound to continuum intersubband transitions in a doped quantum well. The resulting exciton bound by photon exchange, recently demonstrated experimentally, exhibits a binding energy that can be continuously tuned by varying the cavity frequency. We show that polariton-polariton interactions, originating from both Coulomb interactions and Pauli blocking, can be dramatically enhanced by reducing the exciton binding energy, thereby increasing the effective Bohr radius along the growth direction. This regime is reminiscent of Rydberg atoms, where weak binding leads to strong quantum interactions. Our predictions indicate that this physics can give rise to giant quantum optical nonlinearities in the mid and far infrared, a spectral region that remains largely unexplored in quantum optics and offers exciting opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications.</p>

            <h2>Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap topological excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization lengths, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicate the situation, leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters in realistic models of nanowires currently being used experimentally. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms. A general consequence of our work is that `topology' in finite disordered wires may not be uniquely defined, necessitating a careful analysis which depends on the context.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian A. Lawn, Nicholas S. Davis, Daniel S. Kosov</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</p>

In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</p>

            <h2>Study of the Molecular Level Mechanism of Nanoscale Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobin Alosious, Fiach Antaw, Matt Trau, Shern R. Tee, Debra J. Searles</p>
            <p>This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.</p>

            <h2>Imaging magnetic flux trapping in lanthanum hydride using diamond quantum sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Chen, Junyan Wen, Ze-Xu He, Jing-Wei Fan, Xin-Yu Pan, Cheng Ji, Huiyang Gou, Xiaohui Yu, Liucheng Chen, Gang-Qin Liu</p>
            <p>Lanthanum hydride has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its signatures of superconductivity at around 250 K (1, 2). However, the megabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present extraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its Meissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains between its working pressure and the pressure required to study the superconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas as the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is extended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the Meissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia borane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the transition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In addition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux trapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample. Our work provides compelling evidence for superconductivity in lanthanum hydride and highlights the importance of spatially resolved techniques in characterizing samples under ultrahigh pressure conditions.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined Orders, Quantum Criticality and Skyrmions in Tunable Topological Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuepeng Wang, Johannes S. Hofmann, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Skyrmions are emergent many-body excitations that lie at the heart of both multi-component quantum Hall-like systems and deconfined quantum criticality. In a companion article (X. Wang et al., arXiv:2507.22971), we studied a microscopic time-reversal symmetric model of tunable interacting Chern bands using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and presented evidence for the emergence of robust skyrmion excitations. These charged excitations emerge in the vicinity of a many-body insulator at a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, and lead to the onset of superconductivity when doped away from the insulating phase. Here, we present quantum Monte-Carlo results and a complementary field-theoretical analysis for the quantum phase transition(s) that arise between the intertwined phases as a function of two distinct tuning parameters. Our numerical results are consistent with a single continuous quantum phase transition between an insulating Chern antiferromagnet and a fully gapped superconductor, with an emergent SO(5) symmetry at the putative critical point, highly suggestive of deconfined quantum (pseudo-)criticality. We also present a detailed comparison between the momentum-resolved spectral functions associated with the neutral collective modes, single electron and composite spin-polaron excitations obtained using a combination of Monte-Carlo computations and a Bethe-Salpeter analysis built on top of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. We end with a brief outlook on some of the interesting open problems.</p>

            <h2>Impurity-induced topological decomposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianxing Shi, Chuhang Zhang, Liang Jin, Linhu Li</p>
            <p>Controlling topological phases is a central goal in quantum materials and related fields, enabling applications such as robust transport and programmable edge states. Here we uncover a mechanism in which local on-site impurities act as knobs to decompose global topological properties in discrete steps. In non-Hermitian lattices with spectral winding topology, we show that each impurity sequentially reduces the winding number by one, which is directly manifested as a stepwise decomposition of quantized plateaus in the steady-state response. Based on this principle, we further develop a scheme that sequentially induces topological edge states under impurity control, in a class of Hermitian topological systems constructed by doubling the non-Hermitian ones. Our findings reveal a general scheme to tune global topological properties with local perturbations, establishing a universal framework for impurity-controlled topological phases and offering a foundation for future exploration of reconfigurable topological phenomena across diverse physical platforms.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism, Kagome Flat Band, and Weyl Fermion States in Magnetically Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avinash Sah, Ting-Yong Lim, Clayton Conner, Amarnath Chakraborty, Giovanni Vignale, Tay-Rong Chang, Pavlo Sukhachov, Guang Bian</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic (AM) compounds have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing unconventional quantum phases, enabled by their unique spin-split band structure at zero net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariia Stepanova, Minh Ngo, Mashnoon Alam Sakib, Wills Harris, Joshua Bocanegra, Ruqian Wu, Kristie J. Koski, Maxim R. Shcherbakov</p>
            <p>Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.</p>

            <p>Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication, simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample. Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle, and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Reinforcement learning-guided optimization of critical current in high-temperature superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mouyang Cheng, Qiwei Wan, Bowen Yu, Eunbi Rha, Michael J Landry, Mingda Li</p>
            <p>High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\% of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zefei Han, Haojin Wang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Much is known about the magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic insulators, yet little is understood about multiferroic metals. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to identify the sliding van der Waals bilayer $1T$-NbTe$_2$ as a multiferroic metal, where in-plane metallicity coexists with out-of-plane polarization and magnetism. It exhibits linear magnetoelectric response, originating from direct spin-charge interactions as a result of external field-modulated Fermi energy, which differs from the spin-charge-lattice or spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in multiferroic insulators. We derive a universal formula for magnetoelectric coupling parameters of multiferroic metals, which highlights the crucial role of interlayer dielectric permittivity in enhancing performance. Our work provides insights for exploring magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and designing functional materials with strong magnetoelectric coupling.</p>

The transformation occurs independently of thermal fluctuations and is viewed as a quantum phase transition. The resulting phase map mirrors QCD phase diagram, delineating confined, premelted, and fully deconfined vortex phases. The nature of these phases is discussed. Transitions between phases are governed by light induced depairing and phase fluctuations, establishing a new class of light-induced topological transitions.</p>

            <h2>Normal Dirac Semimetal Phase and Zeeman-Induced Topological Fermi Arc in PtSr5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Inkyou Lee, Churlhi Lyi, Youngkuk Kim</p>
            <p>Pt-Sr binary intermetallics encompass a broad range of stoichiometries and crystal structures, stabilized by complex bonding and multivalent chemistry. The Sr-rich end member, PtSr5, is recently identified via artificial-intelligence-guided materials design as a body-centered tetragonal compound (I4/m). Using first-principles calculations, we show that PtSr5 hosts a Dirac semimetal phase with trivial Z2 topology, classified as a normal Dirac semimetal. A symmetry-indicator analysis based on parity eigenvalues at the eight time-reversal-invariant momenta confirms that all Z2 invariants-evaluated on time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional subspaces of momentum space with a direct band gap-are trivial, thereby establishing the topologically trivial nature of the Dirac semimetal phase. Nonetheless, our calculations reveal that applying an external Zeeman magnetic field along the z-axis drives the system into a Weyl semimetal phase, as corroborated by characteristic changes in the computed surface states. This work demonstrates the tunability of topological phases in PtSr5 via external perturbations and highlights the effectiveness of AI-based materials exploration in discovering new quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Switching between Skyrmions and Yoshimori Spin Spirals via Li Absorption in Janus Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyuan Jiang, Jian Wu, Weiyi Pan</p>
            <p>Chiral magnetic textures have attracted considerable attention owing to their topological properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. Here, we employ first-principles calculations together with atomic spin dynamics simulations to explore the switching between skyrmions and Yoshimori-type spin spirals induced by Li adsorption in Janus two-dimensional (2D) CrTeSe. We show that selective Li adsorption on either the Se- or Te-terminated surface stabilizes distinct magnetic phases: Li adsorption on the Se side favors a Yoshimori-type spin spiral, whereas adsorption on the Te side stabilizes the skyrmionic state. This contrast originates from site-dependent modifications of exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy (MA), and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition, the response of magnetic textures to out-of-plane magnetic fields differs strongly between the two systems. These results demonstrate that surface adsorption provides an effective strategy for reversible control of chiral magnetic states in 2D magnets, while also offering fundamental insights into the competing interactions that govern the stability of skyrmions and Yoshimori spin spirals. Our findings highlight the potential of Janus 2D materials as a versatile platform for engineering tunable spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr, and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 Å to 8.082 Å, and they exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%, respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied, the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Allam, Brook Wander, Aayush R. Singh</p>
            <p>Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.</p>

            <p>It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd, in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment reduction can now be computed and compared among different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations, representing a significant step forward.</p>

            <p>The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of layered, two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moiré physics with stacks of twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than in 2D van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after obvious issues of contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In hybrid interfaces between a chemically inert 2D material and an oxide membrane, the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. In all these material systems, the interface morphology is best characterized using cross-sectional imaging and is necessary to corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. When imaging the bicrystal in projection, conventional through-focal imaging is found to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasizes the need for reliable characterization methods.</p>

            <p>Proper treatment of the many-body interactions is of paramount importance in our understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here we investigate the effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional Fermi gases throughout the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We include self-consistently in the self energy treatment the entire particle-hole $T$ matrix, which constitutes a renormalization of the bare interaction that appears in the particle-particle scattering $T$ matrix, leading to a screening of the pairing interaction and hence a dramatic reduction of the pairing gap and the transition temperature. The BKT transition temperature $T_\text{BKT}$ is determined by the critical phase space density, for which the pair density and pair mass are determined using a pairing fluctuation theory, which accommodates self-consistently the important self-energy feedback in the treatment of finite-momentum pairing fluctuations. The screening strength varies continuously from its maximum in the BCS limit to essentially zero in BEC limit. In the unitary regime, it leads to an interaction-dependent shift of $T_\text{BKT}$ towards the BEC regime. This shift is crucial in an attempt to explain experimental data quantitatively, which often depends on the interaction strength. Our findings are consistent with available experimental results in the unitary and BEC regimes and with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the BCS and unitary regimes.</p>

            <p>Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.</p>

            <p>Argyrodite-type Ag-based sulfides combine exceptionally low lattice thermal and high ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric and solid-state energy applications. In this work, we studied Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) argyrodite family by combining chemical-bonding analysis, lattice vibrational properties simulation, and experimental measurements to investigate their structural and thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we propose a two-channel lattice-dynamics model based on Grüneisen-derived phonon lifetimes and compare it to an approach using machine-learned interatomic potentials. Both approaches are able to predict thermal conductivity in agreement with experimental lattice thermal conductivities along the whole temperature range, highlighting their potential suitability for future high-throughput predictions. Our findings also reveal a relationship between bond heterogeneity arising from weakly bonded Ag+ ions and occupied antibonding states in Ag-S and Ag-Ag interactions and strong anharmonicity, including large Grüneisen parameters, and low sound velocities, which are responsible for the low lattice thermal conductivity of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6, and Ag8SiS6. We furthermore show that thermal and ionic conductivities in all three compounds are independent of each other and can likely be tuned individually.</p>

            <p>Superconducting materials are a key for technologies enabling a large number of devices including THz wave mixers and single photon detectors, though limited at very low temperatures for conventional superconductors. High temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures. $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves (100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K. We further explore these nonlinear effects by detecting THz high-order harmonic mixing for signals from 200 GHz up to 1.4 THz using a local oscillator at 100 GHz. Our results open a path to an easy-fabricated HTS nonlinear nanodevice based on dimensional confinement suitable for terahertz applications.</p>

            <h2>Universal Relations in Long-range Quantum Spin Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Sun, Lei Feng, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding the emergence of novel collective behaviors in strongly interacting systems lies at the heart of quantum many-body physics. Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.</p>

            <h2>Exploring high-dimensional random landscapes: from spin glasses to random matrices, passing through simple chaotic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Pacco</p>
            <p>High-dimensional random landscapes underlie phenomena as diverse as glassy physics and optimization in machine learning, and even their simplest toy models already display extraordinarily rich behavior. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of that behavior, by combining landscape-based approaches, via the Kac-Rice formalism, with dynamical approaches, paying special attention to both systems with reciprocal and with non-reciprocal interactions. After surveying core techniques and results through the spherical p-spin model, this thesis delivers three main advances: (i) exact dynamic-static comparison in a solvable class of models with non-reciprocal interactions, pinpointing differences and similarities of the two approaches; (ii) a stability-based calculation of the mean number of fixed points (i.e., annealed complexity) of the Sompolinsky-Crisanti-Sommers random neural network, for any level of non-reciprocity; (iii) two approaches to probe the barriers and the distribution of deep local minima in the landscape of the p-spin model; (iv) some results on the overlaps among eigenvectors of spiked, correlated random matrices, which are useful to explore the geometry of energy landscapes. Together, these results sharpen our understanding of these systems, while providing new tools and opening new doors for future research directions.</p>

            <h2>Robust and tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions</h2>

            <p>Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature scaling laws in unconventional flat-band superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Buthenhoff, Yusuke Nishida</p>
            <p>In flat-band superconductors, the electron pairing is strongly enhanced so that the critical temperature scales linearly with the interaction strength. Identifying the governing pairing mechanism in flat-band superconducting systems is therefore a central task, which may be constrained by experimental probes via low-temperature scaling measurements. A key observable underlying the Meissner effect and the resulting divergent DC conductivity is the superfluid weight. While it is well established that the minimal quantum metric provides the dominant contribution to the superfluid weight in conventional superconductors with isolated flat bands, recent studies indicate that the unconventional pairing can generate additional nonlocal quantum geometric terms. This motivates us to derive the low-temperature scaling law of the superfluid weight in two-dimensional flat-band superconductors with sufficiently isolated bands. In particular, we consider the gap function with point or line nodes classified by the Weierstrass preparation theorem. Beyond the superfluid weight, we additionally deliver explicit low-temperature scaling laws of the order parameter, the tunneling conductance, the specific heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate to provide complementary experimental discriminants of the underlying pairing symmetry. The implications of our results are also elucidated by applying them to a selection of superconducting states in $C_{6v}$-symmetric systems.</p>

            <p>Discovering materials with previously unreported crystal frameworks is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.</p>

            <p>The interaction of a quantum two-level system with a resonant driving field results in the emergence of Rabi oscillations, which are the hallmark of a controlled manipulation of a quantum state on the Bloch sphere. This all-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for quantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a WSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using picosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is probed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level exciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and excited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate that the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying driving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data. Our results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based high-performance, on-demand single photon sources.</p>

            <h2>A platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moinak Ghosh, Stefan Heinze, Souvik Paul</p>
            <p>Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.</p>

            <p>Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.</p>

            <p>Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of the produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing information in a microscopic system using its memory.</p>

            <p>Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhavik Kumar, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>Cold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile and highly controllable platform for quantum simulation, capable of realizing a broad family of Hubbard models, and allowing site-resolved readout via quantum gas microscopes. In principle, arbitrary site-dependent potentials can also be implemented; however, since lattice spacings are typically below the diffraction limit, precisely applying and calibrating these potentials remains challenging. Here, we propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to measure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol is the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach resonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute. Given this, we demonstrate that collecting snapshots from the time evolution of a known, easily prepared initial state is sufficient to accurately estimate the potential. Our protocol is robust to state preparation errors and uncertainty in the hopping rate. This paves the way toward precision quantum simulation with arbitrary potentials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Takahashi, Tetsuro Abe, Yasuhito Nakamura, Ryo Hidaka, Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>The portfolio optimization problem is a critical issue in asset management and has long been studied. Markowitz's mean-variance model has fundamental limitations, such as the assumption of a normal distribution for returns and sensitivity to estimation errors in input parameters. In this research, we propose a novel graph theory-based approach, the cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set (CR-WMIS) model, to overcome these limitations. The CR-WMIS model pursues the optimization of both return and risk characteristics. It integrates the risk diversification effect by selecting the largest number of weakly correlated stocks, a feature of the maximum independent set (MIS) model, with the weighting effect based on expected returns from the weighted maximum independent set (WMIS) model. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a five-year backtesting simulation (April 2019 - March 2024) using real market data from the S&P 500. For this task, we employed a simulated-bifurcation-based solver for finding high-quality solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, which has not been sufficiently explored in previous MIS and WMIS studies. The results demonstrate that the CR-WMIS model exhibits superiority in both return and risk characteristics compared to the conventional MIS and WMIS models, as well as the market index (S&P 500). This study provides a practical portfolio optimization method that overcomes the theoretical limitations of the mean-variance model, contributing to both the advancement of academic theory and the support of practical investment decision-making.</p>

The implementation is realized through the recently released VASP-Python interface, enabling the application of user-defined fields directly within the standard VASP software and providing great flexibility and control. We demonstrate the application of this approach with diverse case studies, including molecular adsorption on electrified surfaces, field ion microscopy, electrochemical solid-water interfaces, and implicit solvent models.</p>

We demonstrate that the elastic predictions for the lattice constants of the components align with the values obtained from their total energy counterparts, within the limits of computational errors and uncertainties. Furthermore, a phenomenological analysis of the elastic energy stored in the superlattices facilitates the evaluation of the excess energies associated with the interfaces present in these systems.

            <p>Using stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method and density matrix renormalization group, we study the ground-state phase diagram of $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. In this model, we consider two kinds of nearest-neighbor interaction (intra-hexagon interaction $J_1$ and inter-hexagon $J_2$) and the selected third nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along $x$ direction. From our calculations, there are five phases in the parameters regime $0<\lambda_1=J_2/J_1<4, 0<\lambda_2=J_3/J_1<4$, including a Néel antiferromagentic phase, a Haldane-like symmetry protected topological phase, a hexagon phase and two dimer phases. In the Haldane-like SPT phase, we characterized its topological nature using the degeneracy of ground-state energy under open boundary condition and the entanglement spectrum. To characterize the phase boundaries, we use spin stiffness and Binder cumulant to do the comprehensive finite-size scalings. From data collapse, the critical behaviors of all the nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the 3D $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. As a theoretical exploration, our work establishes a foundational framework for understanding 2D magnetism on the SHO lattice.</p>

            <p>Magnetic phase transitions between ordered phases are often understood on the basis of semi-classical spin models. Deviations from the classical description due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases at low temperature.</p>

            <p>Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</p>

            <p>For Markov jump processes on irreducible networks with finite number of sites, we derive a general and explicit expression of the squared coefficient of variation for the net number of transitions from one site to a connected site in a given time window of observation (i.e., an `integrated current' as dynamical output). Such expression, which in itself is particularly useful for numerical calculations, is then elaborated to obtain the interrelation with the precision on the intrinsic timing of the recurrences of the forward and backward transitions. In biochemical ambits, such as enzyme catalysis and molecular motors, the precision on the timing is quantified by the so-called randomness parameter and the above connection is established in the long time limit of monitoring and for an irreversible site-site transition; the present extension to finite time and reversibility adds a new dimension. Some kinetic and thermodynamic inequalities are also derived.</p>

            <p>Harnessing non-Markovian effects has emerged as a resource for quantum control, where a structured environment can act as a quantum memory. We investigate the quench dynamics from specific initial states to equilibrium steady states in strongly correlated quantum dot systems. The distance between quantum states is quantified using the Bures metric, which endows the space of reduced density matrices with a Riemannian geometric structure. Using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we demonstrate a quantum Mpemba effect arising from non-Markovianity. This effect is characterized by a relaxation slowdown due to information backflow from the bath to the system, which induces a pronounced memory effect. We show that the emergence of the non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect on the approach to a strongly correlated steady state is determined by the interplay between the initial-state-dependent non-Markovianity and the initial geometric distance between states. Our results underscore the critical role of memory effects in quantum quench dynamics and suggest new pathways for controlling anomalous relaxation in open quantum systems.</p>

We use a highly efficient and accurate computational approach, where the scattering rates are derived using only a few ab initio extracted matrix elements, while we account fully for intra-/inter valley/band transitions, screening from both electrons and holes, and bipolar transport effects. Our computed thermoelectric power-factor (PF) values show good agreement with experiments across densities and temperatures, while they indicate the upper limit of PF performance for this material. We show that the polar optical phonon and ionized impurity scattering (importantly including screening), influence significantly the transport properties, whereas the computationally expensive non-polar phonon scattering part (acoustic and non-polar optical) is somewhat weaker, especially for electrons, and at lower to intermediate temperatures. This insight is relevant in the study of half-Heusler and other polar thermoelectric materials in general. Although we use NbFeSb as an example, the method we employ is material agnostic and can be broadly applied efficiently for electronic and thermoelectric materials in general, with more than 10x reduction in computational cost compared to fully ab initio methods, while retaining ab-initio accuracy.</p>

            <h2>dynsight: an Open Python Platform for Simulation and Experimental Trajectory Data Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Martino, Matteo Becchi, Andrew Tarzia, Daniele Rapetti, Giovanni M. Pavan</p>
            <p>The study of complex many-body systems through the analysis of the trajectories of dynamically moving and interacting units is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from raw trajectory data typically involves several interconnected steps: (i) identifying and tracking objects, and resolving their trajectories (for example, in experimental systems where these are not automatically available as in molecular simulations); (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle and analyze using suitable descriptors; and (iii) extracting meaningful information from these data. Each of these tasks often requires substantial programming skills, the use of different types of representations or methods, and the development of interfaces between them. Despite the progress made by new tools targeting individual steps, integrating them under a common framework would lower the barrier to use (especially for diverse communities of users), reduce fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in trajectory data analysis. To this end, we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation or experimentally resolved trajectories. Dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and supports the analysis of time-series and trajectory data to unravel the dynamic complexity of systems across different scales. Dynsight is open source (available at this http URL) and can be easily installed using pip.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Habibur Rahman, Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi</p>
            <p>We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</p>

            <p>Memristors are emerging as key electronic components that retain resistance states without power. Their non-volatile nature and ability to mimic synaptic behavior make them ideal for next-generation memory technologies and neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain. In this study, we present a novel organic spintronic memristor based on a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co heterostructure, exhibiting biologically inspired synaptic behavior. Driven by fluorine atom migration within the PVDF layer, the device demonstrates both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) under controlled electrical polarization. Distinctively, the resistance states can also be modulated by an external magnetic field via the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, introducing a non-electrical means of tuning synaptic plasticity. This magnetic control mechanism enables multi-state modulation without compromising device performance or endurance. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN) simulations incorporating this magnetic tuning capability reveal enhanced pattern recognition accuracy and improved training stability, especially at high learning rates. These findings underscore the potential of organic spintronic memristors as high-performance, low-power neuromorphic elements, particularly suited for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.</p>

            <h2>Scattering of a massive quantum vortex-dipole from an obstacle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alice Bellettini, Enrico Ortu, Vittorio Penna</p>
            <p>In binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates, massive-vortex dipoles can arise, and undergo scattering processes against obstacles. These show an intriguing dynamics, governed by the strongly nonlinear character of the quantum vortex motion, where we are able to highlight the effects of the boundaries. We first characterize such scattering dynamics via some point-like models, for the cases of an unbounded plane and a confined geometry. Within this framework, we find two fundamental scattering behaviors of a vortex dipole, the "fly-by" and the "go-around" processes. By plotting the deflection angle of the dipole versus the impact parameter we are able to quantify the transition between different scattering behaviors. We then are able to introduce an analytical distinction of the two scenarios, basing on the point-like model for the plane geometry. Furthermore, another interesting result shows the emergence of an on-average massless dynamics whenever the nonlinear interactions with the obstacle become negligible. Alongside, we investigate the quantum dipole scattering via the numerical simulation of two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, describing the quantum mixture at a mean-field level. In this way, we benchmark the point-like model against the mean-field simulations.</p>

            <h2>Prediction of a topological phase transition in exchange alternating spin-1 nanographene chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João C. G. Henriques, Yelko del Castillo, Ricardo Segundo, Jan Phillips, Joaquín Fernández-Rossier</p>
            <p>The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.</p>

            <h2>Potential-based formalism for electrodynamics of media with weak spatial dispersion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yury Solyaev</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a potential-based formalism for Maxwell's equations in isotropic media with weak spatial dispersion within the electric quadrupole-magnetic dipole approximation. We introduce an operator form of the constitutive relations along with a modified Lorenz gauge condition, which enables the derivation of decoupled generalized wave equations for electromagnetic potentials. For time-harmonic processes, we derive the representation of general solution for these equations as a combination of solutions to Helmholtz-type equations, whose parameters are determined by both standard and hyper-susceptibilities of the medium. We show that the proposed approach can be extended to more general constitutive relations and it provides a convenient framework for solving various applied problems. Specifically, using a derived closed-form solution for the problem of plane wave incidence on a planar interface, we demonstrate that a correct definition of the Poynting vector within the multipole theory must incorporate quadrupole effects -- an aspect overlooked in some previous works that has led to inconsistent results. We further establish the necessity of accounting for both propagated and evanescent longitudinal components in reflected and transmitted waves. The presence of these components, which follow directly from the general solution for electromagnetic potentials, is essential for satisfying all classical and additional boundary conditions in media with quadrupolar response (e.g., in metamaterials or quadrupolar liquid mixtures). The complete set of these boundary conditions is derived based on the least action principle, ensuring variational consistency with the field equations and generalizing previously known formulations of multipole theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego García, Sergio Arias, Rosa López</p>
            <p>Quantum heat engines are nanoscale devices that convert heat into work by exploiting quantum effects, such as coherence and interference. Previous studies of these devices did not consider spin-dependent effects, which can influence the thermoelectric performance of the engine. In this work, we study the thermoelectric behavior of a quantum heat engine based on an Aharonov-Bohm ring - a mesoscopic ring where electrons exhibit interference depending on the magnetic flux it encloses - incorporating Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the electron's motion and spin. We find that Rashba SOI enhances the figure of merit $ZT$, measure of the engine's conversion efficiency. Our results suggest that controlling spin-dependent interference could lead to improvements in the fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices.</p>

We observe robust self-similar dynamics and a universal critical exponent consistent with diffusion-like coarsening, driven by vortex and antivortex annihilation induced by the interlayer coupling. Our results extend the understanding of universal dynamics in many-body systems and provide a robust foundation for quantitative tests of nonequilibrium effective field theories.</p>

            <h2>Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.</p>

            <p>The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.</p>

            <h2>Tuning laser-induced optical breakdown and cavitation through the ionic environment in aqueous media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Cai, Yuhan Li, Yunqiao Liu, Benlong Wang, Mingbo Li</p>
            <p>Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it. This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation. Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry, rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.</p>

            <p>In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</p>

            <p>The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</p>

This behavior challenges conventional two-oscillator strong-coupling models and is only partially reproduced by transfer-matrix and Green's-function calculations, suggesting the involvement of frequency-dependent self-energies or correlated dissipation.

            <p>Simulating real-time quantum dynamics in interacting spin systems is a fundamental challenge, where exact diagonalization suffers from exponential Hilbert-space growth and tensor-network methods face entanglement barriers. In this work, we introduce a scalable Pauli propagation approach that evolves local observables directly in the Heisenberg picture. Theoretically, we derive a priori error bounds governed by the Operator Stabilizer Rényi entropy (OSE) $\mathcal{S}^\alpha(O)$, which explicitly links the truncation accuracy to operator complexity and prescribes a suitable Top-$K$ truncation strategy. For the 1D Heisenberg model with $J_z = 0$, we prove the number of non-zero Pauli coefficients scales quadratically in Trotter steps, establishing the compressibility of Heisenberg-evolved operators. Numerically, we validate the framework on XXZ Heisenberg chain benchmarks, showing high accuracy with small $K$ in free regimes ($J_z = 0$) and competitive performance against tensor-network methods (e.g., TDVP) in interacting cases ($J_z = 0.5$). These results establish an observable-centric simulator whose cost is governed by operator complexity rather than entanglement, offering a practical alternative for studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the influence of torsion, Aharonov-Bohm flux, and external magnetic fields on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a confined quantum system. The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior.

Performing a position measurement that finds a particle in the barrier forces the tunneling electrons to transition from having a classically forbidden energy to an energy above the barrier height. We exploit this effect to define quantum tunneling engines that can use the unconditioned detection of virtually occupied states as a resource for power generation and cooling. Leveraging energy exchange with the detector, we show that the device can operate in a hybrid regime, enabling simultaneous cooling and power generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-assisted autonomous refrigeration and "checkpoint" cooling driven purely by a thermal bias, without the need for an applied potential. We also find a "purification-by-noise" effect when the measurement drives the system into a stationary dark state. These results underscore the intriguing dual role of measurement as a thermodynamic resource and a dark state generator.</p>

By utilising the nuclear charge of the ion, we are able to quantify in a targeted approach changes in the ion's solvation shell, thereby efficiently obtaining the free energy profile associated with the electron transfer, the transition state geometry and the evolution of the water network.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Study of Surface Wettability Effects on Pool Boiling of Water over Nanoscale Aluminum Substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhad Sotoudeh, Jafar Ghazanfarian</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to study pool boiling of water films on an ultra-thin planar aluminum substrate as well as the effect of surface wettability. The simulation geometry is a 10 nm-thick water film on an FCC aluminum substrate heated from 300 K to 900 K. The first peak acceleration onset time of the film, as the measure of the nucleation start, has been observed. The average heating rates of the near-wall water were 0.064, 0.048, and 0.035 K/ps for hydrophilic, neutral, and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. Boiling curves shows that the critical heat flux (CHF) equals 5216, 3979, and 2525 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 466, 502, and 561 K, respectively. The minimum heat flux (MHF, Leidenfrost point) is equal to 2157, 2463, and 2366 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 767, 784, and 746 K, respectively. Interfacial HTC remains higher for longer times under the hydrophilic condition, whereas Kapitza resistance is low initially but then increases sharply after transition to film boiling with the highest values for the hydrophobic surface. In general, the results demonstrate that engineering aluminum wettability towards intense hydrophilicity diminishes the explosive boiling point, increases CHF, and enhances nanoscale thermal management performance.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Materials Design via LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil Abhyankar, Sanchit Kabra, Saaketh Desai, Chandan K. Reddy</p>
            <p>Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties; and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation, memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery. Code: this https URL</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung-Hsuan Teh, Takahiro Orito</p>
            <p>We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <h2>The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory: from the Hamiltonian to applications in Cosmology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.</p>

            <p>Carbon nanotube (CNTs) materials, which exhibit intrinsically high electrical conductivity, are promising candidates for energy-efficient electronic devices. Recently, high-density CNT films have also been successfully employed as switching elements in non-volatile memory cells. However, the mechanism of electrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood. To identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT films, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense mesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities and lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies were quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their mutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous carbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed a nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the networks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying structural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit high curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with amorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role. These findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based memristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to guide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials.</p>

            <p>We study diffusion on multiplex networks with directed interlayer couplings. We demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even with undirected layers, interlayer directionality alone reproduces superdiffusion and the prime regime. We further reveal a new phenomenon, the directionality-induced jamming, whereby directed interlayer links hinder diffusion, fragmenting the system into dynamically disconnected components and preventing convergence to the steady state of the diffusion process. Via an optimization process, we show that this new regime is attainable in both toy models and real-world topologies. These findings underscore the crucial role of interlayer link directionality in shaping the emergent behavior of multiplex systems, with potential implications for the design and control of such systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana Shvydka, Victor Karpov</p>
            <p>Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhojyoti Khastagir, Kishalay Das, Pawan Goyal, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Niloy Ganguly</p>
            <p>Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities, effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints.

These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios-Petros Kitsaras, Johannes Tölle, Pierre-François Loos</p>
            <p>The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function $GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$ and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the traditional CCD methods.</p>

            <p>We investigate the intermolecular interactions between laser-cooled CaF and Ca, in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand atom-exchange reaction pathways. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods, we compute potential energy surfaces for nine electronic states arising from the lowest three asymptotes of Ca$_2$F trimer, within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed for the ground state and one of the excited states. We use a combination of the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, and the multireference configuration interaction method with single and double excitations. The ground (X)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$ electronic state of the trimer is significantly deep and highly anisotropic. The excited electronic states are also strongly bound. Notably, the potential energy surface of one of the excited states, (2)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$, lies below the ground-state asymptote of the trimer. By analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss atom-exchange reaction pathways involving both the ground-state interaction between CaF and Ca and the excited metastable state of Ca.</p>

            <p>We study the genetic interfaces between two species of an expanding colony that consists of individual microorganisms that reproduce and undergo diffusion, both at the frontier and in the interior. Within the bulk of the colony, the genetic interface is controlled in a simple way via interspecies interactions. However, at the frontier of the colony, the genetic interface width saturates at finite values for long times, both for neutral strains and interspecies interactions such as antagonism. This finite width arises from geometric effects: genetic interfaces drift toward local minima at an undulating colony frontier, where a focusing mechanism induced by curvature impedes diffusive mixing. Numerical simulations support a logarithmic dependence of the genetic interface width on the strength of the number fluctuations.</p>

The method employs a vacuum compatible resin that is rapidly cured by the electron beam during standard ion beam based preparation, eliminating the need for additional instrumentation or extensive sample handling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a porous SnSe + MXene electrode, a material system otherwise difficult to analyze via APT characterisation.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubham S. Ganar, Deepak J., Arindam Das</p>
            <p>This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating, and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions. High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound. In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant affinity and stability.</p>

            <p>Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution.</p>

            <p>A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size independent) and $\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision measurements beyond particle number measurements.</p>

            <p>A computational approach has been developed for the analysis of the properties of 3D dislocation substructures generated by the vector density continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), within the framework of crystal plasticity. In the CDD framework, the dislocation density on the individual slip systems is represented by vector fields with a unique dislocation line direction at each point in space. The evolution of these density fields is governed by a set of transport-reaction equations coupled with crystal mechanics. This detailed picture of the dislocation system enables mesoscale plasticity simulations based on dislocation properties at the lattice level. In the current work, a computational approach based on streamline construction is proposed to obtain the statistical properties of the dislocation substructures generated by CDD. Streamlines are obtained by travelling along the tangent of the vector density and velocity fields of the dislocation system, which enables us to construct the dislocation lines and their paths in the deformed crystal in 3D. The streamlines are computed by numerical integration of a set of partial differential equations for the parameterized tangent fields. Here, we use this approach to extract microstructure parameters from the CDD simulations that are relevant to substructure-sensitive crystal plasticity models. These parameters include the mean free path and average mobile dislocation segment length, as well as the dislocation wall volume fraction, together with the corresponding distributions. The results show that, past a short initial rise during monotonic loading, both the mobile dislocation segment length and dislocation mean free path decrease with the applied strain, which is consistent with the models used in the crystal plasticity literature.</p>

            <p>In unconventional high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors, the intricate interplay between the non-ergodic bad metal and the strange metal state has remained enigmatic. Herein, we unravel this mystery using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and the temperature-dependent effective potential method. Our investigation, centered on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ , provides the first simulation report on the $B_{1g}$ phonon anomaly, unveiling thermal decoupling induced by the bond weakening between the Ba atom and CuO$_2$ plane. This decoupling emerges as a pivotal underpinning behind several puzzling phenomena in high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our results indicate that the effective temperature on the BaO plane deviates from that of the CuO$_2$ plane at low temperatures. Furthermore, we delineate the correlation between thermal decoupling and the Planckian dissipation, rigorously and quantitatively revealing a connection between linear-$T$ resistivity, Uemura relation, and superconducting domes, which are known to be the most important unsolved mysteries of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The suppressed isotope effect ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ $\approx$ 0.02) in cuprates is also quantitatively explained from thermal decoupling. Our discoveries offer a revolutionary perspective on high-$T_c$ superconductivity, suggesting the potential for a transformative shift in our comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that the autonomous emergence of low-temperature layers within materials has the potential to revolutionize industrial thermal management challenges.</p>

            <p>Understanding how amorphous solids yield under shear is central to predicting material failure, yet prescribing reliable local yielding criteria remains a fundamental challenge. Here, through a mesoscale analysis of localized yielding, we reveal an intrinsic length scale (\zeta) that governs local failure, and demonstrate that \zeta grows with the age of the system. The age dependence shows up not only in the features of the distribution of local yield stress but also in the pseudogap exponent \theta, which provides a measure of marginal stability of the amorphous solids. These insights are made possible by a new method, termed the soft matrix approach, that allows local regions of an amorphous solid to yield within a minimally constrained, elastically coupled environment. By overcoming key limitations of earlier techniques, our approach provides a robust platform for probing failure mechanisms, particularly in soft disordered materials and paves the way for improved elastoplastic modeling of disordered solids.</p>

            <p>Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</p>

Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</p>

            <p>Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Be2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Universal quasi-Fermi liquid physics of one-dimensional interacting fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua D. Baktay, Adrian E. Feiguin, Julian Rincon</p>
            <p>We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Spin Liquid and Quantum Phase Transition in the Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Divic, Tomohiro Soejima, Valentin Crépel, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrew Millis</p>
            <p>Recent advances in moiré engineering motivate the study of lattice models of strongly-correlated electrons subjected to substantial orbital magnetic flux. We analyze the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where a chiral spin liquid phase may exist between weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic phases. We use matrix product state methods and analytical arguments to investigate this model compactified to cylinders of finite circumference. We uncover a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which, we argue, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition on odd-circumference cylinders. We numerically verify the spontaneous symmetry breaking and further demonstrate that this transition is associated with algebraic long-range correlations of various spin-singlet, charge-neutral operators. For even-circumference cylinders, the transition becomes a crossover associated with a large correlation length that grows substantially with circumference. Our findings suggest that in the two-dimensional limit, the transition to a chiral spin liquid phase is continuous and features critical fluctuations of the current.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Magnetic Field Driven Metal-Insulator Transition in Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Rohringer, Anton A. Markov</p>
            <p>We study the effects of an orbital magnetic field on the Mott metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard-Hofstadter model. We demonstrate that sufficiently large magnetic fields induce a Mott insulator-to-metal phase transition supporting our claim with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) numerical results. For both competing phases (metal and insulator) we observe a magnetic-fieldinduced metallization reflected in an enhancement of kinetic and potential energy. The kinetic energy of the Mott insulator increases due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect experienced by electrons virtually tunneling around an elementary plaquette which is, however, suppressed by strong correlations. The kinetic energy of the metallic phase, on the other hand, is more strongly affected by the magnetic field through a field-driven redistribution of spectral weight due to the formation of magnetic minibands. This leads to an increase of the kinetic energy which tends to stabilize the metallic state. Our theoretical results might be relevant for recent experimental studies on magnetic field driven insulator-to-metal transitions in strongly correlated materials such as VO2, $\lambda$-type organic conductors and moiré multilayers.</p>

            <h2>Vacancy-Induced Quantum Properties in 2D Silicon Carbide: Atomistic insights from semi-local and hybrid DFT calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhirup Patra</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.</p>
