            <h2>Electrical switching of an unconventional odd parity magnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Song, Srdjan Stavrić, Paolo Barone, Andrea Droghetti, Daniil S. Antonenko, Jörn W. F. Venderbos, Connor A. Occhialini, Batyr Ilyas, Emre Ergeçen, Nuh Gedik, Sang-Wook Cheong, Rafael M. Fernandes, Silvia Picozzi, Riccardo Comin</p>
            <p>Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electron-volt (eV) scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications. A variety of such magnetic states with nontrivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d, g, or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets. Achieving voltage-based control of the nonuniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energyefficient and compact devices for information storage and processing. Spin-spiral type-II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principle calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type-II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent the first direct observation of unconventional odd-parity magnetism in a spin-spiral type-II multiferroic, and open a new frontier of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.</p>

            <h2>Extracting average properties of disordered spin chains with translationally invariant tensor networks</h2>

            <p>We develop a tensor network-based method for calculating disorder-averaged expectation values in random spin chains without having to explicitly sample over disorder configurations. The algorithm exploits statistical translation invariance and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. We benchmark our method on the infinite-randomness critical point of the random transverse field Ising model.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Side-Gate Control of Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in a Composite Multiferroic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine Johnson, Michael Newburger, Michael Page, Roland K. Kawakami</p>
            <p>Composite multiferroics consisting of a ferroelectric material interfaced with a ferromagnetic material can function above room temperature and exhibit improved magnetoelectric (ME) coupling compared to single-phase multiferroic materials, making them desirable for applications in energy efficient electronic devices. In this study, we demonstrate electrical side-gate control of magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in single-crystalline ferromagnetic Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ thin films grown on ferroelectric PMN-PT (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ is selected due to its large magnetoelastic coupling and low magnetic damping. We find that the magnetoresistance curves of patterned Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ films are controlled by voltages applied to electrostatic side gates. Angle-dependent magnetoresistance scans reveal that the origin of this effect is strain-mediated variation of the magnetic anisotropy due to piezoelectric effects in the PMN-PT. This electrical control of magnetic properties could serve as a building block for future magnetoelectronic and magnonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Power Transfer in Magnetoelectric Resonators: a Combined Analytical and Finite Element Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma Van Meirvenne, Frederic Vanderveken, Daniele Narducci, Bart Sorée, Florin Ciubotaru, Christoph Adelmann</p>
            <p>We present an analytical model for power transfer in a magnetoelectric film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) comprising a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayer. The model describes the power flow between the elastic and magnetic systems, quantifying the transduction efficiency when the FBAR operates as a magnetic transducer. By applying the model to example systems using piezoelectric ScAlN and magnetostrictive CoFeB, Ni, or Terfenol-D layers, we demonstrate the potential for achieving high efficiencies in magnetoelectric transducers, rendering them ideal for efficient ferromagnetic resonance excitation. The validity of the model's assumptions is confirmed through comparison with a numerical finite element resonator model in COMSOL\texttrademark. The finite element model further enables a comprehensive study of the resonator's dynamic behavior, including transient and steady-state regimes, and the identification of resonant frequencies within the system.</p>

            <h2>Higgs mode in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of weak-coupling antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyu Chen, Naoto Tsuji, Philipp Werner</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides insights into the nonlinear response of correlated lattice systems. We simulate multipulse excitations in the Hubbard model using nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to extract the 2DCS signal of weak-coupling antiferromagnets with and without disorder. By comparing calculations with static and dynamic Hartree terms, and analyzing the waiting-time dependence of the signal, we identify the contribution of the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode to the spectroscopic features and the relevant underlying processes. With broadband pulses, the rephasing and nonrephasing peaks at the gap energy are found to be of predominant Higgs character, while the two-quantum signals originate from single-particle excitations. Using narrow-band pulses, we also demonstrate a strong enhancement of these Higgs-related signals at a pulse frequency of half the gap size.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic formulation of the spin magnetic octupole moment in bulk crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Ōiké, Robert Peters, Koki Shinada</p>
            <p>The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has drawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles. Despite the advances in research, a fundamental understanding of multipole moments, particularly octupole moments, remains limited due to the challenges of accurately treating the position operator in bulk crystals, which is integral to their definitions. In this paper, we overcome this problem by using a thermodynamic relation and derive a formula of the spin magnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies Středa formulas, which relate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM. One particularly important property is that the SMOM of $d$-wave altermagnets is dominated by nonrelativistic SMOMs regardless of spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, these nonrelativistic SMOMs exhibit a Néel order dependence that is predicted by the Landau theory of $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of magnetic octupole in periodic crystals and characterization of time-reversal-symmetry breaking antiferromagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takumi Sato, Satoru Hayami</p>
            <p>Magnetic multipoles have been recognized as order parameters characterizing magnetic structure in solids, with magnetic dipole serving as canonical examples in ferromagnets. Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as the order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric antiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred to as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic octupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a gauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals based on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Our expression reveals a contribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry as conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net magnetization. We demonstrate that such an anisotropic magnetic dipole acts as an order parameter for antiferromagnets that exhibit the anomalous Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Exchange Surface Spin Waves in Type-A van der Waals Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhoujian Sun, Fuxiang Li, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Ping Tang</p>
            <p>Surface spin waves in the short-wavelength regime enable ultrafast, nanoscale magnon-based devices. Here we report the emergence of surface spin-wave excitations within the bulk magnon band gap of type-A van der Waals antiferromagnets composed of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic monolayers. In contrast to the magnetostatic Damon-Eshbach modes in magnetic slabs, these surface waves are pure exchange modes owing to the reduced interlayer exchange coupling at surface layers, and thus persist in ultrathin multilayer stacks and at large wave numbers. We show that they can be efficiently excited by electromagnetic waves, with absorption power comparable to or even exceeding that of bulk modes. Moreover, their magnetic stray fields exhibit pronounced even-odd oscillations with the number of monolayers that should be observable by NV-center magnetometry.</p>

            <h2>Topological classification and edge states of magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwen wang, Qiutong Wang, Qingjun Tong, Ci Li</p>
            <p>We study the topological classification and related edge states of magnons in ferromagnets on honeycomb that can be described by a class of single-particle bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) models. Both single layer and bilayer situations are considered. The calculations show that the existence and related topologies of these edge states are well captured by a class of non-Hermitian single or coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains models H(ky) parameterized by momentum ky, where the edge states can appear as the ground state for some cases. Interestingly, although the eigenproblem of bosonic BdG models is equivalent to the one of non-Hermitian systems, the conventional bulkedge correspondence for Hermitian systems is partially valid. The influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next nearest-neighbor spins are also discussed, which break the time-reversal symmetry and lead to a straight connection between edge states for magnonic systems and non-zero Chern number of non-Hermitian bulk two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic Band Dispersions and an Evidence of Cooperon Excitations in a Spin-$1/2$ Trimer Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Srikanth Patnaik, Snehasish Sen, A. K. Bera, Sudhansu S. Mandal, Anushree Roy, S.M. Yusuf</p>
            <p>We obtain the solution of the Hamiltonian of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin-$1/2$ trimer chain in terms of three bands that host three different species of fermions. While the lowest two bands correspond to spin-$1/2$ fermions, the fermions in the highest band are of spin-$3/2$. Because the bands are for different species of fermions, the particle-hole excitation channel across the bands is closed. However, fractionalized excitations as spin-$1/2$ and spin-$3/2$ fermions in pairs open a cooperon channel of excitations in Raman scattering. The background spectral intensity profile obtained by Raman scattering measurements in Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_4$O$_{12}$ having a trimer chain consisting of spin-$1/2$ Cu ions, has comprehensively been shown to be consistent with these excitations.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and trimers on attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Pilé, Evgeni Burovski</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste de Vaulx, Quintin N. Meier, Pierre Toulemonde, Andrés Cano, Valerio Olevano</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions</h2>

            <p>Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient strength (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</p>

            <h2>Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bishnu Karki, Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Attaining superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) beyond the limit around 14 K observed thus far in spinel compounds AB2X4 (A, B = transition metals, X = O/chalcogen) could elucidate interaction intricacies and inform materials design. This work spotlights CuIr2S4, which exhibits a distinct metal-insulator transition below 230 K, as an unconventional candidate for activation under high pressure. Through transport, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments conducted at pressures up to 224 GPa, we unveil pressure-tuning that suppressed CuIr2S4's transition, yielding two superconducting phases with an un-precedented Tc for spinels. Initially, 3.8 K onset rose monotonically, reaching 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Unexpectedly, a distinct phase with Tc = 2.2 K distinctly emerged at higher pressures, intimating unconventional couplings. Our findings suggest that both geometric frustration and electron-electron interactions play crucial roles in the superconductivity observed in CuIr2S4. The findings stretch perceived temperature limits in spinels and provide structure-property insights to guide the optimiza-tion of quantum materials interactions for tailored targeted functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal Shavit, Jason Alicea</p>
            <p>Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.</p>

            <h2>Exact joint distributions of three global characteristic times for Brownian motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We consider three global characteristic times for a one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(\tau)$ in the interval $\tau\in [0,t]$: the occupation time $t_{\rm o}$ denoting the cumulative time where $x(\tau)>0$, the time $t_{\rm m}$ at which the process achieves its global maximum in $[0,t]$ and the last-passage time $t_l$ through the origin before $t$. All three random variables have the same marginal distribution given by Lévy's arcsine law. We compute exactly the pairwise joint distributions of these three times and show that they are quite different from each other. The joint distributions display rather rich and nontrivial correlations between these times. Our analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Square skyrmion lattice in multiorbital $f$-electron systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Zha, Satoru Hayami</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.</p>

            <p>We present a tunable plasmonic platform that allows room temperature hybridization of dissimilar excitons, namely of Wannier-Mott excitons in monolayer (1L) WS2 and Frenkel excitons in molecular J-aggregates via simultaneous strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons. It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature $T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below $T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.</p>

            <h2>Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ned Thaddeus Taylor, Michael Thomas Morgan, Steven Paul Hepplestone</p>
            <p>This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics of nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in determining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the behaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these perovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and results are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results from these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites - the undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2 surface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by the phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO surface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies at the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich conditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2 surface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form, the BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more suitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the understanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which will aid in surface growth and manufacturing.</p>

KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs 30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal density (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and hardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs 0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed through predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of NASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for new, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting simulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than equally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic moduli.</p>

            <h2>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher N. Angstmann, Daniel S. Han, Bruce I. Henry, Boris Z. Huang, Zhuang Xu</p>
            <p>The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Time Crystal in a Spin Maser System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiyu Wang, Mingjun Feng, Qianjin Ma, Zi Cai, Erwei Li, Guobin Liu</p>
            <p>Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking. This time crystal phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced time crystal is closer to the idea of crystal, compared to other time crystal realizations.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection</h2>

            <p>We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing light emission with electric fields in polar nitride semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick Pant, Rob Armitage, Emmanouil Kioupakis</p>
            <p>Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle Monkman, Mona Berciu</p>
            <p>While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described accurately by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this also extends to other coupling strengths. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths to gauge the validity of the Lindblad dynamics during a finite time evolution, and show that for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics generally only holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also prove that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.</p>

Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donggang Cao, Gilad Yossifon</p>
            <p>Active (self-propelling) particles have emerged as innovative microscale tools in the field of single cell analysis with the advantages of being untethered, remotely controlled, hybrid powered, with sub-cellular precision. This study investigates the dielectrophoretic (DEP) response and electro-mechanical deformation of cell nuclei interacting with active metallo-dielectric Janus Particles (JPs) under an externally applied electric field. An equivalent droplet two-phase model is employed to simulate the bioparticle, coupling the Navier-Stokes equations with the Phase Field Model to capture fluid motion and interface dynamics. Good qualitative agreement is obtained among experimental, analytical, and numerical results. The findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between nucleus deformation and its surface coverage of the JP with respect to the applied voltage. The overall coverage ratio of the JP dielectric hemisphere increases with voltage as the positive DEP force on the dielectric side strengthens, exhibiting maximum at a certain voltage. The strong correlation between nucleus flexibility and JP surface coverage suggests that the JP coverage ratio could serve as a biomechanical marker for nucleus deformability, providing a novel method for in-situ evaluation of nucleus mechanics.</p>

            <p>We consider a model of hard-core bosons on a lattice, half-filling a Chern band such that the system has a continuous transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a superfluid state (SF) depending on the bandwidth to bandspacing ratio. We construct a parton-inspired trial wavefunction ansatz for the ground states that has remarkably high overlap with exact diagonalization in both phases and throughout the phase transition. Our ansatz is stable to adding some bosonic interactions beyond the on-site hard core constraint. We confirm that the transition is well described by a projective translation symmetry-protected multiple parton band gap closure, as has been previously predicted. However, unlike prior work, we find that our wavefunctions require anomalous (BCS-like) parton correlations to describe the phase transition and SF phase accurately.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann</p>
            <p>We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of ``double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</p>

            <h2>Gyrotropic magnetic effect in metallic chiral magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisarga Paul, Takamori Park, Jung Hoon Han, Leon Balents</p>
            <p>We study the gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), the low-frequency limit of optical gyrotropy, in metals and semimetals coupled to chiral spin textures. In these systems, the chiral spin texture which lacks inversion symmetry can imprint itself upon the electronic structure through Hund's coupling, leading to novel low-frequency optical activity. Using perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of both relativistic and non-relativistic models of conduction electrons coupled to spin textures, we analyze how the GME manifests in both single-$q$ and multi-$q$ textures. Analytical expressions for the rotatory power are derived in terms of universal scaling functions. Estimates based on realistic material parameters reveal an experimentally viable range of values for the rotatory power. The GME arises from the orbital and spin magnetic moments of conduction electrons, with the orbital part closely tied to Berry curvature and playing a significant role in relativistic metals but not so in non-relativistic metals where there is no inherent Berry curvature. The spin contribution to the GME can be significant in non-relativistic metals with a large Fermi energy. Our work establishes the GME as a sensitive probe of magnetic chirality and symmetry breaking in metallic chiral magnets.</p>

            <p>Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.</p>

            <p>Unconventional superconductors have specific signatures in their magnetic properties, such as intrinsic magnetization at interfaces and around defects and fractional and multiquanta vortices, with much attention focused on heavy fermion and high-T_c superconductors. Here we report an observation of highly anomalous magnetization in a candidate topological superconductor beta-PdBi2, a layered material where hidden inversion symmetry breaking leads to spin polarization and spin-momentum locking of the electronic bands. We observe strictly linear, non-hysteretic dc magnetization, a transition to sharply reduced ac susceptibility vs the magnetic field H applied parallel to the ab plane, and a strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane H. Based on our earlier finding of a magnetic-field induced phase transition from s-wave to nodal p-wave superconductivity in the tunnelling spectra of PdBi2, we propose that this unusual behavior can be explained by a transition from a conventional vortex structure in low-H s-wave phase to a domain structure corresponding to spatial phase separation into superconducting (nodal p-wave) and normal domains, identifying new features of magnetization that can arise from the multiplicity of superconducting phases.</p>

            <p>Routine investigations of plasmonic phenomena at the quantum level present a formidable computational challenge due to the large system sizes and ultrafast timescales involved. This Feature Article highlights the use of density functional tight-binding (DFTB), particularly its real-time time-dependent formulation (RT-TDDFTB), as a tractable approach to study plasmonic nanostructures from a purely quantum mechanical purview. We begin by outlining the theoretical framework and limitations of DFTB, emphasizing its efficiency in modeling systems with thousands of atoms over picosecond timescales. Applications of RT-TDDFTB are then explored in the context of optical absorption, nonlinear harmonic generation, and plasmon-mediated photocatalysis. We demonstrate how DFTB can reconcile classical and quantum descriptions of plasmonic behavior, capturing key phenomena such as size-dependent plasmon shifts and plasmon coupling in nanoparticle assemblies. Finally, we showcase DFTB's ability to model hot carrier generation and reaction dynamics in plasmon-driven \ch{H2} dissociation, underscoring its potential to model photocatalytic processes. Collectively, these studies establish DFTB as a powerful, yet computationally efficient tool to probe the emergent physics of materials at the limits of space and time.</p>

            <p>We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -yet never crossing- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.</p>

            <p>The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic method used for optimization problems. Although not a machine learning method per se, ACO is often employed alongside machine learning models to enhance performance through optimization. We adapt an ACO algorithm to optimize the so-called FVC density functional for the ground-state energy of strongly correlated systems. We find the parameter configurations that maximize optimization efficiency, while reducing the mean relative error ($MRE$) of the ACO functional. We then analyze the algorithm's performance across different dimensionalities ($1D-5D$), which are related to the number of parameters to be optimized within the FVC functional. Our results indicate that $15$ ants with a pheromone evaporation rate superior to $0.2$ are sufficient to minimize the $MRE$ for a vast regime of parameters of the strongly-correlated system -- interaction, particle density and spin magnetization. While the optimizations $1D$, $2D$, and $4D$ yield $1.5\%< MRE< 2.7\%$, the $3D$ and $5D$ optimizations lower the $MRE$ to $\sim0.8\%$, reflecting a $67\%$ error reduction compared to the original FVC functional ($MRE = 2.4\%$). As simulation time grows almost linearly with dimension, our results highlight the potential of ant colony algorithms for density-functional problems, combining effectiveness with low computational cost.</p>

            <p>The "Poor Man's Majoranas" (PMMs) [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection can "spill over" from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin $S$. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling $J$, solely the half $2S+1$ $(2S+2)$ of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) $S.$ Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity $2S+1$ holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by $J$ becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.</p>

            <p>We study the Josephson effect in SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnets (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the Josephson critical current displays periodic resonance peaks as exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, provided a potential barrier exists at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface. These resonance peaks emerge under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)}d_{1(2)}=\left(n_{1(2)}+1/2\right)\pi$. Here, $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ represents a center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. This critical current feature arises from a resonant tunneling effect induced by spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis. At resonance, the Josephson current primarily originates from the first harmonic in both parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations, whereas the second harmonic becomes more significant in perpendicular configurations. In cases where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while maintaining it in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic theoretical study on the structural and electronic properties of twisted trilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$, where two independent moiré patterns form between adjacent layers. Using a continuum approach, we investigate the optimized lattice structure and the resulting energy band structure, revealing fundamentally different electronic behaviors between helical and alternating twist configurations. In helical trilayers, lattice relaxation induces $\alpha\beta$ and $\beta\alpha$ domains, where the two moiré patterns shift to minimize overlap, while in alternating trilayers, $\alpha\alpha'$ domains emerge with aligned moiré patterns. A key feature of trilayer TMDs is the summation of moiré potentials from the top and bottom layers onto the middle layer, effectively doubling the potential depth. In helical trilayers, this mechanism generates a Kagome lattice potential in the $\alpha\beta$ domains, giving rise to flat bands characteristic of Kagome physics. In alternating trilayers, the enhanced potential confinement forms deep triangular quantum wells, distinct from those found in bilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moderate perpendicular electric field can switch the layer polarization near the valence band edge, providing an additional degree of tunability. In particular, it enables tuning of the hybridization between orbitals on different layers, allowing for the engineering of diverse and controllable electronic band structures. Our findings highlight the unique role of moiré potential summation in trilayer systems, offering a broader platform for designing moiré-based electronic and excitonic phenomena beyond those achievable in bilayer TMDs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Wang, Zhenbo Wang, Jiaqi Liu, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>The key concept of mobility edge, which marks the critical transition between extended and localized states in energy domain, has attracted significant interest in the cutting-edge frontiers of modern physics due to its profound implications for understanding localization and transport properties in disordered systems. However, a generic way to construct multiple mobility edges (MME) is still ambiguous and lacking. In this work, we propose a brief scheme to engineer both real and complex exact multiple mobility edges exploiting a few coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains. We study the extended-localized transitions of coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains along the chain direction. The model combines both the well-established quasiperiodicity and a kind of freshly introduced staggered non-reciprocity, which are aligned in two mutually perpendicular directions, within a unified framework. Based on analytical analysis, we predict that when the couplings between quasiperiodic chains are weak, the system will be in a mixed phase in which the localized states and extended states coexist and intertwine, thus lacking explicit energy separations. However, as the inter-chain couplings increase to certain strength, exact multiple mobility edges emerge. This prediction is clearly verified by concrete numerical calculations of the Fractal Dimension and the scaling index $\beta$. Moreover, we show that the combination of quasiperiodicity and the staggered non-reciprocity can be utilized to design and realize quantum states of various configurations. Our results reveal a brief and general scheme to implement exact multiple mobility edges for synthetic materials engineering.</p>

            <p>Evolution of composite spin-orbital order and coupled spin-orbital excitations is studied in a variety of $d^4$ systems with $n$=$4$ electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbital sector using the generalised self-consistent + fluctuations approach for a realistic interacting-electron model. Within this unified approach, applications are discussed to compounds with $3d$, $4d$, $5d$ transition-metal ions such as $\rm BaFeO_3$ ($\rm Fe^{4+}$), $\rm Ca_2RuO_4$ ($\rm Ru^{4+}$), $\rm Sr_2RuO_4$ ($\rm Ru^{4+}$), $\rm Sr_2YIrO_6$ ($\rm Ir^{5+}$), and $\rm K_2OsCl_6$ ($\rm Os^{4+}$). Continuous interpolation from the nominally $S=1$ antiferromagnetic order in $\rm Ca_2RuO_4$ (strong crystal field, intermediate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interaction) to the $J=0$ state relevant for $5d^4$ compounds (strong SOC, weak Coulomb interaction) and to the half-metallic ferromagnetic order when crystal field is negligible as in $\rm BaFeO_3$ (weak SOC, strong Coulomb interaction) and $\rm Sr_2RuO_4$ (intermediate SOC and Coulomb interaction) provides new fundamental insights into the magnetism of spin-orbit coupled systems.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistency error correction for accurate machine learning potentials from variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.</p>

            <h2>Laser-induced modulation of the ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase fraction in FeRh films</h2>

            <p>With his huge entropy change and a strong interplay between magnetic order, structural and electrical properties, the first-order antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition is a paradigmatic example of the multicaloric effect. The unraveling of the physics underlying the phase transition needs a better understanding of the thermal hysteresis of FeRh within the AF-FM phase coexistence region. In this work, we compare the effect of two very different types of thermal cycling on the hysteresis of the magnetic order: quasi-static heating, and cooling of the entire 195 nm thick film, and a f =100 kHz modulated heating driven by a laser focused down to a spot of about ten micron squared at the film surface. Taking advantage of the reflectivity difference between both phases to probe optically their respective fraction, we show that whereas only temperature-driven reflectivity variations (dR/dT , thermoreflectance) are detected in the pure phases, a huge modulation of the phase-dependent reflectance at the driving frequency f is detected in the phase coexistence temperature range. This is quantitatively described as resulting from a substantial modulation of the FM fraction (up to 90%) with increasing laser power. A simplified rate-independent hysteresis model with return-point-memory (RPM), represented in terms of bistable units that undergo a temperature excursion corresponding to a given laser power, reproduces very well the optically measured FM phase modulation characteristics for a broad range of temperature excursions. This offers an insight into the leading role of quenched disorder in defining thermal hysteresis in FeRh under high excitation frequency, when the material is periodically driven out-of-equilibrium.</p>

We calculate the exchange and anisotropy constants in our spin model by first principles. We can accurately explain the transition from a collinear to a canted ground state for a magnetic field applied normal to the (in-plane) easy-axis, and a spin-flop transition when the field is parallel to it. A topologically protected Dirac nodal line is present and robust with respect to both external and anisotropy fields.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits based on semiconductor quantum dots are a promising prospect for quantum computation because of their high coherence times and gate fidelities. However, scaling up those structures to the numbers required by fault-tolerant quantum computing is currently hampered by a number of issues. One of the main issues is the need for single-shot low-footprint qubit readout. Here, we demonstrate the single-shot in situ measurement of a compact qubit unit-cell. The unit cell is composed of two electron spins with a controllable exchange interaction. We report initialization, single-shot readout and two-electron entangling gate. The unit cell was successfully operated at up to 1 K, with state-of-the-art charge noise levels extracted using free induction decay. With its integrated readout and high stability, this foundry fabricated qubit unit cell demonstrates strong potential for scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Collapse of molecular orbital by ultrahigh magnetic fields in V$_6$O$_{13}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuto Ishii, Akihiko Ikeda, Yasuhiro. H. Matsuda</p>
            <p>V$_6$O$_{13}$ exhibits the metal-insulator transition (MIT) with vanadium-vanadium (V-V) dimer formation. The magnetostriction of V$_6$O$_{13}$ along the crystallographic $b$-axis has been measured in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 186 T at several temperatures in this work. The large negative magnetostriction as large as $\Delta L / L \sim10^{-3}$ was observed above 110 T below the transition temperature. Discussion based on experimental results and the physical property of V$_6$O$_{13}$ suggests that the observed large negative magnetostriction corresponds to the collapse of V-V dimer molecular orbital (MO). This is the first case for direct observation of lattice change originating from the magnetic field-induced collapse of V-V dimer MO in vanadium oxides. In addition, the $B$-$T$ phase diagram and the magnitude of magnetostriction indicate that the collapse of V-V dimer MO probably accompanies the insulator-to-metal transition. A large hysteresis that is larger than 50 T was observed, which probably arises from the non-equilibrated cross-correlation of such degrees of freedom as the charge, spin, and lattice. Comparison with the VO$_2$ case suggests the magnetic entropy of the remanent paramagnetic spins in the insulating phase may play an important role for the MIT in V$_6$O$_{13}$.</p>

            <p>Guided by experiments contrasting electrically accelerated recovery with natural healing, this study formulates a model to investigate the importance of electroactive differential growth and morphological changes in tissue repair. It underscores the clinical potential of leveraging electroactive differential growth for improved healing outcomes. The study reveals that voltage stimulation significantly enhances the healing and growth of biological tissues, accelerating the regeneration process across various growth modalities and steering towards isotropic growth conditions that do not favor any specific growth pathways. Enhancing the electroelastic coupling parameters improves the efficacy of bioelectric devices, initiating contraction and fortification of biological tissues in alignment with the electric field. This process facilitates swift cell migration and proliferation, as well as oriented growth of tissue. In instances of strain stiffening at elevated strains, the extreme critical growth ratio aligns with the predictions of neo-Hookean models. Conversely, for tissues experiencing strain stiffening under moderate to very low strain conditions, the strain stiffening effect substantially delays the onset of electroelastic growth instability, ultimately producing a smooth, hyperelastic surface devoid of any unstable morphologies. Our investigation, grounded in nonlinear electroelastic field and perturbation theories, explores how electric fields influence differential growth and instability in biological tissues. We examine the interactions among dimensionless voltage, internal pressure, electroelastic coupling, radius ratio, and strain stiffening, revealing their effects on promoting growth and delaying instability. This framework offers insights into the mechanisms behind electroactive growth and its instabilities, contributing valuable knowledge to the tissue healing.</p>

            <p>Developing electrode materials with exceptional electrical conductivity, robust chemical stability, rapid charge and discharge rates, and high storage capacity is essential for advancing high-performance metal-ion batteries. This study explores the two-dimensional, 18-crown-6-like N8 structure (2D-N8) as a promising electrode material for next-generation rechargeable post-lithium batteries. We thoroughly investigated the pristine N8 structures, focusing on their stability and performance metrics. Our analysis revealed remarkable structural stability across the board. Additionally, electronic calculations indicated a small band gap of 0.54 eV for the N8 monolayer, suggesting favorable electronic properties for battery applications. When we evaluated a series of metal ions as adsorbates, we found that the pristine N8 monolayer achieved an impressive storage capacity of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) ions, highlighting its potential for effective ion storage. Our findings suggest that the engineered 2D-N8 structure offers a unique combination of stability and electrochemical performance that could significantly contribute to developing efficient and durable energy storage technologies.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics converts chiral flagellar rotation into contactless actuation of microdiscs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Grober, Tanumoy Dhar, David Saintillan, Jérémie Palacci</p>
            <p>Motile bacteria are a wonder of nature's engineering: microscopic engines that transduce biochemical energy into the work they require to explore their environment. This added energy turns the surrounding fluid into a bath that departs from an equilibrium one. Bacterial baths agitate suspended spheres more vividly than thermal fluctuations and can power microscopic ratchets. A salient requirement to extract work from bacterial baths was the asymmetric shape of the ratchets, designed to rectify the interactions with bacteria. In contrast with past results, here we show that swimming E. coli power the persistent rotation of discs, in absence of asymmetry. Combining state-of-the art nanoprinting, quantitative measurements of the dynamics of individual bacteria, and hydrodynamic modeling, we elucidate the mechanism and show that the counter-rotation of the flagella and the bacterium body lead to a torque dipole and traction onto the disc, and subsequent rotation. Remarkably, the mechanism is independent of the direction or orientation of navigation of bacteria under the disc, hence additive and contactless. Resulting from the interplay of the torque dipole of flagellated bacteria with simple geometric confinement, this hydrodynamic mechanism bridges scales, leveraging the chirality of bacteria nanomotors towards the manipulation of objects at least ten thousand times larger. The study lays the groundwork for novel bio-hybrid micromachines that harness living microorganisms for controlled motion at the microscale. Our findings provide further fundamental insights into bacterial hydrodynamics and open avenues for the development of autonomous, self-powered microdiscs for the study of chiral fluids.</p>

            <p>We have performed confocal microscopy experiments and computer simulations of colloidal suspensions with moderate volume fraction confined between two quasi-parallel, rough walls [A. Villada-Balbuena et al., Soft Matter, 2022, 18, 4699-4714]. Here we investigate many facets of the dynamical properties of the system, such as confined and inhomogeneous diffusion, mean first-passage times and generalized incoherent scattering functions. We observe that the experiment features strong footprints of the confinement in the dynamical properties, such as inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients and non-zero off-diagonal elements in the incoherent scattering function which we can quantitatively model and analyze with computer simulations. This allows us, for example, to systematically investigate the impact of surface roughness. Our comparative study therefore advances the fundamental understanding of the impact of confinement on dynamics in fluids and colloidal suspensions.</p>

            <h2>Microcanonical ensemble out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Belousov, Jenna Elliott, Florian Berger, Lamberto Rondoni, Anna Erzberger</p>
            <p>Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems in and out of equilibrium. While the latter generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories--all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed macro- and microscopic constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations underlying the theories of random walks and stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our theory highlights differences between nonequilibrium regimes not evident in the traditional formulation of the maximum-caliber principle. We validate our results by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics, which are critical for investigating systems where the conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of white-noise disorder on the local phase stiffness and thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor. Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral formalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting order parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant manner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to derive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems. Solving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we calculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder strengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength, which becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder strength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed throughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$ increases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may indicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence of a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures.</p>

            <p>Extracting the Hamiltonian of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in correlated quantum matter. Here we put forward a machine learning strategy to extract the spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows to directly extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the different exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that can be used to predict the Hamiltonian of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable learning a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption analysis through an integrated workflow for isotherm fitting, heat of adsorption estimation, mixture prediction, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM's intuitive GUI requires no coding and supports a broad isotherm library (e.g., Langmuir, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov, Structural-Transition-Adsorption). It also enables non-isothermal breakthrough simulations with axial dispersion. Case studies, such as Xe/Kr breakthrough curves in SBMOF-1, closely match the results from other software applications, such as RUPTURA. Mixture predictions can be done using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) and Extended Langmuir models, while isosteric heats are derived from Clausius-Clapeyron or Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners.</p>

            <p>We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates.

In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.</p>

            <p>Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</p>

            <p>We compute the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined on a curved surface and unravel the effects of curvatures. Starting with a general formulation for any smooth surface, we apply it to a prolate ellipsoid, which is inspired by recent bubble trap experiments. Using a perturbative approach to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and a general Ansatz, followed by a dimensional reduction, we derive an effective two-dimensional equation that includes a curvature-dependent geometric potential. We compute the ground state using Thomas-Fermi approximation and, for an isotropic confinement, we find that the highest accumulation of atoms happens on the regions with the greatest difference between the principal curvatures. For a prolate ellipsoid, this accumulation happens on the equator, which is contrary to previous findings that describe accumulation on the poles of a bubble trap. Finally, we explain the reasons for this difference: the higher accumulation of atoms on the poles happens due to anisotropies in the confinement, while the higher accumulation on the equator happens exclusively due to the geometric properties of the surface.</p>

            <p>Thanks to their excellent properties of low cost, lightweight, portability, and conformity, flexible perovskite-based tandem solar cells show great potentials for energy harvesting applications, with flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem solar cells particularly promising for achieving high efficiency. However, performance of flexible perovskite/c-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells still greatly lags, due to challenges in simultaneously achieving both efficient photocarrier transport and reliable mitigation of residual stress. Here, we reveal the critical role of perovskite phase homogeneity, for achieving high-efficient and mechanical-stable flexible perovskite/c-silicon heterojunction monolithic tandem solar cells (PSTs) with textured surface. Through ensuring high phase homogeneity, which promotes charge transfer across all facets of the pyramid on the textured substrates and releases the residual stress at the perovskite/c-silicon interface, we demonstrate flexible PSTs with a bending curvature of 0.44 cm-1, and a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.88% (1.04 cm2 aperture area), surpassing all other types of flexible perovskite-based photovoltaic devices.

            <p>We perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations to explore the self-assembly of a two-dimensional model system of triblock Janus colloids as an example of "patchy" colloids forming complex structures. Previous experiments and simulation studies have shown that such systems are capable of forming a two-dimensional Kagome lattice at room temperatures. However, it is well established that the crystallization is strongly hampered by the formation of long-living metastable aggregates. For this reason, recent studies have investigated activity, i.e., self-propulsion of the Janus particles as a mechanism to accelerate the formation of stable Kagome structures [Mallory and Cacciuto, JACS 141, 2500-2507 (2019)] at selected state points. Here we extend, first, the investigations of active Janus colloids for a broader range of densities and temperatures. We also characterize in detail the associated nucleation of Kagome clusters, as well as their structure in the steady state. Second, to make contact to the equilibrium case, we propose a simple activity time protocol where an initially chosen activity is switched off after a finite time. With this protocol, we not only find Kagome structures in a much broader range of densities than in the purely passive case, but also obtain a Kagome crystallization boundary very close to that proposed in earlier Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>The specific heat anomaly stems from a third-order phase transition in the 2D lattice sine-Gordon model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Loris Di Cairano, Alexandre Tkatchenko</p>
            <p>The specific heat anomaly (SHA) is broadly observed in statistical mechanics, appearing as a smooth, system-size-independent peak in the specific heat, in contrast to the singular behavior typical of second-order phase transitions (PTs). Its origin remains heavily debated: some attribute it to finite-size effects, others to unidentified phase transitions. Here we investigate SHA using the two-dimensional sine-Gordon (2D-sG) model and microcanonical inflection point analysis (MIPA), uncovering two key results. First, we show that the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT under MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous. This clarifies the ambiguity in the literature, where this transition was often, though inconclusively, attributed to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Through the use of MIPA and a comprehensive analysis of standard thermodynamic observables, we provide a coherent thermodynamic characterization that redefines the nature of this transition. Second, we find that the SHA is not itself a PT but rather the thermodynamic fingerprint of this third-order transition. These findings clarify the nature of SHA within the 2D-sG model and suggest that similar anomalies in other systems, such as the XY model, may likewise originate from third-order PTs, rather than mere crossovers. Our results provide a consistent thermodynamic interpretation of the SHA and highlight the broader relevance of third-order transitions in systems previously thought to exhibit only low-order or crossover transition.</p>

            <h2>Upper critical field and pairing symmetry of Ising superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lena Engström, Ludovica Zullo, Tristan Cren, Andrej Mesaros, Pascal Simon</p>
            <p>Motivated by the fact that the measured critical field $H_c$ in various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors is poorly understood, we reexamine its scaling behavior with temperature and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By computing the spin-susceptibility in a multipocket system, we find that segments of the Fermi Surface (FS) at which the SOC has nodal points can have a contribution orders of magnitude larger than the remaining FS, hence setting the $H_c$, assuming the presence of a conventional singlet superconducting order parameter. Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed by symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS pocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in gated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements, concluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is consistent with the $H_c(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in contrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we show that the theory is also consistent with data on homobilayer TMDs.</p>

            <h2>Critical clusters in liquid crystals: Fractal geometry and conformal invariance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renan A. L. Almeida, Jeferson J. Arenzon</p>
            <p>We study the two-dimensional domain morphology of twisted nematic liquid crystals during their phase-ordering kinetics [R. A. L. Almeida, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 (2023) 268101], which is a physical candidate to self-generate critical clusters in the percolation universality class. Here we present experimental evidence that large clusters and their hulls are indeed both fractals with dimensions of the corresponding figures in critical percolation models. The asymptotic decay of a crossing probability, from a region in the vicinity of the origin to the boundary of disks, is described by the Lawler-Schramm-Werner theorem provided that a microscopic length in the original formulation is replaced by the coarsening length of the liquid crystal. Furthermore, the behavior for the winding angle of large loops is, at certain scales, compatible with that of Schramm-Loewner evolution curves with diffusivity $\kappa = 6$. These results show an experimental realization of critical clusters in phase ordering.</p>

            <h2>Vibrational Energy Dissipation in Non-Contact Single-Molecule Junctions Governed by Local Geometry and Electronic Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Hörmann, Reinhard J. Maurer</p>
            <p>The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akhil S. Nair, Lucas Foppa, Matthias Scheffler</p>
            <p>Materials databases built from calculations based on density functional approximations play an important role in the discovery of materials with improved properties. Most databases thus constructed rely on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for electron exchange and correlation. This limits the reliability of these databases, as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on them, for certain classes of materials and properties which are not well described by GGA. In this paper, we describe a database of 7,024 inorganic materials presenting diverse structures and compositions generated using hybrid functional calculations enabled by their efficient implementation in the all-electron code FHI-aims. The database is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of oxides relevant to catalysis and energy related applications. We illustrate how the database can be used to train AI models for material properties using the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) approach.</p>

            <p>The role of doping in tailoring thermal transport in semiconductors is critical for efficient thermal management in electronic devices. While the effects of doping have been extensively studied to tune electrical properties, its impact on thermal transport has not yet been thoroughly explored, particularly with respect to experimental investigations into exceptionally strong non-Rayleigh defect-phonon scattering phenomena. Herein, by combining the high-quality growth and advanced characterizations of cubic silicon carbide single crystals with well controlled boron doping, we experimentally observe anomalous strong defect-phonon scatterings, among the strongest reported in common semiconductors, that exceeds the predictions of the classic mass difference model by tens of times in magnitude. The measured thermal conductivity of doped 3C SiC match excellently with those predicted by first principle calculations in which resonant scattering of low frequency phonon is considered. Our findings not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of defect-phonon interactions and will also impact applications such as thermal management of electronics.</p>

            <p>The exploration of the superconductivity in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant attention due to their promising low-power applications and fundamental scientific interest. Here, we report some novel stable non-van der Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk exfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles calculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P \overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting transition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed analysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by phonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon coupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by pronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps. These results advance our understanding of superconductivity in 2D transition metal nitride and highlight their potential for nanoscale superconducting applications.</p>

            <p>Kagome lattice decorated with S=1/2 spins is one of the most discussed ways to realize a quantum spin liquid. However, all previous material realizations of this model have suffered from additional complications, ranging from additional interactions to impurity effects. Recently, a new quantum kagome system has been identified in the form of averievite Cu(5-x)ZnxV2O10(CsCl), featuring a unique double-layer spacing between the kagome planes. Using muon spin spectroscopy we show that only a complete substitution (i.e. $x=2$) of interplanar copper ions leads to a quantum-disordered ground state. In contrast, the parent compound ($x=0$) exhibits long-range magnetic order, with a phase transition around 24 K. Experiments performed on the partially substituted material ($x=1$) show that the transformation proceeds through an intermediate disordered, partially frozen ground state, unaffected by pressures up to 23 kbar. Our study provides a microscopic view of the magnetism of the decoupling of the kagome layers and establishes the averievite as a new material platform for the experimental study of the fully-decoupled kagome layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ran Ding, Daniel Maldonado-Lopez, Jacob E. Henebry, Jose Mendoza-Cortes, Michael J. Zdilla</p>
            <p>Few-layered potassium nickel and cobalt oxides show drastic differences in catalytic activity based on metal ion preorganization. Uniform compositions $[(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6$ or $(\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ show limited activity, while homogenously-mixed-metal cobalt/nickel oxides $[(\mathrm{Co}_n\mathrm{Ni}_{1-n}\mathrm{O}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ display moderate improvement. However, a layer-by-layer arrangement of cobalt and nickel oxide sheets [e.g., $(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})$] provides superior catalytic performance, reducing the oxygen evolution overpotential by more than 400 mV. Density functional theory simulations provide an illustration of the electronic properties (density of states and localization of orbitals) that promote catalysis in the layer-segregated materials over those of homogeneous composition. This study reveals that atomic preorganization of metal ions within layered catalysts plays a more crucial role than overall metal composition in enhancing catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic interpretation to Stochastic Fisher Information and Single-Trajectory Speed Limits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro B. Melo, Fernando Iemini, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto, Sílvio M. Duarte Queirós, Welles A. M. Morgado</p>
            <p>The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a geometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility of computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the trajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher information (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we discuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI is and (ii) whether there are any trajectory-level thermodynamic bounds due to the SFI. We find that, contrary to previous results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the thermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive single-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian particle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a decreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds one can derive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the one derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted models and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and that the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similarly to the average and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving velocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not saturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations at the trajectory level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Martin, Tapan Chandra Adhyapak, Holger Stark</p>
            <p>Motility is fundamental to the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. The E. coli bacterium propels itself using a bundle of rotating helical flagella. If one flagellum reverses its rotational direction, it leaves the bundle, performs a polymorphic transformation, and the bacterium tumbles. The E. coli bacterium is hydrodynamically attracted to surfaces. This prolongs its residence time, while tumbling facilitates surface detachment. We develop a model of E. coli that uses an extended Kirchhoff rod theory to implement flagellar flexibility as well as different polymorphic conformations and perform hydrodynamic simulations with the method of multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD). To establish a reference case, we determine the distribution of tumble angles in the bulk fluid, which shows good agreement with experiments for a fixed tumble time. Increasing the hook stiffness, narrows the tumble angle distribution and reduces the flagellar dispersion during tumbling. Close to a bounding surface, the tumble angle distribution is shifted to smaller angles, while flagellar dispersion is reduced. Reorientation within the plane favors the forward direction, which might be an explanation for prolonged run times observed in experiments</p>

            <p>$\mathrm{B}$ site ordered $5d^2$ double perovskites ($\mathrm{A_2BB'O_6,\ B'}=5d^2)$ display a remarkable range of physical properties upon variation of the chosen $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{B'}$ site ions. This sensitivity to chemical substitution reflects the delicate balance and profound impact of strong electronic correlation and spin-orbit coupling in such systems. We present rhenium $L_2$ and $L_3$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of two such physically dissimilar materials, Mott-insultating $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ and semiconducting $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$. Despite these differences, our RIXS results reveal similar energy scales of Hund's ($J_H$) and spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda$) in the two materials, with both systems firmly in the intermediate Hund's coupling regime ($\mathcal{O}(J_H/\lambda)\sim 1$). However, there are clear differences in their RIXS spectra. The conductive character of $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$ broadens and obfuscates the atomic transitions within an electron-hole continuum, while the insulating character of $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ results in sharp atomic excitations. This contrast in their RIXS spectra despite their similar energy scales reflects a difference in the itinerancy-promoting hopping integral and illustrates the impact of the local crystal environment in double perovskites. Finally, $L_2$ and $L_3$ edge analyses of the atomic excitations in $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ reveal that the energy scales of Hund's and spin-orbit coupling are in fact inverted compared to previously reported values. We present exact diagonalization calculations of the RIXS spectra at both edges which show good agreement with our results for new energy scales of $\lambda=0.290(5)$ eV and $J_H=0.38(2)$ eV ($J_H/\lambda=1.30(5)$).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasser Almoteri, Enkeleida Lushi</p>
            <p>We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective chemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The Brinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the presence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an environment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the linearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of collective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities. We present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can expect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for varying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic coupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that resistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it inhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective swimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions, we find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the swimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and collectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show simulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the phase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the experimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental realizations of this system.</p>

            <p>Precise control over surface chemistry is essential for tuning interfacial behavior in technologies ranging from catalysis and protective coatings to energy conversion systems. Although chemical functionalization of alpha-quartz (alpha-SiO2) with hydroxyl (OH) and methyl (CH3) groups has been extensively studied, the impact of their spatial distribution at the atomic scale remains largely uncharted. In this work, we integrate density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate how different arrangements of OH/CH3 groups modulate surface properties. Our results reveal that spatial patterning governs the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks, alters vibrational signatures, and has a significant influence on the thermodynamic stability of the functionalized surfaces. The MLFF framework enables high-fidelity simulations at unprecedented scales, bridging the gap between quantum accuracy and statistical sampling. By uncovering structure-property relationships inaccessible to conventional approaches, this study establishes spatial arrangement of functionalized groups as a critical and tunable design axis, paving the way for the predictive engineering of silica-based materials with optimized interfacial performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Ghosh, Nicholas Sesing, Tina Salguero, Sergey Rumyantsev, Roger K. Lake, Alexander A. Balandin</p>
            <p>In quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) charge-density-wave (CDW) systems, electric current comprises normal electrons and a collective, electron-lattice condensate current associated with CDW sliding. While achieving the dissipation-less Frohlich current of the sliding condensate is impossible in real materials, one can imagine an important related target, namely reaching the electron transport regime where electronic noise is inhibited due to the collective, strongly-correlated nature of the electron-lattice condensate current. Here we report that in nanowires of the fully-gapped CDW material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. This discovery signals intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated transport regime. The dominant noise source due to fluctuations in the CDW depinning threshold is extrinsic and caused by lattice imperfections that locally pin the condensate. Once the bias voltage is well past threshold and the sliding mode is established, the normalized noise drops below the noise of normal electrons. No residual minimum noise level is observed for the current of the condensate. Since flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices, our discovery introduces a fundamentally new strategy for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics using strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the amplitude and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</p>

            <p>Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherent effects can be probed in multilayer graphene through electronic transport measurements at low temperatures. In particular, bilayer graphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the conductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and dependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a molecular thin film influence these scattering mechanisms, which can be quantified through the known theory of magnetoconductance for bilayer graphene. Here, we present weak localization measurements in a copper-phthalocyanine / bilayer graphene / h-BN heterostructure that suggest an important suppression of trigonal warping effects in bilayer graphene (BLG), restoring the manifestation of the chirality of the charge carriers in the localization properties of BLG. Additionally, we observe a charge transfer of 3.6$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ from the BLG to the molecules, as well as a very small degradation of the mobility of the BLG/h-BN heterostructure upon the deposition of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The molecular arrangement of the CuPc thin film is characterized in a control sample through transmission electron microscopy, that we relate to the electronic transport results.</p>

            <p>This study presents a novel approach for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in pig manure wastewater using magnet-ite-based magnetic nanofibers (MNFs) as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. The MNFs, composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) embedded with MnFe_2O_4 nanoparticles, were synthesized via electrospinning and exhibited high stability and catalytic efficiency. The degradation process was driven by hydroxyl radical (OH) formation through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation on the MNF surface. The results showed that TC was first adsorbed onto the MNFs before undergoing oxidation, with treatment efficiency increasing with H2O2 concentration up to an optimum point, due to increased OH scavenging by H_2O_2. A heterogeneous dynamic kinetic model (DKM) was developed to describe the degradation mechanism, incorporating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, catalyst surface inactivation, and polymer strip-ping effects. Furthermore, the application of an alternating magnetic field significantly accelerated the reaction rate, likely due to localized heating effects. This study highlights the potential of MNFs as a scalable, reusable and efficient alternative for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater treatment, offering advantages over conventional homogeneous Fenton processes by minimizing iron sludge formation and broadening the operational pH range.</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.</p>

            <p>Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</p>

            <h2>$N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Maeda, Tsubasa Oishi</p>
            <p>Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Scott, Bryce Gadway, V. W. Scarola</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal</p>
            <p>The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</p>

While broadly applicable to various quantum systems, including atoms and molecules, in this initial application we focus on the photoabsorption cross section of light nuclei, where benchmarks against numerically exact techniques are available. Our accurate theoretical predictions are complemented by robust uncertainty quantification, enabling meaningful comparisons with experiments. We demonstrate that a simple nuclear Hamiltonian, based on a leading-order pionless effective field theory expansion and known to accurately reproduce the ground-state energies of nuclei with $A\leq 20$ nucleons also provides a reliable description of the photoabsorption cross section.</p>

To better understand features, we adopt a geometric perspective, viewing them as a learned coordinate system for mapping an embedded data distribution. We motivate a model of a generic data distribution as a random lattice and analyze its properties using percolation theory. Learned features are categorized into context, component, and surface features. The model is qualitatively consistent with recent findings in mechanistic interpretability and suggests directions for future research.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.</p>

Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</p>

            <p>Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</p>

The resulting idea of quantum thermodynamic engines holds promise for harvesting novel sources of energy of purely quantum origin, like quantum statistics, to extract mechanical work from macroscopic quantum systems like Bose-Einstein condensates. It also allows one to explore thermodynamic thinking to `small' systems consisting only a few particles in quantum theory. In an earlier paper we had studied the quantum Otto engine using a small number of one-dimensional anyons as the medium to drive the thermodynamic engine. In this sequel, we study the gold-standard of thermodynamic engines, namely the Carnot engine, using two-dimensional anyons as the medium. An explicit expression is derived for the efficiency of the anyonic quantum Carnot engine.</p>

            <h2>Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaoru Mizuta, Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p>The nature of electronic excited states has a deep impact on the dynamics of molecular spins, but remains poorly understood and characterized. Here we carry out a thorough multiconfigurational investigation for two prototypical molecular qubits based on vanadyl and copper tetra-phenyl porphyrins. State-average CASSCF and NEVPT2 calculations have been employed with four different active spaces of growing complexity to account for the d-d, second d-shell, ligand-to-metal charge transfer states and $\pi-\pi^*$ excited states, revealing an in-depth picture of low-lying excited states in agreement with experimental observations. The largest active spaces attempted, (13,14) for the vanadyl and (17,12) for the copper compounds, reveal that the lowest-lying excited states originate from $\pi-\pi^*$ quartet excitations. These findings shed light on the nature of the excited states of molecular qubits, taking an important step toward elucidating their role in molecular spin dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Raisinger, Qiwei Zhang, John E. Bolander, Jan Eliáš</p>
            <p>The study investigates the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete, elastically homogeneous models of heterogeneous media. The homogeneity is accomplished either by volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of constitutive function or by an auxiliary stress homogenization method. The elastic parameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to introduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the discrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using statistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard constitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions as well as dependencies between stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of the different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The elastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower strain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material. Randomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of inelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the homogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the damage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of material structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.</p>

            <p>Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.</p>

Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</p>

This compound shows the metamagnetic transition which indicates the magnetic field induced charge order melting at the room temperature T = 293 K. We reveled that the temperature dependence of the critical field, where the highest critical field is higher than 100 T. At low temperatures, it has been found that the metamagnetic transitions become broad and vanish in the field ascending process below 70 K. On the other hand, in the field descending process, a clear metamagnetic transition is observed even below 70 K. This unusual behavior can be understood as the gradual charge order melting by magnetic field, and its simultaneous reformation. A coexistence of multiple order parameters can account for the observed characteristic dynamics of the first order phase transition. Finally, we constructed the B-T phase diagram with the unusual critical feature at ultrahigh magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>A quantum system constrained to a degenerate energy eigenspace can undergo a nontrival time evolution upon adiabatic driving, described by a non-Abelian Berry phase. This type of dynamics may provide logical gates in quantum computing that are robust against timing errors. A strong candidate to realize such holonomic quantum gates is an electron or hole spin qubit trapped in a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, whose twofold Kramers degeneracy is protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and quantitatively analyze protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a loop of quantum dots. One of these protocols allows to characterize the local internal Zeeman field directions in the dots of the loop. We expect a near-term realisation of these protocols, as all key elements have been already demonstrated in spin-qubit experiments. These experiments would be important to assess the potential of holonomic quantum gates for spin-based quantum information processing.</p>

It is shown that activation of a Josephson plasma resonance can greatly enhance the detector responsivity in proportion to the quality factor of the junction. The ways of tuning the detector for achieving optimal operation are discussed. For realistic parameters of Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions, the sensitivity can reach $S\simeq 5\times10^{12}$ (V/W).</p>

            <p>The present study focuses on the intrinsic properties of the SmFe10Co2-xVx (x = 0-2) alloys, which includes the SmFe10Co2 alloy, one of the most promising permanent magnets with the ThMn12 type of structure due to its large saturation magnetization (1.78 T), high Curie temperature (Tc = 859 K), and anisotropy field (12 T) experimentally obtained. Unfortunately, its low coercivity (<0.4 T) hinders its use in permanent magnet applications. The effect of V-doping on magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and Curie temperature is investigated by electronic band structure calculations. The spin-polarized fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) band structure method, which employs the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with substitutional disorder, has been used. The Hubbard-U correction to local spin density approximation (LSDA +U) was used to account for the large correlation effects due to the 4f electronic states of Sm. The computed magnetic moments and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies were compared with existing experimental data to validate the theoretical approach's reliability. The exchange-coupling parameters from the Heisenberg model were used for obtaining the mean-field estimated Curie temperature. The magnetic anisotropy energy was separated into contributions from transition metals and Sm, and its relationships with the local environment, interatomic distances, and valence electron delocalization were analyzed. The suitability of the hypothetical SmFe10CoV alloy for permanent magnet manufacture was assessed using the calculated anisotropy field, magnetic hardness, and intrinsic magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional arrays of ballistic Josephson junctions are important as model systems for synthetic quantum materials. Here, we investigate arrays of multiterminal junctions which exhibit a phase difference $\varphi_0$ at zero current. When applying an in-plane magnetic field we observe nonreciprocal vortex depinning currents. We explain this effect in terms of a ratchet-like pinning potential, which is induced by spontaneous supercurrent loops. Supercurrent loops arise in multiterminal $\varphi_0$-junction arrays as a consequence of next-nearest neighbor Josephson coupling. Tuning the density of vortices to commensurate values of the frustration parameter results in an enhancement of the ratchet effect. In addition, we find a surprising sign reversal of the ratchet effect near frustration 1/3.

            <p>GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric magnet with a square lattice of Gd atoms, hosts a short-period skyrmion square lattice (SkL) without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). RKKY-type exchange between the Gd moments results in an exchange frustration, which is the main source of non-collinearity in the spiral phases of the system. Previous studies focused on the in-plane $\vec{Q}$ vectors in understanding the magnetic phases of the system as they appear and have been observed on the 2D Gd layers. In this work, we calculate the Gd-Gd magnetic exchange interactions ($J_{ij}$) and perform atomic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, providing new insights about GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our calculated $J_{ij}$ shows that the strongest magnetic interaction occurs between Gd atoms along the [111] body-diagonal direction of the unit cell. This, along with the body-centered tetragonal structure of the Gd sublattice, points to the presence of a hitherto ignored modulation vector, $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along the [111] direction in the spiral phases of the system. ASD simulations confirm this interlayer modulation, demonstrating that GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s magnetic phases are more complex than suggested by 2D layer observations. The total magnetic order is determined by $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$ alongside intralayer $\vec{Q}_{[100]}$ and $\vec{Q}_{[010]}$, establishing GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ as a strong 3D magnet requiring comprehensive theoretical modeling. Considering these, our ASD simulations accurately reproduce experimental phase transitions and highlight the significant role of dipolar interactions (due to the large Gd moment) over a weak uniaxial anisotropy in determining the ground state. This work enhances the understanding of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s complex magnetism, suggesting similar interlayer effects may be important in other layered magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Induced quantum magnetism on a triangular lattice of non-Kramers ions in PrMgAl11O19</h2>

            <p>We report the magnetic properties of the quantum triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) PrMgAl11O19 through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Strong magnetic anisotropy indicates the realization of an Ising-like magnetism in PrMgAl11O19 single crystal while no long-range magnetic ordering is realized down to 0.4 K. The splitting of the low-lying quasi-doublet into two singlets suggested by experimental data, is consistent with an effective pseudospin-1/2 scenario. The observed gapless excitations in zero field are attributed to induced quantum magnetism, they would be induced by magnetic interactions of an energy scale comparable with the splitting between the two singlets. Based on these results, we modeled the magnetic ground state of PrMgAl11O19 by a quantum Ising magnet with an intrinsic transverse field rather than a quantum spin liquid (QSL). In addition, our data show a non-monotonous response of the low-temperature specific heat to the external fields revealing a complex interplay between intrinsic and external magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</p>

            <h2>Systematic analysis of critical exponents in continuous dynamical phase transitions of weak noise theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Schorlepp, Ohad Shpielberg</p>
            <p>Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</p>

            <p>Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K, uniquely exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ $\simeq$ $19$ K. The interplay leads to narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced peak in the creep activation energy, and magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal the presence of very closely-spaced ($w\ll \lambda$) vortex clusters. We attribute these observations to the formation of vortex polarons for which we present a theoretical description. In contrast, we link strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work suggests new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with important applications in high-current conductors.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Transfer Torque in Altermagnets with Magnetic Textures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Vakili, Edward Schwartz, Alexey A. Kovalev</p>
            <p>We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</p>

            <p>Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>``Pasta alla Cacio e pepe'' is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio e pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1\% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the ``Mozzarella Phase'' and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. \tcr{We further analyze the effect of a less traditional stabilizer, trisodium citrate, and observe a sharp transition from the Mozzarella Phase to a completely smooth and stable sauce, in contrast to starch-stabilized mixtures, where the transition is more gradual.} Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</p>

Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs.

            <p>We explore the self-sustained Josephson junction dynamics in dipolar supersolids, predicting the possibility of self-trapping alongside the experimentally observed Josephson oscillations [Biagioni, G. et al., Nature 629, 773 (2024)]. Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Hence, the associated Hamiltonian allows us to straightforwardly determine the self-trapping regime. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson junction dynamics across its full range, and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions. We further find that the off-axis droplets move in the radial direction during the evolution in accordance with the size of the central droplet. Such movements do not interfere with the model predictions.</p>

            <p>The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.</p>

            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <h2>When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdiel de Jesús Espinosa-Champo, Alejandro Kunold, Gerardo G. Naumis</p>
            <p>Topological phases emerge as the parameters of a quantum system vary with time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be eliminated, allowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a closed trajectory in parameter space. In solid-state physics, this approach is commonly applied by taking a reciprocal space wavevector as the parameter, which is assumed to be varied by electromagnetic this http URL Berry curvature is then obtained by computing the derivatives of Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However, in many systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never satisfied. This is particularly true in Dirac and Weyl materials, where the Berry curvature is often calculated without considering the breakdown of the adiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate how other time-dependent topological quantities, specifically the Aharonov-Anandan phase, can be used to extract information not only about topology but also about band transitions in 2D materials. In particular, a relationship between the current and the Aharonov-Anandan phase is proved, showing that photon-induced transitions produce current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, showing how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights into topology, interband transitions, and currents. This is achieved by using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.</p>

            <p>Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the gelation of adhesive spinners confined to quasi-2D monolayers at low Reynolds numbers. Unlike the coarsening dynamics of passive colloids, spinner gelation follows a different pathway, displaying structural chirality during the early stages of aggregation. However, this chirality dissipates upon dynamical arrest, resulting in a final gel structure that resembles a conventional colloidal gel. As a result, we find no sign of odd mechanical responses. Nonetheless, the elastic modulus and gelation time remain tunable through spinning activity, providing a new avenue for the bottom-up design of programmable soft materials.</p>

            <p>Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.</p>

            <p>The paper presents a constraint-based collision model for Cosserat rods, able to handle dynamic or static contact between a large number of highly flexible structures. The model provides the required collision impulses prior to updating the solution of the rods, with the impulses accounted for as external loads. The procedure avoids the need to modify the structure solver itself and circumvents any iteration between the collision model and the solver for the Cosserat rods, maintaining the efficiency of any chosen Cosserat solver. The collision model is adopted from Tschisgale et al. (Arch. Appl. Mech., 2019) and extended towards higher stability, which is found necessary in the case of very flexible rods. Furthermore, the model is supplemented with additional terms that arise when the colliding rods are immersed in a fluid. The latter is accounted for by an immersed-boundary method. A large number of tests are conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the final model.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karim Aljamal, Xiao Wang</p>
            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energies between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the fine-tuned heat of adsorption model and uptake model qualitatively predict adsorption properties for original unaltered MOFs, they fail to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects at open metal sites significantly impact adsorption behaviors. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</p>

            <p>The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of Hund$'s$ metal physics in single-layered 3d transition metal oxide, $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K Pandey</p>
            <p>With density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the influence of Hund's coupling on the nature of electronic correlations in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$. Our results suggest strong signatures of Hund's metal physics in this compound. The Co 3$d$ states show large orbital differentiation in the degree of correlations and mass enhancement. The imaginary-time correlation functions suggest the presence of spin-orbital separation and large local charge fluctuations in the system. Breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture is observed at the lowest calculated temperature for various strengths of Hund's coupling, suggesting the Fermi-liquid coherence scale lower than $\sim$100 K. Interestingly, a sudden emergence of a gapped state is noted for $e_g$ orbitals in its spectral density of states at $\sim$200 K in the vicinity of Fermi-level. Among the Co 3$d$ states 3$d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ foster enlarged correlations. This study conclusively identifies $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ as the first single-layered 3$d$ transition metal oxide to be classified as Hund's metal.</p>

            <h2>Immersed figure-8 annuli and anyons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Shi</p>
            <p>Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through the entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can be immersed in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In the appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</p>

            <h2>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Xin Hong Goh</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erdös--Rényi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</p>

            <h2>XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Josias Old, Alex Townsend-Teague, Manuel Rispler, Jens Eisert, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</p>

            <h2>The robustness condition for general disordered discrete time crystals, and subspace-thermal DTCs from phase transitions between different n-tuple DTCs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongye Yu, Tzu-Chieh Wei</p>
            <p>We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.</p>

            <p>Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</p>

            <p>Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</p>

            <p>Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</p>

            <h2>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</p>

            <p>We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by this http URL and this http URL long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</p>

            <p>Topological and crystalline orders of electrons both benefit from enhanced Coulomb interactions in partially filled Landau levels. In bilayer graphene (BLG), the competition between fractional quantum Hall liquids and electronic crystals can be tuned electrostatically. Applying a displacement field leads to Landau-level crossings, where the interaction potential is strongly modified due to changes in the orbital wave functions. Here, we leverage this control to investigate phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders at constant filling factors in the lowest Landau level of BLG. Using transport measurements in high-quality hBN-encapsulated devices, we study transitions as a function of displacement field near crossings of $N=0$ and $N=1$ orbitals. The enhanced Landau-level mixing near the crossing stabilizes electronic crystals at all fractional fillings, including a resistive state at $\nu = \frac{1}{3}$ and a reentrant integer quantum Hall state at $\nu = \frac{7}{3}$. On the $N=0$ side, the activation energies of the crystal and fractional quantum Hall liquid vanish smoothly and symmetrically at the transition, while the $N=1$ transitions out of the crystal appear discontinuous. Additionally, we observe quantized plateaus forming near the crystal transition at half filling of the $N=0$ levels, suggesting a paired composite fermion state stabilized by Landau level mixing.</p>

We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport.

            <p>Below a continuous symmetry breaking phase transition, the relevant collective excitations are due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the order parameter, which are referred to as Higgs and Goldstone modes, respectively. In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the equivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states accessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite difficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy Goldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this work, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material CuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved second harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light pulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric dipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in the amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and thus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to the Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the excitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon, distinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is due to the Goldstone mode.</p>

In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design.

We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</p>

            <p>Twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) has emerged as an ideal model system for investigating novel strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, the experimental construction of tFLG with high structural stability is still challenging. Here, we introduce a highly accessible method for fabricating robust tFLG by polymer micro-tip manipulated origami. Through using a self-prepared polymer micro-tip, which is composed of multiple dimethylpolysiloxane, poly(vinyl chloride), and graphite sheets, to fold graphene layers, we fabricated tFLG with different twist angles (0°-30°) and various layers, including twisted bilayers (1+1), twisted double-bilayers (2+2), twisted double-trilayers (3+3), and thicker layers. Even ABC-stacked tFLG were created, such as twisted ABC/ABC and ABC/ABA graphene coexisting in an ABC-ABA domain wall region. We found that the origami-fabricated tFLG exhibits high stability against thermal and mechanical perturbations including heating and transferring, which could be attributed to its special folding and tearing structures. Moreover, based on the rich types of samples, we revealed twist-angle and stacking-order dependent Raman characteristics of tFLG, which is valuable for understanding the stacking-modulated phonon spectroscopy. Our experiments provide a simple and efficient approach to construct structurally robust tFLG, paving the way for the study of highly stable twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Planar Nernst effect from hidden band geometry in layered two-dimensional materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Biswas, Harsh Varsney, Amit Agarwal</p>
            <p>The Nernst effect is a versatile phenomenon relevant for energy harvesting, magnetic sensing, probing band topology and charge-neutral excitations. The planar Nernst effect (PNE) generates an in-plane voltage transverse to an applied temperature gradient under an in-plane magnetic field. Conventional Berry curvature-induced PNE is absent in two-dimensional (2D) systems, as the out-of-plane Berry curvature does not couple to the in-plane electron velocity. We challenge this notion by demonstrating a distinct planar Nernst effect in quasi-2D materials (2DPNE). We show that the 2DPNE originates from previously overlooked planar components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, arising from inter-layer tunneling in multilayered 2D systems. We comprehensively analyze the band-geometric origin and crystalline symmetry constraints on 2DPNE responses. We illustrate its experimental feasibility in strained bilayer graphene. Our findings significantly expand the theoretical understanding of planar Nernst effects, providing a clear pathway for next-generation magnetic sensing and energy-harvesting applications.</p>

            <p>Static and dynamical magnetic and electronic properties of the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ have been investigated by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The temperature dependence of Knight shift ($K$) shows a similar temperature dependence of the DC magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ except for the low-temperature region below $\sim$ 50 K where $K$ is almost constant while $\chi$ keeps increasing, which suggests that the increase in $\chi$ at low temperatures is not intrinsic. $^{27}$Al spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature ($1/T_1T$) is found to be constant, confirming the metallic state of Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ from a microscopic point of view. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$ data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$. These fluctuations are suggested to be very slow with frequencies on the order of kilohertz or lower.</p>

            <p>Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of Xenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), phosphorene, and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), which are separated by insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The knowledge of the energy spectrum completely defines the dynamics of a quantum system for a given initial state. This makes spectroscopy a key characterization technique when studying or designing qubits and complex quantum systems. In semiconductor quantum dots, the electronic quantum states can be probed through charge transport spectroscopy, but the electric current itself disrupts the fragile quantum system, and the technique is practically limited to gate-defined quantum dots. Epitaxial quantum dots benefit from excellent optical properties, but are usually incompatible with charge transport, while alternative spectroscopy techniques provide only limited information. Here we demonstrate a spectroscopy technique which utilizes nuclear spins as a non-invasive probe. By using spin currents instead of the charge currents we achieve near-equilibrium probing. Experiments are conducted on low-strain GaAs/AlGaAs epitaxial dots, revealing energy spectra for charge configurations with up to seven electrons and the subtle properties of the multi-electron states. The rich variety of observations includes long-lived spin-qubit states in s and p shells, ground-state phase transitions, strong spin-orbit coupling regimes, and anomalously fast nuclear spin diffusion. Experiments are backed up by good agreement with the first-principles configuration-interaction numerical modelling. Our work uncovers few-electron states as a new operating regime for optically active quantum dots. Accurate control and probing of many-body states offers a test-bed system for fundamental physics studies, while prospective technological applications include electron spin qubits with extended coherence and scalable electrical control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Bao Zha, Peng Jiang, Yan-Ling Li, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</p>

            <h2>Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artur Soriani, Elsen Tjhung, Étienne Fodor, Tomer Markovich</p>
            <p>Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</p>

            <p>Ongoing research in the area of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to reduce reliance on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), providing more affordable and sustainable energy storage solutions. Polyanionic compounds have emerged as promising options due to their stable structure and ability to withstand high-voltage conditions as well as fast charging capabilities. This review offers a thorough discussion of phosphate-based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs, exploring their structure, electrochemical performance with various transition metals, and existing challenges. We discuss different polyanionic frameworks, such as ortho-phosphates, fluoro-phosphates, pyro-phosphates, mix pyro-phosphates, and NASICON-based phosphates, highlighting their unique structural characteristics and ability to perform well across a wide potential range. Further, we delve into the mechanisms governing sodium storage and tunability of redox potentials in polyanionic materials, providing insights into the factors that affect their electrochemical performance. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential avenues for the practical applications of polyanionic high-voltage cathodes in sodium-ion battery technologies.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-induced first-order superfluid transition in unitary $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgii Kalagov</p>
            <p>We investigate the superfluid phase transition in an $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric Fermi gas with $N$ distinct spin states using the functional renormalization group. To capture pairing phenomena beyond mean-field theory, we introduce an auxiliary bosonic field and employ the leading order of the derivative expansion of the partially bosonized effective average action. By discretizing the effective potential on a grid and numerically integrating the flow equations, we resolve the thermodynamic behavior near the transition. Our results reveal a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition for $N \geq 4$, which is absent at the mean-field level. In the unitary regime, we provide quantitative predictions for the critical temperature, as well as for the discontinuities in the superfluid gap and entropy density as functions of $N$. With increasing $N$, the critical temperature decreases, while the discontinuities become more pronounced, indicating a stronger first-order transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avigail Gil, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We study a single component (i.e., single valley, spin-polarized) two-dimensional electron gas with $C_{3v}$ symmetry tuned to a Van-Hove (VH) singularity. Generically, there may be either three or six VH points at the Fermi level, related to each other by symmetry. Using a renormalization group analysis, we show that when the effective interactions between electrons at the VH points are positive, the system is stable. In contrast, if the effective interactions are negative, the system develops an instability toward either pair density wave (PDW) or charge density wave (CDW) orders, depending on the anisotropy of the dispersion at the VH points. The PDW may have either a single wavevector or multiple wavevectors. The PDW phase with three coexisting wavevectors can support fractional $\tfrac{h}{6e}$ vortices. The interplay between the geometry of the Fermi surface and the singularity of the density of states is the key that enables PDW formation.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.</p>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity is a quintessential unconventional quantum state. In Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests itself in the supercurrent interference pattern as the invariance of the critical current under the reversal of both transport and magnetic field directions, i.e., $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$. So far, such systems have been realized in devices where superconductivity is injected into a deliberately constructed weak link medium, usually carefully tuned by external magnetic fields and electrostatic gating. In this work, we report time-reversal symmetry breaking in spontaneously emerging Josephson junctions without intentionally constructed weak links. This is realized in ultra-pure single-crystal microstructures of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, an unconventional superconductor with a multi-component order parameter. Here, the Josephson effect emerges intrinsically at the superconducting domain wall, where the degenerate states partially overlap. In addition to violating $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$, we find a rich variety of exotic transport phenomena, including a supercurrent diode effect present in the entire interference pattern, two-channel critical current oscillations with a period that deviates from $\Phi_0$, fractional Shapiro steps, and current-switchable bistable states with highly asymmetric critical currents. Our findings provide direct evidence of TRSB in unstrained Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and reveal the potential of domain wall Josephson junctions, which can emerge in any superconductor where the pairing symmetry is described by a multi-component order parameter.</p>

Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/Å and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</p>

We study the periodically driven quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of Ising spin-glass in which all spins are coupled to each other with random couplings. We explore the possibility of DTC phase within three different driving protocols. For all the cases, quantum SK model shows a robust DTC phase with no initial state dependence at all. We compare the periodically driven SK model with other models of long-range interactions with uniform coefficients where randomness is induced through a local field. In complete contrast to the SK model, these models show strong initial state dependence with a large number of initial states showing decay in periodic oscillations in spin-spin correlation function with time.</p>

            <p>Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</p>

            <p>Auger processes play a critical role in the behavior of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). While nonradiative Auger recombination is a key performance-limiting factor in light-emitting applications, Auger effects also present exciting opportunities for hot-carrier manipulation in emerging optoelectronic and photochemical technologies. Recent studies have shown that incorporating magnetic manganese (Mn) dopants into QDs enables an ultrafast spin-exchange (SE) mechanism that significantly accelerates Auger recombination and related processes. However, the fundamental dynamics of SE-Auger recombination, including its dependence on QD size, exciton multiplicity, and Mn-ion content, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SE-Auger recombination in Mn-doped QDs across three regimes defined by the energetic alignment between the QD band-edge exciton and the internal Mn spin-flip transition: resonant, downhill, and uphill, corresponding to the exciton energy being approximately equal to, greater than, or smaller than the Mn spin-flip transition energy, respectively. We find that SE-Auger recombination dominates multiexciton dynamics in both resonant and downhill regimes, proceeding on ultrafast, sub-picosecond timescales, that is, significantly faster than conventional Auger decay. Notably, SE-Auger lifetimes are primarily governed by the occupancy of intrinsic excitonic states, with minimal dependence on QD size or the number of excited Mn ions. In the uphill regime, SE-Auger recombination coexists with conventional Auger processes, enabling direct comparison of their timescales alongside co-occurring hot-carrier cooling. These findings establish that SE-Auger recombination outpaces phonon-assisted cooling, making it uniquely suited for the generation and manipulation of hot carriers, and opening new avenues in advanced photoconversion and photochemistry.</p>

            <p>The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <p>Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) material, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing with forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5 formed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic film and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically studied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical resistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing surface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase transition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully oxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from thermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase transition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4°C in both infrared transmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of best quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The thermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication of high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for high-performance thermal control applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of cavities in BCC-Fe with coexisting H and He under fusion environments</h2>

            <p>In the fusion environment, understanding the synergistic effects of transmutation-produced hydrogen (H), helium (He), and irradiation-induced displacement damage in iron-based alloys is crucial for the development of structural materials for fusion reactors. When H and He atoms are simultaneously introduced into the matrix, the interaction between irradiation-induced cavity defects (voids and bubbles) with H and He, along with their evolutionary behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, the evolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H and He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient and suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing interatomic interactions is established. Based on the newly developed MD model, the evolutionary behavior of H/He atoms and cavities is systematically investigated under various temperature and cavity structure conditions. Specifically, the kinetic process of H/He capture by cavities is elucidated for different scenarios. Additionally, thermodynamic analyses are employed to assess the feasibility of cavity trapping of H under varying conditions. The results exhibit strong consistency with experimental results and provide significant evidence supporting the formation of the core-shell structure (where He is confined at the cavity center while H accumulates at the surface) from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. This work provides mechanistic insights into the nucleation and growth of cavities over extended temporal and spatial scales in the presence of H-He synergies.</p>

            <h2>Thermodiffusion mechanism for the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metal melt</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. I. Karasevskii, A. Yu. Naumuk</p>
            <p>A theoretical model of the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metallic melt is proposed. It has been shown that the appearance of a significant temperature gradient during the quenching of a metallic melt leads to thermodiffusion of defects and their outflow from the melt volume, which manifests itself in a significant reduction in the number of free spaces for the diffusion transfer of the atoms of the melt. Due to the thermodiffusion process, a significant restructuring of the microstructure of the medium occurs, which leads to a significant increase in viscosity, a decrease in the diffusion coefficient and specific volume of the substance, and changes in the mechanisms of deformation. The corresponding calculations of temperature distribution, thermodiffusion and distribution of the components of the melt have been carried out.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of quantum criticality in underdoped cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changshuai Lan, Chengyu Yan, Yihang Li, Qiao Chen, Huai Guan, Xinming Zhao, Dong Wu, Butian Zhang, Youwei Zhang, Shun Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum criticality, with both static and dynamic information of the system intrinsically encoded in characteristic length scales, serves as one of the most sensitive and universal probes to monitor quantum phase transition. Qualitatively different quantum criticality behaviours have been widely observed even in the same condensed matter system. The discrepancy is attributed to sample specificity but has not been systemically addressed. Here we report a single-parameter driven three-stage evolution of quantum criticality unveiled in superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} flakes. The evolution starts with a single quantum critical point emerging at the boundary between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases, then evolving into anomalous quantum Griffiths singularity at the medium doping levels and eventually being replaced by quantum Griffiths singularity in the deep superconducting regime. A puddle model that incorporates the developments of antiferromagnetic correlation can capture the evolution. The results offer a new aspect to examine previous seemingly sample-specific quantum critical behavior and lay the foundation for further exploring complex quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems; meanwhile they shed light on the detailed interaction between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in cuprates.</p>

            <h2>How rigidity percolation and bending stiffness shape colloidal gel elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Richard, Mehdi Bouzid</p>
            <p>Dispersed colloidal particles within a suspension can aggregate and spontaneously self-organize into a robust, percolating structure known as a gel. These network-like structures are prevalent in nature and play a critical role in many industrial processes, including those involving batteries, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations. In this paper, we examine the emergence of elasticity in colloidal gels. We show that gelation is governed by a rigidity percolation transition. We identify a characteristic correlation length that quantifies the extent of elastic and structural inhomogeneities, which diverges at the critical point. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the interaction types, the particle concentration, or the specific route to non-ergodicity i.e. the preparation protocol, the elastic moduli and vibrational properties of gels can be accurately predicted within a unifying framework, in which the bending modes of fractal clusters -- approximately the size of this correlation length -- dominate under small deformations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the coherence and correlations of many-body states appearing in topological pumping in a one-dimensional Bose gas. By analyzing the system at zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum distributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order correlation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the momentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of non-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel oscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the density-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work illustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between bosonic and fermionic correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ShuaiYu Wang, Wei-Wei Wang, Jiaxuan Fan, Xiaodong Zhou, Xiao-Ping Li, Lei Wang</p>
            <p>Ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAMs) offer unique magnetoelectric coupling properties by combining the characteristics of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, yet their multifunctional electric control remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce and investigate a scenario for the simultaneous electrical switching of electronic spin and magnonic chirality splitting in two-dimensional FEAMs. Based on the C2DB database, employing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we study prototypical candidates CrPS$_3$ and V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl. We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises from asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the $xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric polarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining [C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing the ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic spin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes. This shows these materials as dual-switchable FEAMs, enabling unified electrical manipulation of electron and magnon properties. A potentially experimentally detectable method via the magneto-optical Kerr effect was derived. This work provides a materials-specific realization and theoretical basis for designing novel electrically controlled multifunctional spintronic, spin caloritronic, and magnonic devices.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Spin-Orbit-Coupled Hamiltonian Model for Accelerated Quantum Material Discovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhong, Rui Wang, Xingao Gong, Hongjun Xiang</p>
            <p>The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex systems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing machine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by introducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that is applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian into spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2) symmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this decomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two components, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude discrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves remarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related component) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput screening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise predictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for system-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for rapid discovery of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered lithium-rich antiperovskites (Li$_2$Fe)SeO and (Li$_2$Fe)SO host lithium and iron ions on the same atomic position which octahedrally coordinates to central oxygens. In a cubic antiperovskite these sites form Kagome planes stacked along the <111> directions which triangular motifs induce high geometric frustration in the diluted magnetic sublattice for antiferromagnetic interactions. Despite their compelling properties as high-capacity Li-ion battery cathode materials, very little is known about the electronic and magnetic properties of lithium-rich antiperovskites. We report static magnetization, Mössbauer, and NMR studies on both compounds. Our data reveal a Pauli paramagnetic-like behaviour, a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered ground state below 50 K and a regime of short-range magnetic correlations up to 100 K. Our results are consistent with a random Li-Fe distribution on the shared lattice position. In addition, Li-hopping is observed above 200 K with an activation energy of E$_a$ = 0.47 eV. Overall, our data elucidate static magnetism in a disordered magnetically frustrated and presumably semimetallic system with thermally induced ion diffusion dynamics.</p>

            <p>The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic systems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.</p>

            <p>Premelting at the ice-polymer interfaces, in which a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) forms below the melting point, is strongly influenced by polymer surface chemistry; however, the molecular-scale mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how polymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our simulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have distinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and diffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker QLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a hydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial water structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding of polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for designing anti-icing and low-friction materials.</p>

            <p>We show that ultrafast electronic $4f$ multiplet transitions in terbium metal are manifested by changes in the relative spectral weight of the $M_5$ and $M_4$ X-ray absorption resonances. Our experimental results are supported by a simulation of excited multiplet spectra with atomistic calculations; they prove that the so-called third rule of Thole and van der Laan, which relates the branching ratio of the spin-orbit split resonances to the total angular momentum $J$ of the excited ion, is also valid in non-equilibrium. The presented detection scheme allows to detect $J$-changing excitation, \textit{i.e}, alterations of spin and orbital states, even in samples without net magnetization. This makes branching-ratio spectroscopy a powerful tool for the quantitative investigation of ultrafast changes in angular momentum $J$.</p>

            <p>Binary mixtures of the ferronematic compound DIO with recently reported non-ferroelectric material WJ-16 which shows Colossal Permittivity (CP) ~5000 and superparaelectricity (SPE) were studied by POM, electrical switching studies, and dielectric spectroscopy. Three mixtures with different contents of WJ-16 as 10, 25 and 50% in DIO as host were prepared. Our original expectation was the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic (NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures exhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as superparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two distinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP mode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is redefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration of materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid crystalline materials. The hyper dielectric phase has a good potential as a working media for supercapacitors industry.</p>

            <h2>Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phanindra Dewan, Soumyadeep Mondal, Sumantra Sarkar</p>
            <p>Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect proposed in recent studies offers a new way to probe intrinsic band geometric properties in a large class of materials. However, the search of material platforms with a large response remains a problem. Here, we suggest that topological Weyl semimetals can host enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect. From a model study, we show that the enhancement is mainly from the orbital contribution, and the response coefficient exhibits a characteristic resonance-like lineshape around the Weyl-point energy. Using first-principles calculations, we confirm these features for the concrete material CuTlSe$_{2}$. Previous studies have reported two different topological states of CuTlSe$_{2}$. We find this difference originates from two slightly different structures with different lattice parameters. We show that the nonlinear planar Hall response is much stronger in the Weyl semimetal state than in the topological insulator state, and the large response is indeed dominated by orbital contribution amplified by Weyl points. Our work reveals a close connection between nonlinear orbital responses and topological band features, and suggests CuTlSe$_{2}$ as a suitable platform for realizing enhanced nonlinear planar Hall effect.</p>

While the indirect techniques to probe the bulk superconducting properties of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ indicate a conventional isotropic order parameter, we show that the direct spectroscopic determination of the superconducting energy gap reveals an anomalous suppression of Andreev reflection between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and a normal metal. This observation hints to the presence of incomplete superconducting gap formation, at least along certain momentum directions, and consequent low-lying quasiparticle states. An analysis of multiple Andreev reflection spectra captured at different points on the surface of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ reveals a distribution of the superconducting energy gap which is consistent with an anisotropic superconducting order parameter.</p>

We evaluate the expected sensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line dimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized finite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a straightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given transport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance to electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several aluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect dimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between mechanical forces and the internal-state dynamics of a chain of Rydberg atoms trapped in tweezer arrays under the facilitation constraint. Dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms couple electronic (spin) degrees of freedom with excited motional (phonon) states. We show that this interaction leads to highly correlated and non-classical phonon states in the form of squeezed center of mass position states of the Rydberg atoms. Coupling with either a normal or an inverted Lennard-Jones-type potential, resulting from an avoided crossing of Rydberg potential curves, leads to in-phase or out-of-phase correlated oscillations in the atom positions respectively. Furthermore, the growth dynamics of a finite cluster of excited Rydberg atoms can be mapped to the dynamics of a single particle in a semi-infinite lattice subject to a linear potential gradient caused by spin-phonon interactions. This results in Bloch oscillations in the spin cluster size, which in turn localize spin excitations in the system.</p>

Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Based on the momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation, we provide self-consistent numerical calculations of the dynamics of conduction electrons in thin noble metal films after linear and non-linear optical excitations with infrared and terahertz frequencies. Focusing exclusively on electron-phonon interaction, orientational relaxation is introduced and acts as dephasing of the optical excitation on a scale of tens of fs. In the linear regime, our numerical results agree with the experimental fits to a Drude model and predicts for non-linear excitations a field strength dependency of the orientational relaxation rate. In the THz regime, where the orientational relaxation proceeds faster than the oscillation cycle of the excitation THz field, a new high order dissipative Kerr-type non-linearity is predicted. This non-linearity originates from the Pauli blocking included in the electron-phonon scattering and results in a non-linearly increasing transmission of the film, detectable in experiments.</p>

Our numerical results for gold reveal that orientational relaxation exists independently of the absorbed optical energy and dominates on time scales on the first tens of fs after excitation. Incorporating also thermalization and cooling on times up to a few ps, our approach provides a simultaneous description of optical and thermal properties of noble metals under initial non-equilibrium conditions.</p>

The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species.

            <h2>$η$-pairing states in the Hubbard model with non-uniform Hubbard interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. K. He, Z. Song</p>
            <p>The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Interpretable machine learning-guided design of Fe-based soft magnetic alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditi Nachnani, Kai K. Li-Caldwell, Saptarshi Biswas, Prince Sharma, Gaoyuan Ouyang, Prashant Singh</p>
            <p>We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys, particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1.

            <h2>TDP-43 multidomains and RNA modulate interactions and viscoelasticity in biomolecular condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yui Matsushita, Ikki Yasuda, Fuga Watanabe, Eiji Yamamoto</p>
            <p>RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.</p>

            <h2>Stainless steel in an electronically excited state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita Medvedev</p>
            <p>Austenitic stainless steel (Fe$_{0.5875}$Cr$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.09}$Ni$_{0.07}$C$_{0.0025}$) is modeled with the XTANT-3 simulation toolkit to evaluate its properties in an electronically excited state produced by ultrafast laser irradiation. The model relies on density-functional tight binding to obtain the electronic Hamiltonian, producing the electronic energy levels and wave functions. They are used to calculate the electron heat capacity, electron heat conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter at the electronic temperatures up to 25,000 K. It is revealed that stainless steel nonthermally melts at sub-picosecond timescales at the deposited dose of ~1.4 eV/atom (the electronic temperature $T_e \sim 10,000$ K): the atomic lattice disorders due to modifications of the interatomic potential induced by the excitation of electrons, even without electron-phonon coupling (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Including the electron-phonon coupling (non-Born-Oppenheimer simulation) lowers the damage threshold dose to ~0.45 eV/atom, triggering atomic disorder at picosecond timescales via thermal melting, predicated on the atomic heating by electrons.</p>

            <p>We investigate the local crystal-field environment of cerium in the clathrate compound CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$ (Ce-BAS) using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Ce-BAS is a rare example of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy rattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a temperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static crystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing between the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large internal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are well described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an energy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field states. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework points to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute this to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated with the Ce rattling motion. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical predictions of phonon-enhanced Kondo effects and dynamical Jahn-Teller distortions. Our results highlight the need for multi-orbital impurity models that include phonon coupling to fully describe the low-energy physics of Ce-BAS.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Relaxation Dynamics in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4: Evidence of Inertial Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Saha, M. Singh, P. D. Babu, S. Patnaik</p>
            <p>Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.</p>

            <h2>Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Kabiraj (Department of Physics, University of Calcutta), Raka Dasgupta (Department of Physics, University of Calcutta)</p>
            <p>We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p>

            <p>We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for realizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana zero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral Majorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable Majorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and Néel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We report on a tunable Josephson junction formed by a bilayer graphene ribbon encapsulated in WSe$_2$ with superconducting niobium contacts. We characterize the junction by measurements of the magnetic field induced interference pattern, and the AC Josephson effect manifested as "Shapiro steps", examining current dependent hysteresis and junction dynamics. The latter can be tuned by temperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field. Finally, we examine the evolution of the supercurrent when subjected to in-plane magnetic fields. Notably, we observe a strong anisotropy in the supercurrent with respect to the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. When the field is parallel to the current direction, the supercurrent is suppressed, and shows revivals with increasing magnetic field, whereas it remains almost unaffected when the field is oriented in a perpendicular direction. We suggest that this anisotropy is caused by the dependence of supercurrent interference on the junction geometry.</p>

            <p>We study spin transport of the XXZ model with next-nearest neighbor $\Delta_2$ terms. We compute numerically dependence of spin conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ on the anisotropy $\Delta$ and the ratio $r= \Delta_2/\Delta$, in the large $\Delta$ regime. We find that, when $0<r<1$, the low-frequency conductivity assumes an anomalous form $\sigma(\omega)\approx a \omega^2 + b \Delta^{-2} $. In particular, when $\Delta\to\infty$ the model becomes dynamically constrained and most states are localized. We show, microscopically, existence of magnon bound states in the strong coupling regime, which behave as self-generated disorders for single magnons. Based on this quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytical scalings, which match well with the numerical results.</p>

            <p>Ultrasound-guided drug and gene delivery (usdg) enables controlled and spatially precise delivery of drugs and macromolecules, encapsulated in microbubbles (embs) and submicron gas vesicles (gvs), to target areas such as cancer tumors. It is a non-invasive, high precision, low toxicity process with drastically reduced drug dosage. Rheological and acoustic properties of gvs and embs critically affect the outcome of usdg and imaging. Detailed understanding and modeling of their physical properties is thus essential for ultrasound-mediated therapeutic applications. State-of-the-art continuuum models of shelled bodies cannot incorporate critical details such as varying thickness of the encapsulating shell or specific interactions between its constituents and interior or exterior solvents. Such modeling approaches also do not allow for detailed modeling of chemical surface functionalizations, which are crucial for tuning the gv-blood interactions. We develop a general particle-based modeling framework for encapsulated bodies that accurately captures elastic and rheological properties of gvs and embs. We use dissipative particle dynamics to model the solvent, the gaseous phase in the capsid, and the triangulated surfaces of immersed objects. Their elastic behavior is studied and validated through stretching and buckling simulations, eigenmode analysis, shear flow simulations, and comparison of predicted gv buckling pressure with experimental data from the literature. The presented modeling approach paves the way for large-scale simulations of encapsulated bodies, capturing their dynamics, interactions, and collective behavior.</p>

            <p>BaBiO3 has lately gained high research attention as a parent material for an interesting family of alloyed compositions with multiple technological applications. In order to grow a variety of structures, a versatile deposition tool such as molecular beam epitaxy has to be employed. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of BaBiO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates is studied. When grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(001) or MgO(001) substrates, BaBiO3 is known to have two competing orientations namely, (001) and (011). Characterization of the thin film is carried out by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Pathways to block the growth of BaBiO3(011) and only grow the technologically relevant BaBiO3(001) are described for both substrates. Understanding of the enabler mechanism of the co-growth is established from epitaxy point of view. This can be beneficially utilized for growth of the different compositions of BaBiO3 material family in a more controlled manner.</p>

            <p>Fiber-reinforcement is a universal feature of many biological tissues. It involves the interplay between fiber stiffness, fiber orientation, and the elastic properties of the matrix, influencing pattern formation and evolution in layered tissues. Here, we investigate the deformation of a compressed film bonded to a half-space, where either the film or the substrate exhibits anisotropy. Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear incremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These analyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for surface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show that the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio between the substrate and the film moduli. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fiber-reinforcement in shaping pattern formation in anisotropic tissues and provide insights into the morphological evolution of biological tissues.</p>

Furthermore, we find an enhanced fraction of monolayers in the doped system.

The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</p>

            <p>Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450°C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400°C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richang Huang, Yongliang Hu, Xianzhang Chen, Peng Yu, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZM), distinguished by their non-locality and non-Abelian statistics, are central to the pursuit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) have emerged as a promising platform, offering robust and tunable MZM. However, the perceived sensitivity of topological superconductivity to the magnetic field orientation has posed a major obstacle, particularly for scalable network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ fundamentally persists under nearly arbitrary in-plane magnetic field directions. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of superconductivity itself, but from emergent shifted bulk states from other momentum points, which obscure the gap and MZM. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover visible MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJs render topological superconductivity robust against maligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival across complex junction networks and facilitating their braiding. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with phase or gate control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>A thermodynamic road to gravity and quantum phenomena: non-relativistic self-gravitating weakly nonlocal fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mátyás Szücs, Péter Ván</p>
            <p>A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field - a so-called internal variable - also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and the energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. The classical holography of perfect (i.e., non-dissipative) fluids is generally proved, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. Both Newtonian gravity and quantum fluid mechanics are covered as special cases of our fluid model. The unified framework generalises and couples quantum physics and gravitational phenomena, shedding light on the common background of several known modifications and generalisations together with thermodynamic restrictions.</p>

            <p>GaN defect-based quantum emitters are promising candidates for quantum information technologies, although their underlying nature remains elusive. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms responsible for this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.</p>

            <h2>True Solid-State Electrical Conduction of Proteins shows them to be Efficient Transport Media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Bera, Ayelet Vilan, Sourav Das, Israel Pecht, David Ehre, Mordechai Sheves, David Cahen</p>
            <p>While solid-state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over lengths that surpass those of conventional organic semiconducting systems, interfacial or contact effects may obscure the intrinsic protein charge transport properties. Therefore, contact resistance (RC) effects need to be quantified and then minimized, which poses a problem if 4-probe geometries cannot be used. Here we show how RC can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero-length resistance (RZLR) and short-circuit resistance (RS). We used AC (impedance spectroscopy) and DC measurements to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si-Au, Au-EGaIn, and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au-Pd, were compared. While Si-Au and Au-EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC that we ascribe to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein-electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (beta) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC, exceptionally low beta values (0.7 to 1.1 per nm) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.</p>

            <p>To overcome antimalarial drug resistance, carbohydrate derivatives as selective PfHT1 inhibitor have been suggested in recent experimental work with orthosteric and allosteric dual binding pockets. Inspired by this promising therapeutic strategy, herein, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the molecular determinants of co-administration on orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors targeting PfHT1. Our binding free energy analysis capture the essential trend of inhibitor binding affinity to protein from published experimental IC50 data in three sets of distinct characteristics. In particular, we rank the contribution of key residues as binding sites which categorized into three groups based on linker length, size of tail group, and sugar moiety of inhibitors. The pivotal roles of these key residues are further validated by mutant analysis where mutated to nonpolar alanine leading to reduced affinities to different degrees. The exception was fructose derivative, which exhibited a significant enhanced affinity to mutation on orthosteric sites due to strong changed binding poses. This study may provide useful information for optimized design of precision medicine to circumvent drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites with high efficacy.</p>

We characterize the ground-state correlations using exact diagonalization and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Although the bipartite entanglement is restricted to nearest neighbors, we reveal the presence of long-range genuine multipartite entanglement between spatially separated spin pairs. These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Nonthermal fixed points are paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium phenomena of relevance to high-energy physics, cosmology, and cold atomic gases. We propose that, despite their intrinsically nonequilibrium nature, nonthermal fixed points give rise to hydrodynamic excitations otherwise known in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium. As a result, nonthermal fixed points can also be characterized by transport coefficients, such as a far-from-equilibrium, and therefore manifestly time-dependent, incarnation of shear viscosity. We corroborate our proposal with explicit studies using relativistic kinetic theory with binary collisions of massless particles in the 14-moment approximation and comparisons to QCD kinetic theory simulations.</p>

            <p>The mining of synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a significant focus in materials science. However, identifying the precise synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF synthesis of all researchers.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn</p>
            <p>The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</p>

            <p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.</p>

            <h2>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Tang, Yimu Bao</p>
            <p>Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</p>

            <p>By means of Trotter's formula, we show that transition amplitudes between coherent states in the Rabi model can be understood in terms of a certain Ising model featuring long-range interactions (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in its thermodynamic limit. Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</p>

            <p>As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of traditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power dissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based on stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first proposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the power dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage amplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon, i.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of voltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to quantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power dissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new multistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs. To optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the voltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for multistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and 94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the proposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.</p>

            <p>We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.~Atiyah and R.~Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s.</p>

            <p>Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.</p>

            <p>The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. Our model has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, our analysis reveals continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs, challenging the idea that higher-order interactions lead to discontinuous transitions. Finally, we validate our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, providing additional evidence that real-world rumor propagation tends to occur near criticality. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems.</p>

            <p>Parity-time symmetry constrains the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems to be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.</p>

            <p>We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Jahanshahi, Damiano Pasini, Arash Yavari</p>
            <p>In recent years, a new class of mixed finite elements -- compatible-strain mixed finite elements (CSMFEs) -- has emerged that uses the differential complex of nonlinear elasticity. Their excellent performance in benchmark problems, such as numerical stability for modeling large deformations in near-incompressible solids, makes them a promising choice for solving engineering problems. Explicit forms exist for various shape functions of first-order CSMFEs. In contrast, existing second-order CSMFEs evaluate shape functions using numerical integration. In this paper, we formulate second-order CSMFEs with explicit shape functions for the displacement gradient and stress tensor. Concepts of vector calculus that stem from exterior calculus are presented and used to provide efficient forms for shape functions in the natural coordinate system. Covariant and contravariant Piola transformations are then applied to transform the shape functions to the physical space. Mid-nodes and pseudo-nodes are used to enforce the continuity constraints for the displacement gradient and stress tensor over the boundaries of elements. The formulation of the proposed second-order CSMFEs and technical aspects regarding their implementation are discussed in detail. Several benchmark problems are solved to compare the performance of CSMFEs with first-order CSMFEs and other second-order elements that rely on numerical integration. It is shown that the proposed CSMFEs are numerically stable for modeling near-incompressible solids in the finite strain regime.</p>

            <p>Large atomic models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to April 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research.

            <p>Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a plain gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</p>

            <p>We elucidate the dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ coupled to a real scalar via Yukawa interactions. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ with $e\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics of the theory. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cătălin Paşcu Moca, Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Angelo Valli, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd</p>
            <p>We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta < 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta > 1$) regimes. For $\Delta < 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta > 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.</p>

            <h2>Grain boundary complexion transitions in olivine with temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra C. Austin, Sanae Koizumi, Martin Folwarczny, David P. Dobson, Katharina Marquardt</p>
            <p>Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</p>

            <p>The minimal training set to train a working CNN is explored in detail. The considered model is the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest neighboring couplings, respectively. We train the CNN using the configurations of $g \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} J_2/|J_1| = 0.7$ and employ the resulting CNN to study the phase transition of $g = 0.8$. We find that this transfer learning is successful. In particular, only configurations of two temperatures, one is below and one is above the critical temperature $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, are needed to reach accurately determination of the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$. However, it may be subtle to use this strategy for the training. Specifically, for the considered model, due to the inefficiency of the single spin flip algorithm used in sampling the configurations at the low-temperature region, the two temperatures associated with the training set should not be too far away from the $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, otherwise, the performance of the obtained CNN is not of high quality, hence cannot determine the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$ accurately. For the considered model, we also uncover the condition for training a successful CNN when only configurations of two temperatures are considered as the training set.</p>

            <p>Thin-wall metal ultramicro- and nanoelectrodes (UMEs/NEs), especially gold NEs, are indispensable for high-resolution electrochemical microscopy, biosensing, and fundamental research. However, their damage susceptibility and the lack of scalable fabrication methods hinder broader adoption. We present a versatile wet-chemical approach for high-throughput fabrication of thin-wall Au NEs/UMEs and multifunctional NEs with ~80% reproducibility. This method is based on a unique template-assisted 1D growth of single-crystalline Au in borosilicate nanopipettes followed by electrochemical contacting with tungsten microwires, and focused ion beam milling, ensuring precise control over NEs dimensions. Adaptable to various metals and integrable in multifunctional probes, the method facilitates batch production of high-quality NEs with standardized electrical connections. Structural and electrochemical characterization reveals a twinned single-crystalline Au core, a seamless Au/glass interface, and highly stable electrochemical performance. Notably, smaller electrodes exhibit higher current densities, enhancing chemical detection sensitivity. Specifically, we demonstrate outstanding spatial (< 200 nm) and current (< 1 pA) resolutions, low limit of detection (~11.0 {\mu}M) and high stability (7 h) in scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM), by detecting photo-oxidation reaction on atomically smooth Au micro-flakes. We also demonstrate growth in double-barrel pipettes for SECM/SICM probes as well as Pt NEs. Overall, this scalable method addresses longstanding challenges in NEs, paving the way for advanced electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical microscopy, including SERS/TERS integration. With single-crystalline surfaces, these electrodes open new frontiers in catalysis, interfacial electrochemistry, biosensing, and molecular-scale investigations.</p>

            <p>We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling wetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we harness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and flow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the evolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any pre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and lattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special treatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple to implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse solid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle on a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical pressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise against gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion on a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to computationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid surfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.</p>

            <h2>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam L.H. Lau, Piers Coleman</p>
            <p>Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moiré AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moiré K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David T. S. Perkins, Aires Ferreira</p>
            <p>Spintronics has become a broad and important research field that intersects with magnetism, nano-electronics, and materials science. Its overarching aim is to provide a fundamental understanding of spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems that can enable a new generation of spin-based logic devices. Over the past decade, graphene and related 2D van der Waals crystals have taken center stage in expanding the scope and potential of spintronic materials. Their distinctive electronic properties and atomically thin nature have opened new opportunities to probe and manipulate internal electronic degrees of freedom. Purely electrical control over conduction-electron spins can be attained in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, due to proximity effects combined with graphene's high electronic mobility. Specifically, graphene experiences a proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient spin-charge interconversion processes; the two most well-known and at the forefront of current research are the spin Hall and inverse spin galvanic effects, wherein an electrical current yields a spin current and non-equilibrium spin polarization, respectively. This article provides an overview of the basic principles, theory, and experimental methods underpinning the nascent field of 2D material-based spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Andberger, Lorenzo Graziotto, Luca Sacchi, Mattias Beck, Giacomo Scalari, Jérôme Faist</p>
            <p>We demonstrate terahertz chiral sub-wavelength cavities that break time-reversal symmetry by coupling the degenerate linearly polarized modes of two orthogonal sets of nano-antenna arrays using the inter-Landau level transition of a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, realizing normalized light-matter coupling rates up to $\Omega_R/\omega_{\mathrm{cav}} = 0.78$ with a dispersion that is modified by the parasitic capacitive coupling between the orthogonal antennas. The deep sub-wavelength confinement of the nano-antennas means that the ultra-strong coupling regime can be reached even with a small number of carriers compared to Fabry-Perot cavities, making it viable to be used with a variety of 2D materials. The non-degenerate circularly polarized ground state was only obtained after carefully optimizing the optical design to minimize the parasitic coupling to linearly polarized light.</p>

            <p>AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanul Gupta, Guido Masella, Francesco Mattiotti, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Guido Pupillo</p>
            <p>The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</p>

            <h2>Level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biquan Yang, Zijian Xiong</p>
            <p>The full spectrum and integrability of unitary equivalent models are the same. A standard diagnostic tool of integrability is level spacing statistics which requires separating the full spectrum into sectors according to the symmetry. When two unitary equivalent models have different symmetries, it is interesting to know how their level spacing statistics show consistent conclusions. In this work, we examine the level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries. The first model is spin-1 XXZ chain $H$, the second model is obtained by Kennedy-Tasaki transformation $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$. We find that the level spacings of model $H$ follow the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). However, model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ only displays GOE statistics in some sectors after a "hidden non-local symmetry" is resolved, and the other sectors labeled by quantum numbers corresponding to the local symmetries exhibit non-GOE statistics. Additionally, a mapping relation between the levels in the sector $\{Z,X,I\}$ of model $H$ and the sector $\{Z,X,I'\}$ of model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ is found, where $Z,X,I$ correspond to the quantum numbers of $\pi$ rotation around $z,x$ axes and bond-centered inversion.</p>

            <p>The theory of superstatistics is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics which admits temperature fluctuations, and generates non-canonical ensembles from the distribution function of these fluctuations. Recently, some results have been presented showing that superstatistics is not universally applicable, but several conditions on the so-called fundamental inverse temperature function $\beta_F$ must be met by any superstatistical model. In this work we provide a set of neccessary and sufficient conditions for a non-equilibrium steady state model to be expressible by superstatistics, showing that $\beta_F$ by itself determines the existence of a superstatistical distribution of temperature.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the outcome of a study focused on the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar over 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage and capture its evolution in cement mortar hardening. During {\mu}XCT scans, the temperature released during the cement hydration was measured, which provided insight into the internal damage evolution with a link to a hydration temperature rise. The measured temperature during cement mortar hardening was compared with an analytical model, which showed a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the observed cement mortar hardening, it was possible to obtain a quantified characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse {\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed for studying the crack growth inside the meso-structure including its volume and surface characterisation. The results provide valuable insights into cement mortar shrinkage and serve as a proof-of-concept methodology for future material characterisation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Puyu Cao, Meicheng Yao, Bin Chen</p>
            <p>As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts possibly to a critical area density along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can provide a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Grünebohm</p>
            <p>Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.</p>

            <p>In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</p>

Typically, the half-Heusler systems exhibit topological features in a semimetallic state, and trivial ones in an insulating state. Topological properties of the most of half-Heusler systems are related to the band inversion around the Fermi level, similar to this observed in CdTe/HgTe systems. In the case of TmPdSb we observed the gapped electronic band structure with ``band inversion'' in the conductance band, while the slab-like system realized metallic surface states. The bulk insulating nature of the compound was corroborated by means of electrical transport measurements. The experimental data revealed several features due to the presence of metallic surface states, such as linear magnetoresistance and weak-antilocalization effect, characterized by enhanced coherence length and a very large number of surface conductive channels. Our findings reveal new features of the rare-earth half-Heusler.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, M. K. Chan, N. Harrison</p>
            <p>A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.</p>

            <p>Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas, along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of condensed matter physics and computational materials science.</p>

            <h2>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zou, Hai Zeng, Zhuo Wang, Guohao Dong, Xiaodong Guo, Fangjun Lu, Zengwei Zhu, Youguo Shi, Yifeng Yang, Yongkang Luo</p>
            <p>The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</p>

            <h2>Topological transition as a percolation of the Berry curvature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Byul Kim, Taewon Yuk, Sang-Jin Sin</p>
            <p>We first study the importance of the sign of the Berry curvature in the Euler characteristic of the two-dimensional topological material with two bands. Then we report an observation of a character of the topological transition as a percolation of the sign of the Berry curvature. The Berry curvature F has peaks at the Dirac points, enabling us to divide the Brillouin zone into two regions depending on the sign of the F: one with the same sign with a peak and the other with the opposite sign. We observed that when the Chern number is non-zero, the oppositely signed regions are localized. In contrast, in the case of a trivial topology, the oppositely signed regions are delocalized dominantly. Therefore, the oppositely signed region will percolate under the topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. We checked this for several models including the Haldane model, the extended Haldane model, and the QWZ model. Our observation may serve as a novel feature of the topological phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Shimizu, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P < 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P > 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</p>

            <p>Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Valley Degeneracy on Thermoelectric Properties of Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons with Staggered Sublattice Potentials and Transverse Electric Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M T Kuo</p>
            <p>This study investigates the band inversion of flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a tight-binding model. The band inversion results from symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through deposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or hexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic structures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which can be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function techniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with staggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier transport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above and below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze thermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level degeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT scenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily stems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Role of anisotropic confining potential and elliptical driving in dynamics of a Ge hole qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bashab Dey, John Schliemann</p>
            <p>The squeezing of a Ge planar quantum dot enhances the Rabi frequency of electric dipole spin resonance by several orders of magnitude due to a strong Direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction in such geometries (Bosco et al 2021 Phys. Rev. B 104 115425). We investigate the geometric effect of an elliptical (squeezed) confinement and its interplay with the polarization of driving field in determining the Rabi frequency of a heavy-hole qubit in a planar Ge quantum dot. To calculate the Rabi frequency, we consider only the p-linear SOIs viz. electron-like Rashba, hole-like Rashba and hole-like Dresselhaus which are claimed to be the dominant ones by recent studies on planar Ge heterostructures. We derive approximate analytical expressions of the Rabi frequency using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for small SOI and driving strengths. Firstly, for an out-of-plane magnetic field with magnitude B, we get an operating region with respect to B, squeezing and polarization parameters where the qubit can be operated to obtain 'clean' Rabi flips. On and close to the boundaries of the region, the higher orbital levels strongly interfere with the two-level qubit subspace and destroy the Rabi oscillations, thereby putting a limitation on squeezing of the confinement. The Rabi frequency shows different behaviour for electron-like and hole-like Rashba SOIs. It vanishes for right (left) circular polarization in presence of purely electron-like (hole-like) Rashba SOI in a circular confinement. For both in- and out-of-plane magnetic fields, higher Rabi frequencies are achieved for squeezed configurations when the ellipses of polarization and the confinement equipotential have their major axes aligned but with different eccentricities. We also deduce a simple formula to calculate the effective heavy hole mass by measuring the Rabi frequencies using this setup.</p>

            <h2>On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a three state opinion dynamics model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen</p>
            <p>A system of interacting walkers is considered in a two-dimensional hypothetical space, where the dynamics of each walker are governed by the opinion states of the agents of a fully connected three-state opinion dynamics model. Such walks, studied in different models of statistical physics, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along the Y-axis while it can move either way along the X-axis. The walk shows that there are three distinct regions as the noise parameter, responsible for driving a continuous phase transition in the model, is varied. In absence of any noise, the scaling properties and the form of the distribution along either axis do not follow any conventional form. For any finite noise below the critical point the bivariate distribution of the displacements is found to be a modified biased Gaussian function while above it, only the marginal distribution along one direction is Gaussian. The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well as in the exponents.</p>

            <h2>Analytical expression for $π$-ton vertex contributions to the optical conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juraj Krsnik, Anna Kauch, Karsten Held</p>
            <p>Vertex corrections from the transversal particle-hole channel, so-called $\pi$-tons, are generic in models for strongly correlated electron systems and can lead to a displaced Drude peak (DDP). Here, we derive the analytical expression for these $\pi$-tons, and how they affect the optical conductivity as a function of correlation length $\xi$, fermion lifetime $\tau$, temperature $T$, and coupling strength to spin or charge fluctuations $g$. In particular, for $T\rightarrow T_c$, the critical temperature for antiferromagnetic or charge ordering, the dc vertex correction is algebraic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \xi \sim (T-T_c)^{-\nu}$ in one dimension and logarithmic $\sigma_{VERT}^{dc}\propto \ln\xi \sim \nu \ln (T-T_c)$ in two dimensions. Here, $\nu$ is the critical exponent for the correlation length. If we have the exponential scaling $\xi \sim e^{1/T}$ of an ideal two-dimensional system, the DDP becomes more pronounced with increasing $T$ but fades away at low temperatures where only a broadening of the Drude peak remains, as it is observed experimentally, with the dc resistivity exhibiting a linear $T$ dependence at low temperatures. Further, we find the maximum of the DPP to be given by the inverse lifetime: $\omega_{DDP} \sim 1/\tau$. These characteristic dependencies can guide experiments to evidence $\pi$-tons in actual materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R.A. Abramchuk, M.A.Zubkov</p>
            <p>Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Xue, Pranay Gorantla, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</p>

This approach constitutes an alternative to using diagrammatic techniques directly as an impurity solver. It allows one to bypass the need of multiple perturbative series resummations within the DMFT self-consistency loop. It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.</p>

            <h2>Strange metals and planckian transport in a gapless phase from spatially random interactions</h2>

            <p>`Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a universal `planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiminori Hattori, Kenyu Chikamori, Hayato Iizuka, Ata Yamaguchi</p>
            <p>The Rice-Mele model consists of a one-dimensional lattice with two sublattice sites in each unit cell subjected to a staggered sublattice potential. The onsite potential constitutes a mass term that breaks chiral symmetry. In this paper, we show that a topological phase transition is induced in this model by disordering intracell and intercell hopping energies unequally, by means of a symmetry-independent global invariant. For small enough mass, the phase transition is accompanied by anomalous localization, which is accounted for in terms of geometric means of random variables. The specific disorder strength at which anomalous localization occurs is independent of mass. In contrast, the critical disorder strength at which the phase transition takes place decreases as mass increases, and eventually becomes invariable for large enough mass. For large enough mass, we show that the phase transition is characterized by arithmetic means instead of geometric means.</p>

            <p>The emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in electronic flow within clean, particle-hole-symmetric systems at half-filling is a non-trivial problem. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe the momentum flow, while experimental measurements typically capture the current flow profiles. However, in particle-hole-symmetric systems, electric current and momentum flow are entirely decoupled because electrons and holes move in opposite directions with equal distribution functions. This makes it challenging to link NS equations to observed flow patterns. In this work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current at half filling can emerge despite the absence of momentum flow. By combining Boltzmann transport theory with numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of clean graphene samples, we show that NS-type equations can be derived directly for the charge current, eliminating the need for any additional mechanism coupling the velocity field and charge current in explaining the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. We show that a new transport quantity - the current diffusion coefficient - replaces viscosity and expect this description to be valid for any particle-hole symmetric system. Our results provide new insights into the interpretation of experimental data and demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations can serve as an alternative to experiments in transport measurements to verify the kinetic theory results.</p>

            <p>Copper (Cu) segregation in medium and high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs) has shown significant influence on alloy properties. In this study, we investigate the effect of Cu segregation on evolution of irradiation-induced defects in FeNiCu, a model MEA, using hybrid molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Thermodynamically driven hybrid MC/MD annealing at low temperature resulted in a partially decomposed Cu-segregated structure (CSS) and was compared with a random solid solution (RSS) and pure Ni. Results through cumulative displacement cascades reveal that Cu-rich domains in CSS act as defect traps, accelerating interstitial-vacancy recombination and suppressing defect cluster growth. The complex potential energy landscape (PEL) in CSS disrupts dislocation propagation, leading to spatially dispersed networks. Notably, CSS exhibits reduced stair-rod dislocation density compared to RSS, highlighting its superior resistance to irradiation swelling. Localized shear strain causes dislocations to preferentially nucleate in/near Cu-rich regions though their growth is hindered by chemical heterogeneity of the alloy. Notably, prolonged irradiation induces slow Cu segregation in the RSS structure, while slowly annihilating pre-existing Cu clusters in CSS simultaneously. The findings provide atomic-scale insights into the interplay between Cu segregation and irradiation-induced defect evolution in MEAs.</p>

            <p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p>

            <p>We show that a quadratic form of quantum geometric tensor in $k$-space sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static structure factor $S(q)$ at small $\vec{q}$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a condition similar to Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as $\textit{harmonic bands}$. We provide examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems, including (higher) Landau levels. The geometric bound further leads to a topological bound on the $q^4$ term, which is saturated only when the band geometry satisfies the trace condition and, additionally, the quantum geometric tensor is uniform in $k$-space. We speculate that these bounds taken together provide a useful guide for identifying Chern bands that favor (Abelian or non-Abelian) fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Leahy, Andrew Treglia, Gang Cao, Brian Skinner, Minhyea Lee</p>
            <p>In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful in capturing electrical conductivity under magnetic field, as a function of density and mobility of electron-like and hole-like carriers. However, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with applied magnetic field, respectively. Such field dependence was predicted in previous work that studied a system of two parabolic bands, within semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:$\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. Under these conditions, we find the field dependence of the TE coefficients directly provides a relation between the electron-like ($n_e$) and hole-like ($n_h$) carrier densities, which in turn can be used to refine two-band model fitting. With this, we find the compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$) of NbSb$_2$ is two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in unrestricted fitting, resulting in a larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the same framework of the semiclassical theory, we also deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed as $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e} \times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$, which serves as a parameter to predict the degree of compensation. Our findings offer crucial insights into identifying empirical conditions for field-induced enhancement of TE performance and into engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</p>

            <p>Changes in the wavefunction's phase during propagation in a random Hermitian lattice, a process known as dephasing, results in diffusion rather than Anderson localization. However, when non-Hermiticity is introduced, the wave behavior changes drastically. In particular, we demonstrate that in weakly disordered non-Hermitian lattices, dephasing enhances eigenmode localization which results in abrupt jumps between spatially distant regions. These jumps, which are absent under purely coherent conditions, emerge from the interplay between complex disorder and dephasing.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuesong Hu, Junren Shi</p>
            <p>We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near these high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.</p>

            <h2>Soft symmetries of topological orders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <h2>Optical absorption and luminescence of $α$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction. The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$ orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength. We relate this to a recent experimental study of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic structure and dynamics of shear-thinning suspensions of polydisperse, repulsive vesicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolaos Kolezakis, Stefano Aime, Raffaele Pastore, Vincenzo Guida, Gaetano D Avino, Paolo Edera</p>
            <p>We investigate the rheology, microscopic structure, and dynamics of an industrially relevant dispersion made of cationic surfactant vesicles, from dilute to concentrated conditions. We find that these suspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively low concentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-defined transition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak in the static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down and develop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. This low-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light of experiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar composition the interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to propose that the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as an entropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled to crowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as the nonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Our work suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense, highly polydisperse charged suspensions.</p>

            <p>We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to an energetic landscape that defines three species: two distinct states of particles with a finite size, and point particles as an intermediate state between the two previous species. We show that the non-equilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayana Ezoe, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai</p>
            <p>Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Noguchi</p>
            <p>Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.</p>

            <h2>Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations in extended solids with substitutional disorder using a neural network potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoyo Hinuma</p>
            <p>Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Anisotropic ADPs by atom were directly derived from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal machine-learned potential. The (co)valences of atom positions were taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation. The procedure was demonstrated on extended solids, namely rocksalt structure MgO and three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in crystals with substitutional disorder and explicitly at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. The calculated ADP becomes ->0 at temperature ->0 and the ADP is proportional to the temperature when the atom is in a harmonic potential and the sole contribution to the actual non-zero ADP is from the zero-point motion. The zero-point motion contribution can be estimated from the proportionality constant assuming this Einstein model. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Xing Lin, Bastien Lapierre, Per Moosavi, Shinsei Ryu</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Naumann, Erik Lennart Weerda, Jens Eisert, Matteo Rizzi, Philipp Schmoll</p>
            <p>Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</p>

In this article, we report our results of a systematic study of longitudinal magnetoresistance in TaRhTe$_4$. Our findings indicate that magnetoresistance becomes negative only when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that its origin is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly, while the current jetting effect and weak localization could be excluded. The negative magnetoresistance persists up to room temperature, suggesting that TaRhTe4 exhibits distinctive properties within the family of Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Sahay, Curt von Keyserlingk, Ruben Verresen, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta > \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</p>

For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</p>

            <p>Active nematic flows in two dimensions, largely driven by motile $+1/2$ disclinations, mix themselves efficiently and exhibit chaos in the bulk steady state. Motivated by recent experimental findings for three-defect braiding in cardioid-shaped domains, we investigate how this tendency toward chaotic fluid mixing can, counterintuitively, produce certain ordered, periodic flows in confinement with a controllable net topological charge. We study two-dimensional active nematics in systems with boundary conditions requiring a prescribed number of excess $+1/2$ disclinations, using Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics simulations, alongside an agent-based, hydrodynamic simulation approach. We find ordered flows for systems of three and four defects, and we use tools from braid theory to show that spontaneously occurring periodic defect motions produce maximal topological entropy. Our theory correctly predicts the generic absence of stable periodic orbits of more than four defects in strong confinement in simulation. Our results identify the parameter regime outside of which periodicity is lost, and allow us to probe the limits of topological entropy production.</p>

            <p>The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. The Hall effect analysis in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ reveals both intriguing physical phenomena and methodological challenges. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. At low temperatures, upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE sharply increases and exceeds the conventional limits expected from intrinsic mechanisms. We also demonstrate the limitations of standard experimental methods in extracting the topological contribution to the Hall effect data. We show the importance of considering magnetoresistance anisotropy when estimating the anomalous and topological Hall effects. These shortcomings in current approaches in partitioning the Hall response necessitate new tools to interpret transport results in complex magnetic materials such as LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</p>

We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have emerged as a promising family of stable electrode materials for high-temperature water splitting. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in HEPOs significantly influences critical properties, such as the ionic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient. However, predicting oxygen vacancy concentrations for the design of HEPOs with high-entropic A-sites remains challenging due to the complex arrangements of metal cations. Our experimental findings reveal that variations in A-site cation size constitute a crucial factor in affecting the oxygen vacancy concentration. High-throughput atomistic simulations using a machine-learned universal interatomic potential reveal that the lattice distortions from A-site size variations result in a broadened distribution of oxygen vacancy formation energies. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical thermodynamics, provides formulations for the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen vacancy formation as functions of variance in oxygen bonding energy. Altogether, our results show mixing metal cations of varying sizes in the A-site creates statistical effects on the oxygen vacancy thermodynamics, resulting in a unique approach to tuning their concentrations for complex perovskite oxides.</p>

The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires away from the gapless regions.</p>

            <h2>Line defect correlators in fermionic CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julien Barrat, Pedro Liendo, Philine van Vliet</p>
            <p>Scalar-fermion models, such as the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, admit natural $1d$ defects given by the exponential of a scalar field integrated along a straight line. In $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions the defect coupling is weakly relevant and the setup defines a non-trivial interacting defect CFT. In this work we study correlation functions on these defect CFTs to order $\varepsilon$. We focus on $1d$ correlators constrained to the line, which include canonical operators like the displacement and the one-dimensional analog of the spin field. These results give access to perturbative CFT data that can be used as input in the numerical bootstrap. We also consider local operators outside the line, in particular two-point functions of scalars whose dynamics are non-trivial due to the presence of the defect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Landim, Jungkyoung Lee, Insuk Seo</p>
            <p>Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon>0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t>0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our analysis makes essential use of the hierarchical tree structure underlying the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiyu Zhou, Yi Teng, Claudio Chamon, Claudio Castelnovo, Armin Rahmani</p>
            <p>We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</p>

            <p>On-chip emitters that can generate single and entangled photons are essential building blocks for developing photonic quantum information processing technologies in a scalable fashion. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light on demand, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and low quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ivan Soler Calero, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f>1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</p>

            <h2>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in a Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiro Shimoda, Tomoki Wada</p>
            <p>Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches ~200 EeV, such as the Amaterasu particle. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of ~1 ZeV ion within a timescale of ~1 ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of ~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim$10 PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navid Abbasi, Dirk H. Rischke</p>
            <p>The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. Our results are important for future studies of the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Masi, Itai Einav</p>
            <p>The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</p>

            <p>Maximum structural chirality refers to the highest selectivity for circularly polarized light (CPL) in nanostructures, often manifested as maximum circular dichroism (CD), optical rotation (OR), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future investigations of chiral nanostructures.</p>

            <p>We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Becker, Zhongkai Tao, Mengxuan Yang</p>
            <p>This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</p>

To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.</p>

            <p>Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</p>

            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p>The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</p>

            <h2>Amending CALPHAD databases using a neural network for predicting mixing enthalpy of liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clement Vincely, Amin Reiners-Sakic, Vedant Dave, Erwin Povoden-Karadeniz, Elmar Rueckert, Ronald Schnitzer, David Holec</p>
            <p>In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring hBN's Phonon Polaritons with the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</h2>

            <p>Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.</p>

            <h2>Eta-pairing state in flatband lattice: Interband coupling effect on entanglement entropy logarithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seik Pak, Hanbyul Kim, Chan Bin Bark, Sang-Jin Sin, Jae-yoon Choi, Moon Jip Park</p>
            <p>The eta-pairing state is the eigenstate of the hypercubic Hubbard model, which exhibits anomalous logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. In multi-band systems, eta-pairing can be exact eigenstate when the band is flat without interband coupling. However, typical flatband systems such as Lieb and Kagome lattices often feature band touchings, where interband coupling effects are non-negligible. Using the Creutz ladder, we investigate the deformation of eta-pairing states under the interband coupling effect. Our results show corrections to entanglement entropy scaling, with modified eta-pairing states displaying broadened doublons, nonuniform energy spacing, and deviations from exact behavior for configurations with more than one eta-pair, even in the large band gap limit, except at t = 0. Through a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we quantify corrections to the spectrum generating algebra, offering insights into the interplay between interaction-driven phenomena and band structure effects. These findings illuminate the robustness and limitations of eta-pairing in realistic flatband systems.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic spin-blockade leakage current in a Ge hole double quantum dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanning Wang, S. D. Liles, Joe Hillier, A. R. Hamilton, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>Group IV quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures.</p>

            <p>On demand current-driven insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) is pivotal for the next generation of energy-efficient and scalable microelectronics. IMT is a key phenomenon observed in various quantum materials, and it is enabled by the complex interplay of spin, lattice, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom (DOF). Despite significant prior work, the underlying mechanism of the current-driven IMT remains elusive, primarily due to the difficulty in simultaneously obtaining bulk fingerprints of all the electronic DOF. Here, we employ in-operando resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, a prototypical strongly correlated material, to track the evolution of the electronic DOF encoded in the RIXS spectra during the current-driven IMT. Upon entering the conductive state, we observe an energy-selective suppression of the RIXS intensity, proportional to the current. Using complementary RIXS cross-section calculations, we demonstrate that the non-equilibrium conductive state emerges from the formation of correlated electronic states with a persistent Mott gap.</p>

            <p>Lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional properties. In the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites, ferroelastic domains formed during phase transitions enhance bulk transport and emissive efficiency. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing carrier dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ cathodoluminescence (CL) and micro-Raman spectroscopy to image and investigate the electronic properties of the ferroelastic domain walls in CsPbBr3 single crystals. CL measurements reveal a reduced emissive yield and a slight redshift in emission at the domain walls. Further, micro-Raman studies provide spatially resolved mapping of vibrational modes, exhibiting second-order phonon modes localized at the domain boundaries. Our findings suggest that electron-phonon coupling at twin domain walls plays a critical role in facilitating efficient charge separation, thereby improving the optoelectronic performance of the CsPbBr3 perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Alberto Ummarino, Alessio Zaccone, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Simoni, Gabriele Riva, Yuan Ping</p>
            <p>The theoretical description of materials' properties driven out of equilibrium has important consequences in various fields such as semiconductor spintronics, nonlinear optics, continuous and discrete quantum information science and technology. The coupling of a quantum many-body system to an external bath can dramatically modify its dynamics compared to that of closed systems, new phenomena like relaxation and decoherence appear as a consequence of the nonunitary evolution of the quantum system. In addition, electron-electron correlations must be properly accounted for in order to go beyond a simple one-electron or mean-field description of the electronic system. Here we discuss a first-principles methodology based on the evolution of the electronic density matrix capable of treating electron-environment interactions and electron-electron correlations at the same level of description. The effect of the environment is separated in a coherent contribution, like the coupling to applied external electro-magnetic fields, and an incoherent contribution, like the interaction with lattice vibrations or the thermal background of radiation. Electron-electron interactions are included using the nonequilibrium Green's function plus generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. The obtained non-Markovian coupled set of equations reduce to ordinary Lindblad quantum master equation form in the Markovian limit.</p>

            <h2>Correlated insulating states in slow Dirac fermions on a honeycomb moir{é} superlattice</h2>

            <p>Strong Coulomb repulsion is predicted to open a many-body charge gap at the Dirac point of graphene, transforming the semimetal into a Mott insulator. However, this correlated insulating phase has remained inaccessible in pristine graphene, where a large Fermi velocity dominates the interaction effects. To overcome this limitation, we realize a honeycomb moir{é} superlattice in a twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer, where a graphene-like band structure forms with a Fermi velocity reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude. These slow moir{é} bands are folded from the valence band maximum at the $\Gamma$ valley of the extended Brillouin zone with negligible spin-orbital coupling, and can therefore simulate massless Dirac fermions in the strongly correlated regime with full SU(2) symmetry. By correlating Rydberg exciton sensing with moir{é} trions of different spatial characters, we detect a Mott gap at the Dirac point that persists up to 110 K. We further identify correlated insulating states at $\nu=-1$ with a weak ferromagnetic coupling as well as at several fractional fillings. Our results highlight the potential of studying a wide range of quantum many-body phenomena in twisted two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Lowering Insulator-to-Metal Transition Temperature of Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films via Co-Sputtering, Furnace Oxidation and Thermal Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Jeremy Chao, Sydney Taylor, Liping Wang</p>
            <p>Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films have attracted much attention recently for constructing variable-emittance coatings upon its insulator-metal phase transition for dynamic thermal control. However, fabrication of high-quality vanadium dioxide thin films in a cost-effective way is still a challenge. In addition, the phase transition temperature of vanadium dioxide is around 68°C, which is higher than most of terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films with lowered phase transition temperatures via co-sputtering, furnace oxidation and thermal annealing processes for wider application needs. The doping is achieved by co-sputtering of tungsten and vanadium targets while the doping level is varied by carefully controlling the sputtering power for tungsten. Doped thin film samples of 30-nm thick with different tungsten atomic concentrations are prepared by co-sputtering onto undoped silicon wafers. Optimal oxidation time of 4 hours is determined to reach full oxidation in an oxygen-rich furnace environment at 300°C. Systematic thermal annealing study is carried out to find the optimal annealing temperature and time. By using an optical cryostat coupled to an infrared spectrometer, the temperature-dependent infrared transmittance of fully annealed tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films are measured in a wide temperature range from -60°C to 100°C. The phase transition temperature is found to decrease at 24.5°C per at.% of tungsten doping, and the thermal hysteresis between heating and cooling shrinks at 5.5°C per at.% from the fabricated vanadium dioxide thin films with tungsten doping up to 4.1 at.%.</p>

            <p>Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.</p>

            <p>Exciton-phonon interactions play a fundamental role in phonon-assisted radiative recombination and exciton dynamics in solids. In this work, we present a first-principles framework for computing phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes and exciton dynamics at finite temperatures. Starting from the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct an effective excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates both exciton-photon and exciton-phonon interactions. Phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes in anisotropic media are evaluated using time-dependent second-order perturbation theory. We further analyze the temperature and phonon-mode dependence of phonon-assisted radiative lifetime and compare our results with available experimental data. We explain the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the phonon-assisted radiative lifetime by different mechanisms at low and high-temperature regimes. Finally, we perform real-time exciton relaxation at the diagonal approximation of Lindbladian dynamics for time-resolved exciton occupation, providing insights into ultrafast thermalization and scattering pathways. Our ab-initio theory offers a detailed microscopic understanding of phonon-mediated exciton relaxation and recombination processes, and provides in-depth perspectives on phonon-assisted many-body interactions and their influence on optical properties for light-emitting and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>We propose an experimental scheme to realize phase transition from {\it dark superradiance} to conventional superradiance in a microwave cavity coupled to polar molecules. The competition between cavity-mediated infinite-range repulsions and finite-range attractive dipolar interactions stabilizes a variety of exotic quantum phases, including vortex, vortex anti-vortex pairs, and superradiant phase, all emerging without external driving fields. In vortex phase associated with {\it dark superradiance}, cavity remains in vacuum state while profoundly reshaping the condensate's ground-state wave functions. In particular, the spin configuration locally parallel but globally anti-parallel is a direct consequence of competing for two nonlocal interactions. Beyond Dicke paradigm, dipolar dressing of condensate enables access to an unexplored regime of repulsion-dominated superradiance. A Bogoliubov analysis of low-energy excitation spectrum confirms that the condensate remains stable, avoiding roton-maxon induced collapse even in strongly dipolar regime.</p>

Since compositional engineering plays an important role in optimizing material properties, we investigate the effect of alloying at Cs and Pb sites on the energetics and electronic structure of CsPbI$_{3}$ using cluster expansion method in combination with first-principles calculations. For Ge-mixing at Pb-site, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases are considered with emphasis on the electronic structure, transition probability, absorption coefficient, efficiency, and carrier mobility of higher-symmetry configurations. CsPb$_{0.50}$Ge$_{0.50}$I$_{3}$ (Cs$_{2}$PbGeI$_{6}$) which takes up a double perovskite (elpasolite) structure has a direct band gap with no parity-forbidden transitions. Further, we utilize the alloy entropic effect to improve the material stability and optoelectronic properties of CsPbI$_{3}$ by multi-element mixing. For the proposed mixed compositions, the Fr{ö}hlich electron-phonon coupling constant is determined. Scattering rates and electron mobility are obtained from first-principles inputs.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Hu, Weihang Zhao, Wenjun Xia, Hanbo Sun, Chao Wu, Yin-Zhong Wu, Ping Li</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnets demonstrate numerous newfangle physical phenomena due to their inherent antiferromagnetic coupling and spontaneous spin splitting, that are anticipated to enable innovative spintronic devices. However, the rare two-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet the requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the growth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti2Se2S with out-of-plane altermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic properties of altermagnet Ti2Se2S are highly dependent on the onsite electron correlation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y points are protected by the mirror Mxy symmetry rather than the time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and piezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley splitting of monolayer Ti2Se2S can be as high as ~500 meV. Most interestingly, the direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial strain, based on this, we have defined logical "0", "+1", and "-1" states for data transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic diagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in experimentally. Our findings have enriched the candidate materials of two-dimensional altermagnet for the ultra-fast and low power consumption device applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Min Jiang, Wen-Qian Dong, Shun-Li Yu, Z. D. Wang</p>
            <p>Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Schirmann, Peru d'Ornellas, Adolfo G. Grushin</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.</p>

            <p>SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe$_2$As$_2$ high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange-coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic-structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} > 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} < 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane magnetic structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically-calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron-scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.</p>

We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Hadi Yarloo, Hua-Chen Zhang, Klaus Mølmer, Anne E. B. Nielsen</p>
            <p>Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</p>

            <p>The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Learning of Quantum Dot Intensity Fluctuations under Excitation via Tailored Dynamic Mixture Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Yang, Hawi Nyiera, Yonglei Sun, Jing Zhao, Kun Chen</p>
            <p>Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have attracted significant attention for their unique fluorescence properties. Under continuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation: the intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short of addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from multiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized behaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model as its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity fluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are shared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few QD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization of intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current practice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs, we reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity transition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in providing deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application potential.</p>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <p>Dielectric spectroscopy is known as one of the most powerful techniques for studying ferroelectric and other polar materials. Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in Liquid Crystals, it has been successfully employed for the characterization of ferro-, antiferro- and ferri-electric liquid crystalline phases. However, recently the Boulder group raised the question of the applicability of dielectric spectroscopy for characterizing ferroelectric nematics due to parasitic effects from the insulating alignment layers. This affects the apparent/measured values of the dielectric permittivity. In this paper, we study this effect in greater detail. The following issues will receive special attention: Are the real values of dielectric permittivity lower or higher than the measured ones? Can the real values of dielectric permittivity be recovered in the cell with alignment layers? We also provide an example of the effect of insulating alignment layers in a non-ferroelectric nematic phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoqing Ding, Jinyuan Yao, Zhen Bi, Quyen Tran, Bangzhi Liu, Qi Li, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Thomas N. Jackson, Ying Liu</p>
            <p>Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.</p>

            <p>Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Błażej Jaworowski, Darrick E. Chang</p>
            <p>Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</p>

            <p>Magnetic bilayers consisting of an epitaxially grown ferrimagnetic insulator and a heavy metal layer are attractive for spintronic application because of the opportunity for electric control and read-out of spin textures via spin orbit torque. Here, we investigate ultrathin thulium iron garnet (TmIG)/Pt bilayers when the TmIG layer thickness is 3 nm and below using a sensitive Sagnac magneto-optical Kerr effect technique. We compare the hysteresis loops from out-of-plane and in-plane applied magnetic fields. The preferred magnetization orientation evolves with the TmIG thickness and the presence of the Pt overlayer. We quantify the evolution of the magnetic anisotropy in these ultrathin films and find a significant change even when the TmIG thickness is varied by less than 1 nm. In these ultrathin films, the presence of a Pt overlayer changes the effective anisotropy field by more than a factor of 2, suggesting that the interfacial anisotropy at the Pt/TmIG interface plays a critical role in this regime.</p>

            <h2>Weyl nodes and Kondo interaction in noncentrosymmetric semimetals RGaGe (R=La, Ce and Pr) with long Fermi arcs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Li</p>
            <p>In non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals based on rare-earth compounds, the correlation effects among $f$ electrons may play a crucial role in shaping the properties of Weyl nodes, potentially giving rise to magnetic Weyl semimetals or correlated Weyl excitations. Here, we investigates a recently identified class of magnetic rare-earth Weyl semimetals, RGaGe (R = La, Ce, and Pr). By employing a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations, we demonstrate that under ambient pressure, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe and PrGaGe are nearly fully localized. Concurrently, three inequivalent types of Weyl nodes emerge near the Fermi level due to intersections between $spd$ bands. Notably, one type of Weyl point exhibits substantial chiral separation (significantly greater than in CeAlSi and CeAlGe), leading to the formation of long and well-defined surface Fermi arcs on the (001) surface. These Fermi arcs remain well-separated by bulk states, thereby facilitating future experimental observations. In contrast, the chiral separation of Weyl points in LaGaGe is relatively modest. Upon application of volume compression, the $f$ electrons in CeGaGe progressively become itinerant and begin to obscure the Weyl nodes formed by $spd$ electrons, rendering them less accessible for direct observation. These findings suggest that in correlated materials, particularly $f$-electron systems, even when $f$ electrons do not directly contribute to the formation of topological nodes, they can still exert a profound influence on the characteristics of Weyl nodes.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric tensor is composed of the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which is observable by means of optical absorption of elliptically polarized light. Especially, the quantum geometric tensor at the zero-momentum is observable by the optical absorption at the optical band edge. In this context, we study optical absorption of a $p$-wave magnet under irradiation of elliptically polarized light. The $p$-wave magnet has a band splitting along one axis, which we choose the $x$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for the optical conductivity up to the second order in the magnitude of the Néel vector. In particular, the optical conductivity is exactly obtained when the Néel is along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis. It shows strong ellipticity a dependence of the light polarization, which is an elliptic dichroism. Especially, there is a perfect elliptic optical dichroism when the Néel vector is along the $y$ axis. It is possible to determine the Néel vector by measuring the ellipticity of the perfect elliptic dichroism.</p>

            <p>Driven quantum materials with on demand properties controlled by external stimuli are critical for emergent quantum technology. In optically tunable superconducting heterostructures, the lattice responses at the buried interface may hold the key to the light susceptibility but is very challenging to detect. In this work, a nondestructive synchrotron-based X-ray scattering phase-retrieval technique is implemented in monolayer-FeSe/SrTiO3 heterostructures to capture the three-dimensional interfacial atomic displacements in-situ as the interface superconductivity is actively manipulated by light. It is found that the interlayer sliding between FeSe and SrTiO3 can drastically alter how the lattice responds to the light. In domains with selected stacking configurations, the interface transforms the very weak photoexcitation in SrTiO3 into significant Fe-atom displacements in FeSe and generate metastable interfacial structures that can lead to a persistent superconductivity enhancement. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving greatly amplified light-lattice coupling for efficient quantum phase manipulations at designed interfaces.</p>

            <p>We implement a new experimental approach to directly measure the lifetime of guided polaritons arising from the strong-coupling of GaN excitons and the guided photonic modes of a slab waveguide. Using a Fourier imaging setup, combined with spatial filtering of the emission, the emission associated to polaritonic modes with well-defined propagation constants can be selectively analyzed in the temporal domain. By directing it to the entrance slit of a streak camera, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements along the polariton dispersion branch were performed at 40 K, enabling to assess the time decay of polariton modes. By combining this information with the photonic/excitonic fraction corresponding to each polariton mode, extracted from a coupled-oscillators model that indicate a Rabi splitting of $\Omega$ = 80 meV, we could extract the photon lifetime in the waveguide $\tau_\gamma\, =\, 3\pm 1$ ps. This corresponds to a record $Q$-factor in the UV of 16 000. The excitonic reservoir lifetime, which contributes to polariton formation, was determined through TRPL measurements on excitonic luminescence. Finally, measurements conducted at lower temperature highlight secondary feeding mechanisms for the guided polaritonic mode, either via photon recycling from the AlGaN cladding layer or through resonant injection of photons from transitions below the band gap.</p>

By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the plethora of different implementations of such systems.</p>

            <p>When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-Pérot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Shekhter, B. J. Ramshaw, M. K. Chan, N. Harrison</p>
            <p>A major puzzle in understanding high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, which persists up to very high temperatures. Implicit to existing theoretical discussions of this universal `{Planckian}' relaxation rate is the assumption that it must also be independent of doping, $p$. Applied to the cuprates, however, this apparently contradicts the observed strong doping-dependence ($\propto 1/p$) of the slope of the $T$-linear resistivity over a wide doping range. Here, we show through a combination of measurements, including optical conductivity and entropy, that the plasma frequency squared $\omega_p^2$ scales as $p$ over a similar doping range. Together, these dependences provide compelling evidence that the relaxation rate $1/\tau$ is indeed doping-independent (i.e. universal) throughout the entire strange metal state. Furthermore, we argue that the entire doping dependence of $\omega_p^2$ can be understood to arise from an effective mass enhancement of a specific form proposed by Anderson [\emph{Science} \textbf{235}, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. Such a mass enhancement originates from strong short-range repulsive interactions, while the Planckian relaxation rate itself appears to be an emergent phenomenon of independent physical origin.</p>

For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moiré heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Harnessing Chiral Spin States in Molecular Nanomagnets for Quantum Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Ullah, Ziqi Hu, Juan Aragó, Alejandro Gaita-Ariño</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical framework to investigate spin chirality in molecular quantum systems. Focusing on a minimal three-spin-center model with antiferromagnetic exchange and symmetry breaking driven by an electric-field-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and applied magnetic fields-give rise to chiral ground states characterized by nonzero scalar spin chirality, $\chi = \textbf{S}_1\cdot(\textbf{S}_r\times \textbf{S}_2)$. The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</h2>

            <p>Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate $La_3Ni_2O_7$ has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of ~ 80 K above 14 GPa$^{[1-4]}$. Efforts to search for nickelate superconductors with higher $T_c$$^{[5,6]}$, to grow reproducible high-quality single crystals$^{[2,7-10]}$, and to eliminate reliance on demanding high gas pressure synthesis conditions$^{[11]}$, remain significant challenges. Here we report superconductivity up to 92 K under high pressure in single crystals of bilayer nickelates synthesized at ambient pressure using flux methods. High quality $La_2SmNi_2O_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals with dimensions up to 220 {\mu}m on edge were successfully grown. At ~ 15 GPa, these crystals exhibit superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c^{onset}$) of 68 K and zero-resistance temperature ($T_c^{zero}$) of 47 K. Increasing pressure further enhances both transition temperatures, reaching record values for nickelates: $T_{c,max}^{onset}$ = 92 K and $T_{c,max}^{zero}$ = 73 K @ 21 GPa. Notably, higher $T_c$ correlates with larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions for bilayer nickelates. Furthermore, we observed a structural transition from monoclinic $P2_1/a$ to tetragonal $I4/mmm$ at ~ 18 GPa, indicating that tetragonal structure is not a prerequisite for superconductivity to appear in this bilayer nickelate. This study provides an easy-to-access method for growing reproducible high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals and offers new insights into achieving higher Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Paired Superfluidity and Quantum Quadruple Criticality in Synthetic-Dimension-Engineered Bose Mixtures: Phase-Dependent Demixing and Emergent XY Ferromagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenrong Liu, Zhi Lin</p>
            <p>We utilize the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method to explore ground-state phases and demixing effects in synthetic-dimensional binary boson mixtures with pair hopping. Our investigation uncovers two exotic interspecies paired superfluids: (i) the PSCF phase, characterized by bosonic `four-particle' correlations (two particles of one species paired with two holes of the other), analogous to fermionic charge-4e superconductivity; (ii) the SCF$^*$ phase, hosting coexisting PSCF and super-counter-fluidity orders, serves as the bosonic analog of fermionic charge-2e/4e superconducting coexistence. Both phases exhibit distinct XY ferromagnetic states at varying fillings, including unreported pseudo-spin phases. A quantum quadruple critical point emerges under interexchange asymmetry. Crucially, pair hopping introduces phase-dependent mixed-demixed criticality, deviating from conventional two-component bosonic systems. We propose experimental protocols leveraging noise correlations and Feshbach resonance techniques to probe these states.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna N. Morozovska, Salia Cherifi-Hertel, Eugene A. Eliseev, Victoria V. Khist, Riccardo Hertel, Dean R. Evans</p>
            <p>This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</p>

            <h2>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Banerjee</p>
            <p>The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</p>

            <h2>Topological Origin of Andreev Flatland in UTe$_2$: Implication for Josephson STM Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jushin Tei, Takeshi Mizushima, Satoshi Fujimoto</p>
            <p>We propose the surface of topological superconductors as a platform for realizing two-dimensional flat bands, where electron interactions play a crucial role. The surface flat bands originate from topological features supported by two key mechanisms: (1) a trivial Chern number prevents the zero-energy states from merging into the continuum of the bulk spectrum, thereby ensuring their confinement within the superconducting gap; and (2) weak spin conservation allows the gap function to exhibit phase winding. As a consequence, the surface exhibits a remarkably high density of states at nearly zero energy. Such surface states are likely to be realized in the candidate topological superconductor UTe$_2$. Our results provide important insights into the interpretation of recent Josephson STM experiments on UTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</p>

            <h2>Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Skliannyi, Yuval Oreg, Ady Stern</p>
            <p>We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Liang, Yuan Xie, Dongyang Yang, Shangyi Guo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jerry I. Dadap, David Jones, Ziliang Ye</p>
            <p>High-speed, non-volatile tunability is critical for advancing reconfigurable photonic devices used in neuromorphic information processing, sensing, and communication. Despite significant progress in developing phase change and ferroelectric materials, achieving highly efficient, reversible, rapid switching of optical properties has remained a challenge. Recently, sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in 2D semiconductors, which also host strong excitonic effects. Here, we demonstrate that these materials enable nanosecond ferroelectric switching in the complex refractive index, largely impacting their linear optical responses. The maximum index modulation reaches about 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and off switching occurs within 2.5 nanoseconds, with switching energy at femtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic peak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered Coulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new direction for developing high-speed, non-volatile optical memories and highly efficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices. Additionally, the demonstrated imaging technique offers a rapid method to characterize domains and domain walls in 2D semiconductors with rhombohedral stacking.</p>

            <h2>Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Simon</p>
            <p>We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, the quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our achievement opens a new avenue to explore topological superconductivity for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of LuOs3B2, characterized by an ideal Os-based kagome lattice. Resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the emergence of type-II bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc=4.63 K. The specific heat jump and the calculated electron-phonon coupling parameter support a moderately coupled superconducting state. Electron correlation effects are supported by the enhanced Wilson ratios. First-principles calculations reveal hallmark features of kagome band structure, including Dirac points, van Hove singularities, and quasi-flat bands, primarily derived from the Os d orbitals. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling opens a gap at the Dirac points, significantly altering the electronic properties. Furthermore, the superconductivity and electronic properties of isomorphic compounds are discussed. This work provides a thorough exploration of the superconducting and normal states of LuOs3B2, deepening the understanding of kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin-dependent electron transport in Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin-transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and the effect of substitutional doping of magnetic impurity Cr on the spin-transport of the junctions is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows presence of metal induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2 interface and the effect of the interface is limited to the first two layers of MoS2 from the interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three-layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunneling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven-layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity, we have shown that spin-polarisation in the spacer is improved, thus increasing the spin-polarised current. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. The close packed Fe(111) surface is better electrode material for tunneling of electrons through the junction compared to the Fe(001) surface due to lower surface energy and reduced transmission.</p>

            <p>Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.</p>

Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p>In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</p>

            <p>We investigate the multimagnon and the multispinon $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of a spin-1/2 effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model in its Néel ordered phase. Motivated by the observation of satellite intensity peaks above the single magnon dispersion in the $L$-edge RIXS spectrum, we propose a resonating valence bond (RVB) inspired RIXS mechanism that incorporates the local site ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) expansion. We compute the multimagnon and the multispinon excitations using $\mathcal{O}(1/S)$ interacting spin wave theory and Schwinger boson mean-field theory (SBMFT) formalism, respectively. We treat the x-ray scattering process up to second order in the UCL expansion. Our calculations of two-magnon, bimagnon, and three-magnon RIXS intensities reveal that interacting spin wave theory fails to fully capture all the quantum correlations in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase. However utilizing the SBMFT framework, with a ground state that combines Néel order and fluctuating RVB components, we demonstrate that a RIXS bond-flipping mechanism provides an alternative deeper physical explanation of the satellite intensities. Specifically, we find that the spin correlation spectra predicted by the fluctuating RVB mechanism aligns with higher order UCL expansion results. We further show that the satellite intensity above the single-magnon mode can originate both from a one-to-three-magnon hybridization vertex process and from condensed spinons exhibiting Higgs mechanism. These features reflect the interplay of quantum fluctuation, entanglement, and gauge interaction effects of quantum magnetism probed by RIXS.</p>

            <h2>Optical-vortex-pulse induced nonequilibrium spin textures in spin-orbit coupled electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunki Yamamoto, Masahiro Sato, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima</p>
            <p>Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.</p>

            <h2>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piper Fowler-Wright, Michael Reitz, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p>Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that terahertz cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Brehm, Paweł Sobieszczyk, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</p>
            <p>The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Arrufat-Vicente, David Mukamel, Stefano Ruffo, Nicolo Defenu</p>
            <p>Ensemble inequivalence occurs when a systems thermodynamic properties vary depending on the statistical ensemble used to describe it. This phenomenon is known to happen in systems with long-range interactions and has been observed in many classical systems. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of a long-range quantum ferromagnet spin model that exhibits ensemble inequivalence. At zero temperature ($T = 0$), the microcanonical phase diagram matches that of the canonical ensemble. However, the two ensembles yield different phase diagrams at finite temperatures. This behavior contrasts with the conventional understanding in statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions, where thermodynamic properties are expected to align across different ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We discuss the implications of these findings for synthetic quantum long-range platforms, such as atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems.</p>

            <p>Recently, the unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order with loop currents has attracted considerable attention in the Kagome material family AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). However, experimental signatures of loop current order remain elusive. In this work, based on the mean-field free energy, we analyze the collective modes of unconventional CDW order in a Kagome lattice model. Furthermore, we point out that phase modes in the imaginary CDW (iCDW) order with loop current orders result in time-dependent stray fields. We thus propose using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to detect these time-dependent stray fields, providing a potential experimental approach to identifying loop current order.</p>

            <h2>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duy-Nhat Ly, Dai-Nam Le, Dang-Khoa D. Le, Van-Hoang Le</p>
            <p>We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{ö}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.</p>

            <h2>Bulk photogalvanic current control and gap spectroscopy in 2D hexagonal materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Galler, Ofer Neufeld</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials have been intensively explored for multiple optoelectronic applications such as spin current generation, all-optical valleytronics, and topological electronics. In the realm of strong-field and ultrafast light-driven phenomena, it was shown that tailored laser driving such as polychromatic or few-cycle pulses can drive robust bulk photogalvanic (BPG) currents originating from the K/K' valleys. We here explore the BPG effect in 2D systems in the strong-field regime and show that monochromatic elliptical pulses also generically generate such photocurrents. The resultant photocurrents exhibit both parallel and transverse (Hall-like) components, both highly sensitive to the laser parameters, providing photocurrent control knobs. Interestingly, we show that the photocurrent amplitude has a distinct behavior vs. the driving ellipticity that can be indicative of material properties such as the gap size at K/K', which should prove useful for novel forms of BPG-based spectroscopies. We demonstrate these effects also in benchmark ab-initio simulations in monolayer hexagonal boron-nitride. Our work establishes new paths for controlling photocurrent responses in 2D systems that can also be used for multi-dimensional spectroscopy of ultrafast material properties through photocurrent measurements.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna N. Morozovska, Salia Cherifi-Hertel, Eugene A. Eliseev, Victoria V. Khist, Riccardo Hertel, Dean R. Evans</p>
            <p>This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</p>

            <h2>General trends of electronic structures, superconducting pairing, and magnetic correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate $m$-layered superconductors La$_{m+1}$Ni$_{m}$O$_{3m+1}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Satoshi Okamoto, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto</p>
            <p>We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6) under pressure. Our results suggest that, while these Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates display many similarities, they also show noticeable differences. The Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals display bonding-antibonding, or bonding-antibonding-nonbonding, characteristic splittings, depending on the even or odd number of stacking layers $m$. In addition, the ratio of the in-plane interorbital hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and in-plane intraorbital hopping between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals was found to be large in La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6), and this ratio increases from $m = 1$ to $m = 6$, suggesting that the in-plane hybridization will increase as the layer number $m$ increases. In contrast to the dominant $s^\pm$--wave state driven by spin fluctuations in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, two nearly degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s^\pm$-wave leading states were obtained in the four-layer stacking La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and five-layer stacking La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$. The leading $s^\pm$-wave state was recovered in the six-layer material La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$. In general, at the level of the random phase approximation treatment, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ decreases in stoichiometric bulk systems from the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to the six-layer La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, despite the $m$ dependent dominant pairing. Both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations are found to be quite complex. Within the in-plane direction, we obtained the peak of the magnetic susceptibility at ${\bf q} = (0.6 \pi, 0.6 \pi)$ for La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, and at ${\bf q} = (0.7 \pi, 0.7 \pi)$ for La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$.</p>

            <p>We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional ``level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</p>

            <p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, fractionalized excitations, and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion (CF) theory. In this paper, we assess how DFT addresses major challenges in FQH system, such as computing ground state and low-energy excitations. We emphasize the critical insights provided by DFT-based methods into the CF model, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. Furthermore, we examine the advantages and limitations of DFT approaches, highlight the interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models.

            <p>``Unconventional magnetism" was proposed to describe the exotic states arising from Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel nearly two decades ago. Its odd-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $p$-wave) states break parity giving rise to the dynamic generation of spin-orbit coupling, while its even-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $d$-wave) states break time-reversal symmetry. Both types of states can exhibit collinear and non-collinear spin configurations over Fermi surfaces with the former and latter termed as the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases, respectively. The collinear states in even partial-wave channels are in the same symmetry class of ``altermagnetism". In this work, we investigate unconventional magnetism in both $p$- and $d$-wave channels within spin-orbit coupled systems with parity and time-reversal symmetries maintained. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the $p$-wave channel yields the gyrotropic, Rashba, Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit couplings. They compete and mix evolving from the $\beta$-phase to the $\alpha$-phase with various types of spin-momentum lockings. Analyses are performed in parallel for the $d$-wave unconventional magnetism. We emphasize that the single-particle dispersion is not sufficient to justify the spin-group type symmetry of the full Hamiltonian. Furthermore, Goldstone manifolds and excitations are examined in each unconventional magnetic phase.</p>

            <p>A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</p>

            <p>The introduction of intrinsic magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offers great opportunities for investigating correlated excitonic phenomena. Here, we employ full-spinor GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation methodology to reveal rich exciton physics in a prototypical 2D Néel-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$, enabled by the interplay among inverted dispersion of the second valence band, spin-valley coupling and magnetic order. The negative hole mass increases the reduced mass of the lowest-energy bright exciton, leading to exchange splitting enhancement of the bright exciton relative to band-edge dark exciton. Notably, such splitting couples with spontaneous valley polarization to generate distinct excitonic fine structure between $K$ and $-K$ valleys, which dictate distinct relaxation behaviors. Crucially, magnetic order transition from Néel antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state induces significant quasiparticle band structure reconstruction and excitonic transitions modification, with low-energy optical excitations being exclusively contributed by majority-spin channel. These findings establish 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors as an intriguing platform to study band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics.</p>

            <p>The discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in H3S sparked experimental and theoretical studies of highly compressed hydrides with the aim of obtaining room-temperature superconductivity. There are two dominant hydride classes where the search is ongoing: the first class is the covalently bonded hydrides (which is represented by H3S), and the second class is the clathrate-type hydrides (which is represented by LaH10, YH6, CaH6). Recently, the third class of superconducting hydrides, where the hydrogen remains its molecular form, has been discovered. This class is represented by BaH12 and BiH4. Here, we analyzed experimental data for the BaH12 and BiH4. We found that the BaH12 exhibits grains of an average size of 26 nm and a low level of microstrain 0.1%, in the range of 126 GPa < P < 160 GPa. We also derived the Debye $\Theta_D$ and Einstein $\Theta_E$ temperatures, and the electron-phonon coupling constant $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BaH12 and BiH4. The $\Lambda_{e-ph} $ in BiH4 significantly differs from the values obtained by first-principles calculations. The derived Fermi temperature $T_F = 20,000 K$ for BiH4 positions this molecular hydride between the unconventional and conventional superconductors bands in the Uemura plot. This position is outside of the band where covalently bonded and clathrate hydrides are located. The ratio $\Theta_D / T_F = 0.026 $ of BiH4 is typical for pure metals and A-15 alloys. This implies that the BiH4, is the first hydride superconductor which complains with the Migdal's theorem.</p>

            <p>Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (FnGD) has gained popularity in the recent times owing to it's ubiquity in a variety of complex fluids. However, whether FnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with very little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in molecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that while the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is restored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion (NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show their universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that cage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework of NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.</p>

            <p>Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karim Aljamal, Xiao Wang</p>
            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energetics between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the model qualitatively predicts adsorption properties for the original unaltered MOFs, it fails to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects significantly impact adsorption behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</p>

            <p>The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{\textrm{c}} = 0.35\, \textrm{K}$) shows two superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the $c$ axis of the tetragonal unit cell. All experiments to date indicate that the change in SC order parameter detected at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*} \approx 4\, \textrm{T}$ is due to strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites caused by the locally non-centrosymmetric environments of the otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystalline structure. Another phase (phase I) exists in this material below $T_{\textrm{0}} = 0.54\, \textrm{K}$. In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys. Rev. B, $107$, L220504 (2023)] we have shown that phase I persists up to a field $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H_{0} \approx 6\, \textrm{T}$, larger than $H^{*}$. From thermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase SC2 at a tetracritical point. However, we could not find any signature of the phase-I line inside the SC2 phase and speculated that this was due to the fact that the $T_{0}(H)$ line is almost perpendicular to the $H$ axis and, therefore, invisible to $T$-dependent measurements. This would imply a weak competition between the two order parameters. Here, we report magnetic field dependent measurements of the magnetostriction and ac-susceptibility on high-quality single crystals. We see clear evidence of the singularity at $H_{0}$ inside the SC2 phase and confirm our previous prediction. Furthermore, we observe the transition across the $T^{*}(H)$ line in $T$-dependent specific heat measurements, which show that the $T^{*}(H)$ line is not perpendicular to the field axis, but has a positive slope. Our work supports recent $\mu$SR results which suggest coexistence of phase I with superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Spin dynamics and 1/3 magnetization plateau in a coupled distorted diamond chain compound K2Cu3(MoO4)4</h2>

            <p>We investigate magnetic properties of the $s$ = 1/2 compound K$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$(MoO$_{4}$)$_{4}$ by combining magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, and electron spin resonance (ESR) with density functional calculations. Its monoclinic structure features alternating Cu$^{2+}$ ($s$ = 1/2) monomers and edge-shared dimers linked by MoO$_{4}$ units, forming a distorted diamond chain along the $a$-axis. Antiferromagnetic order occurs at $T_{\rm N}$ = 2.3 K, as evident from a $\lambda$-type anomaly in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility derivatives. Inverse magnetic susceptibility reveals coexisting ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. Specific heat and ESR data show two characteristic temperatures: one at 20 K, associated with spin-singlet formation in Cu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimers, and another at 3.68 K, indicating short-range correlations between dimers and monomers. Magnetization measurements reveal a metamagnetic transition at 2.6 T and a critical magnetic field $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ = 3.4 T, where a 1/3 magnetization plateau emerges with saturation near 0.35 $\mu_{\rm B}$. Low-temperature specific heat and magnetization data reveal the suppression of long-range order at $\mu_{0}H_{c}$, enabling the construction of a temperature-magnetic field phase diagram showing multiple magnetic phases near the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. Density functional theory confirms a distorted diamond chain with $J_{1}$ dimers and competing $J_2$, $J_4$, $J_3$, and $J_5$ interactions with monomer spins as an effective low-temperature spin model.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectric materials allow the direct conversion of waste heat into electricity, and novel materials are being investigated for this purpose. Recently, doped Bi$_2$O$_2$Se has shown high application potential. In this study, we discuss causes for large variation in reported transport properties of pure Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and present a preparation method that improves the reproducibility of undoped polycrystalline samples and improves their stability under thermal cycling. Key steps of this method include calcination of the Bi$_2$O$_3$ precursor, purification of the synthesized material in a temperature gradient, use of a coarse particle fraction and compaction of the powders in a Si3N4 die instead of a graphite die. The resulting polycrystalline material exhibits improved reproducibility and enhanced resistance to thermal cycling. It has room temperature electrical conductivity {\sigma}RT ~ 500 S.m-1 and Seebeck coefficient S ~ -300 $\mu$V.K$^{-1}$. These properties make it suitable as a reference material for future doping studies. The presented synthesis approach may provide a more reliable platform for investigating the intrinsic behavior and doping response of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se in thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <h2>Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Blanik, José Garre-Rubio, Norbert Schuch</p>
            <p>Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.</p>

            <p>Superconducting transition-edge sensors are renowned for their extraordinary photon sensitivity and energy resolution, finding applications spanning quantum information, astronomy, and nanophotonics. Here, we report the development of BOlometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels--at least four orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning probe based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale. This paves the way for quantum sensing applications using single-polariton detection and can offer deeper insights into quasiparticle dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Giacomelli, Michel H. Devoret, Cristiano Ciuti</p>
            <p>We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamoghna Ray, Abhishek Dhar, Manas Kulkarni</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imad-Eddine Chorfi, Nacer eddine Belaloui, Abdellah Tounsi, Achour Benslama, Mohamed Taha Rouabah</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</p>

            <p>Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</p>

            <p>The traditional techniques for extracting polycrystalline grain structures from microscopy images, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are labour-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming, limiting their scalability for high-throughput analysis. In this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise, and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.</p>

In this work, we present an optimized methodology for stopping power measurements using the backscattering technique, with a focus on minimizing both random and systematic uncertainties. By systematically analyzing the sources of uncertainty and refining the experimental geometry, we establish a robust framework for high-precision measurements. Our approach was applied to the stopping power of helium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully chosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and systematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide energy range.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Banerjee</p>
            <p>The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</p>

            <p>In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state.</p>

            <p>We examine the spectral properties of a recently proposed theory of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of the cuprates. We show that this theory can be obtained from the familiar paramagnon theory of nearly antiferromagnetic metals by fractionalizing the paramagnon into two `hidden' layers of S=1/2 spins. The first hidden layer of spins hybridizes with the electrons as in a Kondo lattice heavy Fermi liquid, while the second hidden layer of spins forms a spin liquid with fractionalized spinon excitations. We compute the imaginary part of the electronic self energy induced by the spinon excitations. The energy and momentum dependence of the photoemission spectrum across the Brillouin zone provides a good match to observations by He et al. in Bi2201 (Science 331, 1579 (2011)) and by Chen et al. in Bi2212 (Science 366, 1099 (2019)).</p>

            <p>The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications. Examples include assessing the extent of tissue ablation during histotripsy procedures and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al., 2018) allows for the characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR now typically relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at >1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. Here, we present an improved IMR-style technique, called parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheometry (pIMR), that parsimoniously characterizes surrounding viscoelastic materials. The pIMR approach uses experimental advancements to estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity within approximately 20 ns and a theoretical energy balance analysis that yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The pIMR method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds while potentially reducing reliance on ultra-high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials with a numerical criterion assessing the correct choice of model. We illustrate the efficacy of the technique on batches of tens of experiments for both soft hydrogels and fluids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maine Christos, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We model the pseudogap state of the hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a metal with hole and/or electron pocket Fermi surfaces. In the absence of long-range antiferromagnetism, such Fermi surfaces violate the Luttinger requirement of enclosing the same area as free electrons at the same density. Using the Ancilla theory of such a pseudogap state, we describe the onset of conventional $d$-wave superconductivity by the condensation of a charge e Higgs boson transforming as a fundamental under the emergent SU(2) gauge symmetry of a background $\pi$-flux spin liquid. In all cases, we find that the $d$-wave superconductor has gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points on the Brillouin zone diagonals with significant velocity anisotropy, just as in the BCS state. This includes the case of the electron-doped pseudogap metal with only electron pockets centered at wavevectors $(\pi, 0)$, $(0, \pi)$, and an electronic gap along the zone diagonals. Remarkably, in this case too, gapless nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge within the gap at 4 points along the zone diagonals upon the onset of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The unexpected discovery of superconductivity and strong electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a system containing only sp electrons, is considered as one of the most intriguing developments in two-dimensional materials in recent years. The key feature is the emergent flat energy bands near the Fermi level, a favorable condition for novel many-body phases, at the so-called "magic angles". The physical origin of these interesting flat bands has been elusive to date, hindering the construction of an effective theory for the unconventional electron correlation. In this work, we have identified the importance of charge accumulation in the AA region of the moire supercell and the most critical role of the Fermi ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We show that the magic angles can be predicted by the moire periodicity determined by the size of this Fermi ring. The resonant criterion in momentum space makes it possible to coherently combine states on the Fermi ring through scattering by the moire potential, leading to flat bands near the Fermi level. We thus establish the physical origin of the magic angles in TBG and identify the characteristics of one-particle states associated with the flat bands for further many-body investigations.</p>

            <h2>A study for the energy structure of the Mott system with a low-energy excitation, in terms of the pseudo-gap in HTSC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keishichiro Tanaka</p>
            <p>The Mott system with a low-energy excitation may well constitute the underlying system for high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) of under-doped cuprates. This manuscript explores the above through the Hubbard-1 approximation (the Green function method), especially in terms of its self-energy while evaluating the calculation of self-energy using effective mass ratio. Results show it appears the pseudo-gap of HTSC is due to the self-energy effect on the quasi-particle excitation of the Mott's J.</p>

            <h2>Mechanical cosmology: simulating scalar fluctuations in expanding Universes using synthetic mechanical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan Rhyno, Ivan Velkovsky, Peter Adshead, Bryce Gadway, Smitha Vishveshwara</p>
            <p>Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios described by the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and feedback-coupled mechanical oscillators. As proof-of-principle, we then perform experiments on a synthetic mechanical lattice composed of such oscillators. We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios with Universes dominated by vacuum energy and matter and discuss our experimental results.</p>

            <h2>Ground state phase diagram and the exotic phases in the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianwei Yang, Zhao Liu, Ling Wang</p>
            <p>The intricate interplay between frustration and spin chirality has the potential to give rise to unprecedented phases in frustrated quantum magnets. We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL, exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.</p>

            <h2>Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Sipling, Y.-H. Zhang, M. Di Ventra</p>
            <p>Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency operations and improved insensitivity to magnetic fields compared to ferromagnetic spintronics. However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have utilized large, millimeter-scale bulk crystals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in structures on the few-micrometer scale using spin-filter tunneling in PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high frequency dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Gao, Ryan A. Lanzetta, Patrick Ledwith, Jie Wang, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The bootstrap method aims to solve problems by imposing constraints on the space of physical observables, which often follow from physical assumptions such as positivity and symmetry. Here, we employ a bootstrap approach to study interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level by minimizing the energy as a function of the static structure factor subject to a set of constraints, bypassing the need to construct the full many-body wavefunction. This approach rigorously lower bounds the ground state energy, making it complementary to conventional variational upper bounds. We show that the lower bound we obtain is relatively tight, within at most 5\% from the ground state energy computed with exact diagonalization (ED) at small system sizes, and generally gets tighter as we include more constraints. In addition to energetics, our results reproduce the correct power law dependence of the pair correlation function at short distances and the existence of a large entanglement gap in the two-particle entanglement spectra for the Laughlin states at $\nu = 1/3$. We further identify signatures of the composite Fermi liquid state close to half-filling. This shows that the bootstrap approach is capable, in principle, of describing non-trivial gapped topologically ordered, as well as gapless, phases. At the end, we will discuss possible extensions and limitations of this approach. Our work establishes numerical bootstrap as a promising method to study many-body phases in topological bands, paving the way to its application in moiré platforms where the energetic competition between fractional quantum anomalous Hall, symmetry broken, and gapless states remains poorly understood.</p>

            <h2>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in Bose gases at thermal equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexej Schelle</p>
            <p>The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain symmetry aspects of non-interacting and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</p>

            <p>The deformation behavior of single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel were studied using in situ micropillar compression experiments from quasi-static to high strain rates up to 10^3 s-1. Deformation occurred by dislocation slip activity in single crystal nickel whereas extensive grain boundary sliding was observed in nanocrystalline nickel, with a shift towards more inhomogeneous, localized deformation above 1 s-1. The strain rate sensitivity exponent was found to change at higher strain rates for both single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel, while the overall strain rate sensitivity was observed to be of the same value for both. With increasing high strain rate micropillar compression tests being reported, the issue of adiabatic heating in micropillars becomes important. We report crystal plasticity based finite element modeling to estimate the adiabatic heating, spatially resolved within the pillar, at the highest tested strain rates. The simulations predicted a significant temperature rise of up to 200 K in nanocrystalline Ni at the grain boundaries, and 20 K in single crystalline Ni due to strain localization. Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction analysis of nanocrystalline nickel pillar post compression at 10^3 s-1 did not show any grain growth.</p>

            <p>The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.</p>

            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</p>

            <p>We consider unconventional magnets with proximity-induced superconductivity and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets under the influence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity induced by proximity effect. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as with $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave symmetries. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.</p>

The superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ first gets slightly enhanced and reaches a maximum $\sim$8.7 K at $\sim$8.5 GPa. With further applied pressure, $T_c$ is initially gradually suppressed, then more rapidly suppressed, followed by gradual suppression, revealing a superconducting dome. Two possible pressure-induced structural phase transitions are also observed at room temperature, from original hexagonal phase to another hexagonal structure above $\sim$11.5 GPa, and further to a structure with lower symmetry above $\sim$23.5 GPa.

            <p>We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.</p>

The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600°C to 800°C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</p>

For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems.

            <p>We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation Bounds for the Restricted Solid-on-Solid Model of Surface Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Sudijono</p>
            <p>The restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model is a model of continuous-time surface growth characterized by the constraint that adjacent height differences are bounded by a fixed constant. Though the model is conjectured to belong to the KPZ universality class, mathematical progress on the model is very sparse. We study basic properties of the model and establish bounds on surface height fluctuations as a function of time. A linear fluctuation bound is proven for all dimensions, and a logarithmic fluctuation lower bound is given for dimension one. The proofs rely on a new characterization of RSOS as a type of first passage percolation on a disordered lattice, which is of independent interest. The logarithmic lower bound is established by showing equality in distribution to the minimum of a certain dual RSOS process.</p>

            <h2>Emergent quantum phase transition of a Josephson junction coupled to a high-impedance multimode resonator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti</p>
            <p>The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate, strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state, but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of the phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Azodi, Herschel A Rabitz</p>
            <p>A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the \textit{patterns}, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order Rényi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Propagation in Integrable Heisenberg Chains from a New Lens</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Azodi, Herschel A Rabitz</p>
            <p>The exact single-magnon entanglement evolution in Heisenberg chains is obtained using the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) formulation. A dual, i.e., frequency and time-domain, analysis shows that the transient dynamics of individual spins' entanglement is described via a Bessel function of the first kind. Through QCTF, we bypass the evaluation of the full system's state for the purpose of obtaining entanglement. Although it is known that the observable entanglement edge is formed by the arrival of a stream of quasi-particles that travel with the maximum group velocity, we show how the early quasi-particles travel faster than the maximum group velocity of the chain and contribute to entanglement production. Our results can be extended to the multi-magnon regime, therefore opening up the means to better interpret equilibration dynamics and thermodynamics in Heisenberg chains.</p>

Under the relaxation time approximation, we obtain an iterative solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation in generic stationary spacetime. This solution provides a scheme to study non-equilibrium system order by order. Our calculations are performed in generic hydrodynamic frame, and the results can be reduced to a specific hydrodynamic frame by imposing constraints. As a specific example, we analytically calculated the covariant expressions of the particle flow and the energy momentum tensor up to the first order in relaxation time. Finally and most importantly, we present all 14 kinetic coefficients for a neutral system, which are verified to satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relation in a generic hydrodynamic frame and guarantee a non-negative entropy production in the frame where the first order conservation laws are restored.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Aurell, Lucas Hackl, Paweł Horodecki, Robert H. Jonsson, Mario Kieburg</p>
            <p>A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis. Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum speed limit for Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Silva Pratapsi, Sebastian Deffner, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables. Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to non-classicality at maximum speed. Our analysis also hints at boosted power extraction in genuinely non-classical dynamics.</p>

The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</p>

We construct and implement many-body computational order parameters for graph states using non-local measurement-based logic operations in the Clifford group. The order parameters measure the efficacy of entanglement to allow MBQC on graph states of any size. We parameterize finite-size scaling of these order parameters.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Jiang, Siyuan Zhang, Weiwei Zhu, Y. X. Zhao, Haoran Xue</p>
            <p>Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishik Perugu, Arijit Haldar, Sumilan Banerjee</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We support our large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamical behavior of quasiparticles is essential for uncovering novel quantum many-body phenomena. Among these phenomena, the polaron in ultracold atomic gases has attracted considerable interest due to its precise controllability. By engineering the underlying Hamiltonian, polarons serve as a versatile platform for studying both equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we investigate the quantum dynamics of strongly driven Bose polarons, where minority atoms are described as mobile impurities with spin-1/2, and majority atoms are bosons. The spin-$\uparrow$ impurity interacts with majority atoms through a tunable scattering length $a$, while the spin-$\downarrow$ impurity remains non-interacting. After turning on the Rabi coupling, we calculate the evolution of the total magnetization using a trial wavefunction. We identify the exhibition of anomalous Rabi oscillation and steady-state magnetization for $a>0$, due to the interplay between attractive and repulsive polarons. Our results provide a concrete example that illustrates how Rabi oscillations are dressed by system-environment coupling.</p>

            <p>The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</p>
            <p>The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</p>

            <p>Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{ö}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</p>

            <h2>Surface charge density wave in UTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo García Talavera, Miguel Águeda Velasco, Makoto Shimizu, Beilun Wu, Georg Knebel, Midori Amano Patino, Gerard Lapertot, Jacques Flouquet, Jean Pascal Brison, Dai Aoki, Youichi Yanase, Edwin Herrera, Isabel Guillamón, Hermann Suderow</p>
            <p>The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</p>

            <h2>Observation of the Axion quasiparticle in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</h2>

            <p>In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.</p>

            <h2>Boundary criticality in two-dimensional interacting topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Ge, Hong Yao, Shao-Kai Jian</p>
            <p>We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>Current-driven dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wooyon Kim, Jun Seok Seo, Se Kwon Kim</p>
            <p>Domain-wall skyrmions are magnetic solitons embedded in a domain wall that are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. Here, we theoretically study antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions and their current-driven motion within the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and verify our findings with micromagnetic simulations. While the skyrmion Hall effect is expected to be suppressed in the current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions, we observe a finite Hall angle, which originates from the anisotropic spin configuration of domain-wall skyrmions. The skyrmion Hall effect is, however, conditionally suppressed and the motion aligns with the current applied in certain directions, which can be interpreted as principal axes of a domain-wall skyrmion that is easily identified from the symmetry of the spin configuration. Our work on antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions shows that the dynamics of spin textures endowed with multiple soliton characteristics can be unconventional, which is envisaged to enrich the field of topological solitons.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear spin dynamics across Néel phase transition in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Busel, D. Polishchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski</p>
            <p>We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the Néel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the Néel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the Néel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the Néel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.</p>

            <h2>Photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the cubic Kondo-lattice model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Hamano, Masahito Mochizuki</p>
            <p>We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their dynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is demonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions from the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven system. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of pseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of electrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated from the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly occupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations, e.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient state of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the photodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type antiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening of the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the light polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the understanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the three-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnetism-Enhanced Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling in Infinite-Layer Nickelate</h2>

            <p>Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a promising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying high-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the nickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an exemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the non-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using advanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free parameters. The weak EPC strength $\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be greatly enhanced ($\sim$4$\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the $C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the flat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency phonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon softening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure around 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our predictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments and interply EPC in the nickelate.</p>

            <h2>Many-body cages: disorder-free glassiness from flat bands in Fock space, and many-body Rabi oscillations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Ben-Ami, Markus Heyl, Roderich Moessner</p>
            <p>We identify the many-body counterpart of flat bands, which we call many-body caging, as a general mechanism for non-equilibrium phenomena such as a novel type of glassy eigenspectrum order and many-body Rabi oscillations in the time domain. We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible this http URL general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Topologically enabled superconductivity: possible implications for rhombohedral graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Paoletti, Daniele Guerci, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Urban F.P. Seifert, Elio J. König</p>
            <p>We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.</p>
