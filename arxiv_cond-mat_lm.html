            <h2>Unveiling the amorphous ice layer during premelting using AFM integrating machine learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binze Tang, Chon-Hei Lo, Tiancheng Liang, Jiani Hong, Mian Qin, Yizhi Song, Duanyun Cao, Ying Jiang, Limei Xu</p>
            <p>Premelting plays a key role across physics, chemistry, materials and biology sciences but remains poorly understood at the atomic level due to surface characterization limitations. We report the discovery of a novel amorphous ice layer (AIL) preceding the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) during ice premelting, enabled by a machine learning framework integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics simulations. This approach overcomes AFM's depth and signal limitations, allowing for three-dimensional surface structure reconstruction from AFM images. It further enables structural exploration of premelting interfaces across a wide temperature range that are experimentally inaccessible. We identify the AIL, present between 121-180K, displaying disordered two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network with solid-like dynamics. Our findings refine the ice premelting phase diagram and offering new insights into the surface growth dynamic, dissolution and interfacial chemical reactivity. Methodologically, this work establishes a novel framework for AFM-based 3D structural discovery, marking a significant leap in our ability to probe complex disordered interfaces with unprecedented precision and paving the way for future disciplinary research, including surface reconstruction, crystallization, ion solvation, and biomolecular recognition.</p>

            <h2>Localization from Infinitesimal Kinetic Grading: Critical Scaling and Kibble-Zurek Universality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Argha Debnath, Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional lattice model with site-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes that follow a power-law profile. The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $\alpha$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|\alpha| \to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles.</p>

            <h2>Time-resolved Charge Detection in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Niese, Michele Masseroni, Clara Scherm, Christoph Adam, Max J. Ruckriegel, Artem O. Denisov, Jonas D. Gerber, Lara Ostertag, Jessica Richter, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin</p>
            <p>We investigate electronic transport through gate-defined quantum dots in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ using an integrated charge detector. We observe a crossover from two weakly coupled single dots to a strongly coupled double quantum dot. In the regime of extremely weak dot-lead coupling, where the direct transport current is below the detection limit, we measure the dot occupation via charge detection and access the few-electron regime. Due to the large band gap of MoS$_2$, tunneling rates can be sufficiently suppressed to resolve individual tunneling events. These results establish a platform for single-shot spin- and valley-to-charge conversion and highlight the potential of transition-metal dichalcogenide quantum dots for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Zimmerman, Daniel Podolsky, Ronen Rapaport, Snir Gazit</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</p>

            <h2>Anyon Dispersion in Aharonov-Casher Bands and Implications for Twisted MoTe${}_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Yan, Qingchen Li, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Campbell McLauchlan, Vedant Motamarri, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Anyon Statistics from Neural Network Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andres Perez Fadon, David Pfau, James S. Spencer, Wan Tong Lou, Titus Neupert, W. M. C. Foulkes</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states host emergent anyons with exotic exchange statistics, but obtaining direct access to their topological properties in real systems remains a challenge. Neural-network wavefunctions provide a flexible computational approach, as they can represent highly correlated states without requiring a tailored basis. Here we use the neural-network variational Monte Carlo method to study the fractional quantum Hall effect on the torus and find the three degenerate ground states at filling factor nu=1/3. From these, we extract the modular S matrix via entanglement interferometry, a technique previously only applied to lattice models. The resulting S matrix encodes the quantum dimensions, fusion rules, and exchange statistics of the emergent anyons, providing a direct numerical demonstration of the topological order. The calculated anyon properties match the well-known theoretical and experimental results. Our work establishes neural-network wavefunctions as a powerful new tool for investigating anyonic properties.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory for edge current and noise in 2D topological superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Pintus, A. Crépieux</p>
            <p>We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.</p>

            <h2>Recent progress in quantum spin liquids, fractional magnetization plateaus, and unconventional superconductivity in kagome lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Wei He, Shun-Li Yu, Jian-Xin Li</p>
            <p>The kagome lattice, with its unique geometric structure, has emerged as a leading platform for exploring quantum many-body physics, particularly in the study of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) and unconventional superconductivity. This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities. Finally, we review recent experimental advances in unconventional superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), with a particular focus on chiral superconductivity and pairing density waves.</p>

            <h2>Power-Law Suppression of Phonon Thermal Transport by Magnetic Excitations in a Molecular Quantum Spin Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Fujiyama, K. Ueda, Y. Otsuka</p>
            <p>We present large-scale ab initio phonon calculations for the molecular quantum spin liquid X[Pd(dmit)2]2. An unusually low average phonon velocity ( 700 {m/s}) and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1} confine the Debye T^{3} regime to T < 2 K. As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Holistic Design of Catalysts Tailored for Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Qian, Yue Li, Ying Xie, Jian Zhang, Pai Li, Yue Yu, Zhe Liu, Feng Ding, Jin Zhang</p>
            <p>Catalyst design is crucial for materials synthesis, especially for complex reaction networks. Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Strain Modulated Correlated Plasmons in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Their Role in High-temperature Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiongfang Liu, Shengwei Zeng, Xun Liu, Kun Han, Difan Zhou, Chi Sin Tang, Ping Yang, Mark B. H. Breese, Chuanbing Cai, Ariando Ariando, Mi Jiang, Xinmao Yin</p>
            <p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Xing Ding, Wen-Tong Li, Li-Min Zhang, Yu-Biao Wu, Duanlu Zhou, Lin Zhuang, Wu-Ming Liu</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases</p>

            <h2>Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Contant, Maria Hellgren</p>
            <p>We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</p>

            <h2>Hyperfine coupling in singlet ground state magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Thalmeier</p>
            <p>The influence of hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins and of their quadrupolar splitting on the induced moment order in singlet ground state magnets is investigated. The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified.</p>

            <h2>Predictive Inorganic Synthesis based on Machine Learning using Small Data sets: a case study of size-controlled Cu Nanoparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brent Motmans, Digvijay Ghogare, Thijs G.I. van Wijk, An Hardy, Danny E.P. Vanpoucke</p>
            <p>Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction. This approach provides a sustainable and experimentally realistic pathway toward data-driven inorganic synthesis design.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopy of Wigner crystal polarons in an atomically thin semiconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Wang, F. Menzel, F. Pichler, P. Knüppel, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, M. Knap, T. Smoleński</p>
            <p>Strongly interacting electrons in two-dimensional systems can spontaneously break translational symmetry, forming a periodic Wigner crystal. Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically. Our work establishes layered materials as a unique platform for exploring dynamical impurity dressing by strongly correlated electronic orders.</p>

            <p>We report the transverse control of spin-wave propagation in the configuration where the spin-wave wavevector k is perpendicular to the charge-current density J. Building on theoretical predictions of spin-wave refraction by nonuniform spin-polarized currents, and guided by micromagnetic simulations used to optimize the device geometry and current distribution, we experimentally explore a Y-shaped Permalloy structure in which a locally injected current perturbs the spin-wave dispersion. Measurements reveal current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches, providing initial experimental indications consistent with transverse, spin-transfer-torque-driven deflection. Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of influencing spin-wave routing through local current injection and establish a proof-of-concept basis for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation in reconfigurable magnonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>High-Temperature Activation of Single-Photon Emitters in monolayer WS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gyeongjun Lee, Antoine Borel, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Fausto Sirotti, Fabian Cadiz</p>
            <p>Controlled activation of defect-bound excitonic states in two-dimensional semiconductors provides a route to isolated quantum emitters and a sensitive probe of defect physics. Here we demonstrate that \textit{in situ} high-temperature annealing of hBN-encapsulated monolayer WS$_2$ on a suspended microheater leads to the emergence of spectrally isolated single-photon emitters at cryogenic temperatures. Annealing at temperatures around 1100 K produces a sharp emission line, $X_L$, red-shifted by approximately 80 meV from the neutral exciton and exhibiting a linewidth below 200 $\mu$eV. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy and power-dependent measurements show that $X_L$ originates from annealing-induced defects in the WS$_2$ monolayer, while second-order photon correlation measurements reveal clear antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0)<0.5$. These results establish high-temperature \textit{in situ} annealing as a controlled means to access defect-bound excitonic states and single-photon emission in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>This paper reviews recent advances in the field of metallic glasses, focusing on the development of novel experimental techniques and in silico models. We discuss progress in experimental characterization, additive manufacturing, multiscale modeling approaches, and the growing role of machine learning in understanding and designing these complex materials. On the experimental side, we highlight measurements of thermophysical properties of supercooled liquids via fast chip calorimetry and enhancements in mechanical properties through rejuvenation treatments. This work underscores the crucial role of short-range order and medium-range order in controlling metallic glass mechanical properties. Recent progress in structural probes allows in situ observations of deformation mechanisms, positioning the field well to further advance our understanding of mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing of metallic glasses is discussed as one encouraging new manufacturing route for metallic glasses. We examine laser powder-bed fusion process physics and the central trade-off between amorphicity and densification, including heat affected zone devitrification and defects formation, together with emerging mitigation strategies and applications. On the theoretical and simulation side, we review advances in nanoscale, mesoscale, and continuum modeling of metallic glasses that have led to promising approaches by which multiscale schemes can incorporate data sourced from atomic-scale simulations. These efforts have helped to elucidate the connection between the glass structure and mechanical and rheological responses. We also cover the development of machine learning interatomic potentials for metallic glasses, along with machine learning driven prediction of glass forming ability and inverse design methods. Finally, challenges and directions for future research are presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between spin currents and spin waves in nanofabricated Permalloy waveguides with geometrical constrictions. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Wigner polarons reveal Wigner crystal dynamics in a monolayer semiconductor</h2>

            <p>Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.</p>

            <h2>Observation of REBCO delamination in the resistive insulation nested coils</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Lu, Iain Dixon, Kwangmin Kim, Yan Xin, Hongyu Bai</p>
            <p>The REBCO coated conductor has the potential to be widely used in ultrahigh field magnets. It is well known, however, that it is not mechanically strong against delamination in the direction normal to its surface due to its intrinsic layered structure. Therefore, conductor delamination is one of the major design challenges for REBCO magnet coils. As a part of the development of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL), a dry-wound resistive-insulation-nested-coils (RINC) was designed to reach 25.8 T. It used surface-treated stainless-steel tape as a co-wind to control the turn-to-turn contact resistance, and was fabricated and tested in a liquid helium bath. During the test, two of the double pancake modules exhibited resistive transitions at a current significantly lower than the designed value. The postmortem inspection of the REBCO conductor of these modules by reel-to-reel magnetization at 77 K found sections of very low critical current. Further investigations of one section by chemical etching, visual inspection, and electron microscopy revealed that conductor of this section was delaminated. We present the detailed findings of these postmortem characterizations. The implication of this type of delamination for future magnet designs will be discussed.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a platform for realizing Wigner crystals and enable their detection via exciton spectroscopy. We develop a microscopic theoretical model for excitons interacting with the localized electrons of the Wigner crystal, including their vibrational motion. In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin J. Dringoli, Zhongzhen Luo, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, David G. Cooke</p>
            <p>Time-resolved multi-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is used to observe pump fluence-dependent dynamics in the optical conductivity of photoexcited tin selenide (SnSe) over an ultrabroadband spectral range of 0.5 - 11 THz at fluences from 0.1 - 7.5 mJ/cm$^2$. At pump fluences below 3 mJ/cm$^2$, we observe a free carrier Drude spectrum and broad phonon resonances typical of a photoexcited semiconductor. With increasing fluence, a suppression of the DC photoconductivity is observed, indicating an interruption of long range transport due to phase disorder. Concomitantly, the c-axis polarized $B^2_{1u}$ optical phonon narrows and blueshifts, consistent with a transition to a higher symmetry structure. At intermediate fluences of 3.1 mJ/cm$^2$, a high frequency Lorentzian component appears that red shifts on a 50 ps time scale, where a Drude spectrum is eventually restored. Our results provide evidence for a non-thermal, photo-induced nucleation of higher symmetry, semi-metallic phase domains in SnSe appearing within 200 fs with the system relaxing back to its homogeneous $Pnma$ semiconducting phase on a 200 ps time scale.</p>

            <p>Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</p>

After controlled partial D desorption of TbFe$_{2}$D$_{4.2}$ , the XRD patterns of several TbFe$_{2}$D$_{x}$ deuterides were measured ex-situ using synchrotron radiation at room temperature, revealing the formation of different phases with cubic or monoclinic structures separated by two phase ranges.A tetragonal superstructure was observed for a phase with $x$ = 2. This work can explain previous results of the literature indicating the existence of cubic and, or rhombohedral hydrides depending on the hydrogenation conditions and the H content.

            <h2>How accurate are foundational machine learning interatomic potentials for heterogeneous catalysis?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luuk H. E. Kempen, Raffaele Cheula, Mie Andersen</p>
            <p>Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are being developed at a rapid pace, promising closer and closer approximation to ab initio accuracy. This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.</p>

            <h2>Exfoliation and Cleavage of Crystals from a Universal Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Barnowsky, Carsten Timm, Rico Friedrich</p>
            <p>Exfoliation and cleavage create two-dimensional (2D) materials and surfaces with physical and chemical properties distinct from their bulk parents. The rising class of non-van der Waals (non-vdW) 2D materials derived from non-layered crystals provides a fascinating new platform - greatly expanding the landscape of low-dimensional materials. Current computational models, however, provide limited guidance: existing descriptors are largely tailored to vdW layered systems. Here, we introduce a general framework predicting crystal cleavage and exfoliable 2D subunits directly from bulk structures. At its core is a universal eXfoliation and Cleavage Potential (XCP) enabling large-scale screening of diverse materials at negligible computational cost. Applying this approach, we obtain 37,208 cleavable surfaces and candidate non-vdW 2D materials from which we investigate 2,377 likely exfoliable ones using high-throughput density functional theory. We identify sheets with square and rectangular lattices, semiconducting systems exhibiting an indirect-to-direct band-gap transition upon exfoliation, and first non-vdW 2D metals. Our study thus opens a systematic route to explore and design new 2D materials with unprecedented chemical and structural diversity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammadreza Fakhraei, Michaela Bush, Chris A. Kieslich, Michael P. Howard</p>
            <p>The dynamics of anisotropic particles are dictated by forces and torques that can be challenging to mathematically represent in computer simulations. Several data-driven approaches have been developed to approximate these interactions, but they often rely on having large amounts of training data that may be practically difficult to generate. Here, we extend a framework we recently developed for approximating anisotropic pair potentials to the approximation of pairwise forces and torques. The framework uses multivariate polynomials and physics-motivated coordinate transformations to produce accurate approximations using limited amounts of data. We first derive expressions relating the force and torque to partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the transformed coordinates used to represent the particle configuration. We then explore several options for approximating the forces and torques, and we critically assess their accuracy using model two- and three-dimensional shape-anisotropic nanoparticles as test cases. We find that interpolation of the pairwise potential energy produces the best result when it is known, but force and torque matching (regression) is a viable strategy when only the force and torque is available.</p>

            <h2>Reduction of interaction order in hard combinatorial optimization via conditionally independent degrees of freedom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandru Ciobanu, David Dahmen, John Paul Strachan, Moritz Helias</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems have a broad range of applications and map to physical systems with complex dynamics. Among them, the 3-SAT problem is prominent due to its NP-complete nature. In physics terms, its solution corresponds to finding the ground state of a disordered Ising spin Hamiltonian with third-order, or tensor, interactions. The large growth of the number of third-order interactions with number of variables poses technical difficulties for the physical implementation of minimizers. Therefore, researchers have proposed quadratization techniques which reduce the order of the system, however, at the cost of including additional degrees of freedom. Their inclusion induces a drastic slow down in the minimization, which makes such procedures technically infeasible for large problems. In this work, we take a physics approach by employing the renormalization group to create a pairwise interacting system from the original third-order system while preserving the free energy. Our procedure utilizes additional degrees of freedom that exhibit an independent dynamics provided the original degrees of freedom are fixed. A step-wise trace of the extra variables while running the minimization is therefore theoretically manageable, yielding a state-dependent effective interaction. We use the effective interaction to reconstruct the original third-order energy spectrum, as this yields equal scaling of computations-to-ground-state compared to the original tensor formulation. Here, the original degrees of freedom interact with a subsystem that appears to be in a superposition of an exponentially large number of states. In the zero-temperature limit, the superposition concentrates on one state. Our spectrum-engineering techniques reveal new routes toward the ground state of disordered Ising systems, through Markov chains, and allow for efficient technological implementations.</p>

            <p>MXenes are promising candidates for electrochemical applications due to their high conductivity, tunable surface chemistry, and catalytic potential. However, their use in bulk electrode form remains unexplored despite advantages such as higher current density and improved mechanical integrity. Herein, we present a methodology for the fabrication of self-supported vdW solid Ti3C2Tz MXene electrodes, produced by cold compaction followed by vacuum heat treatment at 600 °C, which effectively removes interlayer confined water and stabilizes the bulk 3D structure. The resulting binder-free electrodes exhibit enhanced mechanical robustness along with structural and chemical stability in various electrolytes. The MXene electrodes demonstrate adequate HER activity while maintaining electrochemical stability over time, with minimal oxidation or changes in termination surface chemistry. This approach is scalable and cost-effective, overcoming limitations of nanoscale MXene architectures in electrochemical environments and offering a practical pathway toward MXene-based materials for sustainable hydrogen energy technologies.</p>

            <p>Conjugated organic molecules play a central role in a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells. A major bottleneck in the computational design of these materials is the discrepancy between simulation and experimental time and length scales. Coarse-graining (CG) offers a promising solution to bridge this gap by reducing redundant degrees of freedom and smoothing the potential energy landscape, thereby significantly accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. However, standard CG models are typically parameterized from homogeneous bulk simulations and assume density-independent effective interactions. As a consequence, they often fail to replicate inhomogeneous systems, such as (free-standing) thin films, due to an incorrect representation of liquid-vacuum interfacial properties. In this work, we develop a CG parametrization strategy that incorporates local-density-dependent potentials to capture material heterogeneities. We evaluate the methodology by simulating free-standing films and comparing interfacial orientational order parameters between all-atom and CG simulations. The resulting CG models accurately reproduce bulk densities and radial distribution functions as well as molecular orientations at the liquid-vacuum interface. This work paves the way for reliable, computation-driven predictions of atomically resolved interfacial ordering in organic molecular systems.</p>

            <p>We present a spin-dependent extension of the non-orthogonal generalized Wannier function (NGWF) formalism within the framework of linear-scaling density functional theory (LS-DFT) as implemented in the ONETEP code. In traditional LS-DFT representations, both spin channels are constrained to share a common variational basis, which limits the accuracy for systems that are spin-polarized or exhibit magnetic order. Our approach allows NGWFs to vary independently for each spin channel, enabling a more accurate representation of spin-polarization in the electronic density. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through a series of test cases, including localized magnetic defects in two-dimensional hBN, transition metal complexes, two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials, and both bulk and nanocluster ferromagnetic Co. In each scenario, the incorporation of spin-dependent NGWFs results in enhanced accuracy for total energy calculations, improved localization of spin density, and accurate predictions of magnetic ground states. This improvement is particularly notable when combined with DFT+U and DFT+U+J corrections. In this work, we take the opportunity to describe the combination of DFT+U+J and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism within the LS-DFT framework, including how PAW participates in the ionic Pulay force, and in the minimum-tracking linear response approach for computing parameters in situ. Our findings demonstrate that spin-dependent NGWFs are a crucial and computationally efficient advancement in the linear-scaling DFT simulation of spin-polarized materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Tang, Guan-Hua Huang, Eugene Zaremba, Shizhong Zhang, Zhigang Wu</p>
            <p>The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Mandal, Mihir Ranjan Sahoo, Kalpataru Pradhan</p>
            <p>Epitaxial strain provides a powerful, non-chemical route to tune the properties of functional materials by manipulating the coupling between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials.</p>

Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase.

            <p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p>

Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamical study of N$_2$ clathrate hydrate from DFT calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Martin-Gondre, V. Meko Fotso, C. Métais, A. Patt, J. Ollivier, A. Desmedt</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic stability of N$_2$ clathrate hydrates in the sI and sII structures is investigated using density functional theory with several exchange-correlation functionals, explicitly accounting for composition (cage occupancies) and pressure at T = 0 K. Among the tested functionals, revPBE-D3(0) best reproduces experimental lattice parameters and bulk moduli B$_0$ . Energetic analyses confirm the strong impact of large cage double occupancy on sI, whereas the convex-hull results show that sI with single occupancy remains thermodynamically stable up to $\sim$ 0.8 GPa alongside sII with single occupancy. Increasing pressure then stabilizes sII with double occupancy, consistent with its larger large-cage volume and lower framework strain. These results provide a coherent, first-principles thermodynamic framework for N$_2$ hydrate stability and a baseline for finite-temperature extension.</p>

            <h2>Nonunitary spin-triplet superconductors in Zeeman magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Li, Vahid Hassanzade, Maxim Dzero, Vladyslav Kozii</p>
            <p>We study spin-triplet superconductivity with both unitary and nonunitary pairing in the presence of an external Zeeman magnetic field. Within a mean-field framework, we exactly diagonalize the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and derive general expressions for the quasiparticle spectrum, superconducting gap, critical temperature, and spin magnetization, valid for arbitrary magnetic-field strengths and temperatures. We analyze in detail the nonlinear spin susceptibility and the field evolution of the superconducting gap and transition temperature, highlighting qualitative differences between unitary and nonunitary pairing states. Our results are broadly applicable to a wide range of materials, including systems with both weak and strong spin-orbit coupling. We show that systematic measurements of the critical temperature and spin susceptibility as functions of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field provide a powerful means to identify the structure of the spin-triplet order parameter, and we discuss implications of our findings for candidate materials such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of CoNb$_2$O$_6$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshito Watanabe, Simon Trebst, Ciarán Hickey</p>
            <p>With recent advances in terahertz (THz) sources and detection, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which allows to probe nonlinear responses in a two-frequency plane, now reaches the meV regime relevant for quasiparticle excitations in magnetic materials. This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets.</p>

            <h2>Optimal array geometries for kinetic magnetism and Nagaoka polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Hernandez-Cepeda, Sergio E. Ulloa</p>
            <p>Quantum dot (QD) platforms have enabled the direct observation of Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NFM) in small arrays and non-infinite interaction strength. However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\simeq \lambda_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $\lambda_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $\pi$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($\lambda_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system.</p>

            <h2>Revival Dynamics from Equilibrium States: Scars from Chords in SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarghya Chakraborty, Dario Rosa</p>
            <p>We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of real-space geometry, topology, and metric tensor in quantum transport in periodically corrugated spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Schwager, Theresa Appel, Jamal Berakdar</p>
            <p>The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.</p>

            <h2>Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Talbot</p>
            <p>We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.</p>

            <p>The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful probe of exotic excitations in correlated quantum materials, providing access to charge-neutral heat carriers that remain invisible to electrical transport. To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = \kappa_{xx,xy} / (T \sigma_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.</p>

            <p>Topological textures in magnetically ordered materials are important case studies for fundamental research with promising applications in data science. They can also serve as photonic elements to mold electromagnetic fields endowing them with features inherent to the spin order, as demonstrated analytically and numerically in this work. A self-consistent theory is developed for the interaction of spatially structured electromagnetic fields with non-collinear, topologically non-trivial spin textures. A tractable numerical method is designed and implemented for the calculation of the formed magnetic/photonic textures in the entire simulation space. Numerical illustrations are presented for scattering from point-like singularities, i.e. Bloch points, in the magnetization vector fields, evidencing that the geometry and topology of the magnetic order results in photonic fields that embody orbital angular momentum, chirality as well as magnetoelectric densities. Features of the scattered fields can serve as a fingerprint for the underlying magnetic texture and its dynamics. The findings point to the potential of topological magnetic textures as a route to molding photonic fields.</p>

            <h2>The Motile Josephson Array: Bridging Active Turbulence and Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus F Ivarsen</p>
            <p>Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support an emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for the emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity.</p>

            <p>With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton.</p>

            <p>The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments.</p>

The former is limited by fiber-optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza T. Batley, Sourav Saha</p>
            <p>Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.</p>

            <p>In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyuan Fang, Qicheng Tang, Xueda Wen</p>
            <p>Exploring universal entanglement structure in many-body systems is both fundamental and challenging, particularly when the system undergoes non-unitary operations. In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.</p>

In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.</p>

In this work, we revisit dimensional reduction, providing new arguments and reformulating existing proofs in terms of the cohomology of a supercharge $Q$. We obtain three main results. First, we show that the recently developed picture of dimensional reduction via decoupling of operators admits a natural explanation in terms of $Q$-exactness. Second, we provide a new proof of dimensional reduction using the supersymmetric localization argument. Third, we revisit Cardy's ``interpolation'' proof -- which is reminiscent of localization but does not rely on saddle-point methods -- and show that it can be understood as a consequence of deforming the action by a $Q$-exact term. Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry.</p>

We analyse the exact match between the two and identify the scheme independent quantities capturing nonlinearly realised symmetries. This leads to universal integral identities for correlation functions in the presence of tilts and displacements. We present several applications of them. We also study possible anomalies, recovering known ones, finding new expressions for them, and uncovering new ones.</p>

We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner.</p>

            <p>The inhomogeneous distribution of P1 centers in type 1b HPHT diamond samples allows multiple DNP mechanisms to occur within the same crystal, resulting in complex DNP spectra. At some crystal orientations, different DNP mechanisms can compete to drive hyperpolarization with different signs at the same applied microwave frequency. We perform microwave-irradiated DNP using both monochromatic and frequency-modulated microwave excitation to explore the competition between these DNP mechanisms in diamond at room temperature. We demonstrate that frequency-modulated DNP is a tool for suppressing certain DNP mechanisms while enhancing others in a single-crystal diamond sample. Frequency modulation also enables higher enhancement of the NMR signal beyond traditional monochromatic DNP under some conditions. In a powder sample, competing enhancement mechanisms can also arise from different crystallite orientations in the powder. We observe that at certain microwave frequencies the DNP signal changes sign during the polarization build-up, even with monochromatic microwave irradiation.

            <h2>Discrete time crystals enhanced by Stark potentials in Rydberg atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Jia Wang, Ling-Zhi Tang, Yan-Xiong Du, Dan-Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases in periodically driven systems that exhibit spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translation symmetry. The stabilization of most DTC phases is achieved via the disorder-induced many-body localization. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme to realize disorder-free DTCs in a periodically driven Rydberg atom array. Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudra Sekhri, Rahil N. Valani, Tapio Simula</p>
            <p>We experimentally investigate the dynamics of synthetic active particles composed of gravitationally bouncing, superwalking droplets confined within an annular fluid bath. Driven by a topologically pumping dual-frequency waveform, the droplets exhibit alternating active (walking) and dormant (bouncing) phases, producing intermittent azimuthal motion. Tracking individual droplets reveals pseudolaminar chaotic dynamics in the time series of particle's angular position, characterized by laminar plateaus that are interrupted by short irregular bursts of activity. Increasing the driving amplitude induces a qualitative change in the active particle's intermittent dynamics, arising from a symmetry-breaking transition in its Faraday-wave field environment: continuous SO(2)-symmetric "channelling" waves give way to discrete "trapping" patterns. These findings demonstrate how environmental symmetry and spatiotemporal structure modulate motility and intermittency in synthetic active matter.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Interfacial Energy and Morphology of DNA Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sihan Liu, Andrej Košmrlj</p>
            <p>The physics and morphology of biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation underpin diverse biological processes, exemplified by the nested organization of nucleoli that facilitates ribosome biogenesis. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $\gamma_{i\in\{1,2\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $\gamma_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $\gamma_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narumi Fujii, Keisuke Taga, Riccardo Muolo, Bob Rink, Hiroya Nakao</p>
            <p>Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Lee, Panayotis G. Kevrekidis, Wenrui Hao</p>
            <p>In this work, we are motivated by a recent variant of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation describing cold, dilute atomic condensates with quantum fluctuation effects. Our goal is to develop robust numerical methods capable of uncovering diverse stationary solutions in such NLS models. Specifically, and in line with recent theoretical and experimental interest, we focus on ultracold quantum droplets in Bose mixtures influenced by the Lee Huang Yang quantum fluctuation correction and study these systems in one and two dimensional settings. To this end, we deploy several numerical techniques. The homotopy grid method allows systematic refinement from coarse to fine spatial discretizations in one dimension, while the dimension by dimension homotopy approach extends one-dimensional solutions to two-dimensional domains. These methods effectively detect broad families of stationary states, many of which have not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, they enable the monitoring of solution continuation and bifurcation phenomena. During our investigation, we encounter unusual bifurcation events, including nonstandard pitchforks and saddle-center bifurcations, which exhibit novel stability transitions. For example, we identify continuous pathways connecting vortex and dark soliton stripe branches, absent in the standard cubic defocusing model. Overall, the presence of competing mean-field and quantum fluctuation interactions leads to a richer bifurcation structure than in traditional cubic NLS systems. These findings suggest that similar complex bifurcation and stability phenomena may appear in other settings, including higher-dimensional systems or models with competing nonlinearities such as cubic-quintic interactions, highlighting the importance of further theoretical and numerical exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathew Thomas Arun, Ritik Pal</p>
            <p>We develop a neural network framework to predict the five-dimensional background geometry, dilaton potential, and chiral symmetry breaking scalar potential of holographic QCD from unflavored meson mass spectra. The model was trained in a discretized form of the Schrödinger-like equation, which resembles a linear moose in ``deconstructed" 5 dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in contrast to the AdS/DL with ``emergent" space-time. Using the $\rho$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $f_0$ unflavored mesons and their excitations as training data, the model learns confining effective potentials and computes a dilaton profile that satisfies the null energy condition. The network predicts the IR behavior of dilaton to be in-between linear and quadratic forms. Moreover, the symmetry-breaking bulk potential of the scalar field, $V(X)= k_1 X^3+k_2 X^4$, was computed, and the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ predicted to be $\sim - \ 8$ and $\sim 17$ respectively. The deep-learned parameters, metric, and the dilaton profile were then used to predict the pion mass and its spectrum with good accuracy. A Python code, along with the trained models, is provided to facilitate further studies</p>

            <h2>Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Renormalization Group Flow Irreversibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Giataganas</p>
            <p>We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Replica Keldysh field theory of quantum-jump processes: General formalism and application to imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Kloiber-Tollinger, Lukas M. Sieberer</p>
            <p>Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.</p>

We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hat{\lambda}$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hat{\mu}_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hat{\lambda}\to0}\hat{\lambda}/\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.</p>

            <p>Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.</p>

            <h2>Scalable tests of quantum contextuality from stabilizer-testing nonlocal games</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanbing Zhao, H. W. Shawn Liew, Wen Wei Ho, Chunxiao Liu, Vir B. Bulchandani</p>
            <p>Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.</p>

            <p>Earth's relief is approximately self-affine, meaning a zoom-in on a small region looks statistically similar to a large region upon a suitable rescaling. Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.</p>

            <p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p>

We use it to construct stationary superflows close to the superfluid-normal phase boundary, and examine their stability. We obtain an exact expression for Landau's critical velocity and show that the standard Newtonian profiles (such as the near-vortex condensate depletion or the boundary-layer decay) persist unmodified in the relativistic setting. We further analyse a genuinely relativistic configuration in which an accelerated superfluid develops a phase boundary induced by Tolman temperature gradients.</p>

We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol.

            <p>Molecular crystals possess a highly complex crystallographic landscape which in many cases results in the experimental observation of multiple crystal structures for the same compound. Accurate results can often be obtained for such systems by employing periodic density functional theory using hybrid functionals; however, this is not always computationally feasible. One possibility to circumvent these expensive periodic calculations is the utilization of multimer embedding methods. Therein, the fully periodic crystal is described at a lower level of theory, and subsequently monomer energies, dimer interaction energies, etc. are corrected via high-level calculations. In this paper, we further extend such a multimer embedding approach by one multimer order for all investigated properties, allowing us to compute lattice energies up to the tetramer embedding level, and atomic forces, the stress tensor, and harmonic phonons up to the trimer level. We test the significance of including these higher-order multimers by embedding PBE0+MBD multimers into periodic PBE+MBD calculations utilizing the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals and comparing the results to explicit periodic PBE0+MBD calculations. We show that tetramer interactions systematically improve the lattice energy approximation and explore multiple possibilities for multimer selection. Furthermore, we confirm that trimer interactions are crucial for the description of the stress tensor, yielding cell volumes within 1 % of those of PBE0+MBD. Subsequently, this also results in an improvement of the description of vibrational properties, giving on average gamma point frequencies within 1.3 wave numbers and vibrational free energies within 0.3 kJ/mol of the PBE0+MBD results.</p>

            <p>Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.</p>

            <p>Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.</p>

We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</p>

            <p>We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</p>

            <h2>Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Onari, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Hall effect from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Yurong Yang, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a topology-related transport phenomenon being of potential interest in spintronics, because this effect enables the efficient probe of magnetic orders (i.e., data readout in memory devices). It is well known that AHE spontaneously occurs in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with magnetization. While recent studies reveal electric-field induced AHE (via linear magnetoelectric coupling), an AHE originating from {\it nonlinear} magnetoelectric coupling remains largely unexplored. Here, by symmetry analysis, we establish the phenomenological theory regarding the spontaneous and electric-field driven AHE in magnets. We show that a large variety of magnetic point groups host an AHE that is driven by uni-axial, bi-axial, or tri-axial electric field and that comes from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling. Such electric-field driven anomalous Hall conductivities are reversible by reversing the magnetic orders. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations suggest Cr$_2$O$_3$ and CoF$_2$ as candidates hosting the aforementioned AHE. Our work emphasizes the important role of nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in creating exotic transport phenomena, and offers alternative avenues for the probe of magnetic orders.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.</p>

            <h2>Multichannel active-space embedding of atomic multiplets in plane-wave DFT/PAW for core-level spectroscopies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Mirone, Mauro Rovezzi, Christoph Sahle, Alessandro Longo</p>
            <p>We introduce an active-space embedding framework for core-level spectroscopies that connects localized atomic multiplets to continuum resonances within a plane-wave DFT/PAW description. The approach is complementary to widely used core-level Bethe--Salpeter implementations based on a two-particle (core-exciton) picture with typically static screening: here a correlated multiplet manifold of the absorber (including the core hole and open-shell configurations) is coherently coupled to a plane-wave photoelectron, enabling a unified treatment of localized multiplet structure and continuum lineshapes. Spectra are computed in a general time-domain formulation equivalent to Fermi's golden rule: a transition operator tailored to the specific spectroscopy technique is applied to the correlated ground state to generate an excited wavepacket, and the corresponding wavepacket autocorrelation function is evaluated without explicit real-time propagation, using Lanczos tridiagonalization or the kernel polynomial method; the spectral intensity follows from its Fourier representation. We validate the method at the Ce \(N_{4,5}\) edges, reproducing in quantitative agreement with experiment both high-\(Q\) multiplet features and the low-\(Q\) giant dipole resonance continuum, including a characteristic low-energy shoulder relevant for robust Ce valence assignments. The implementation is available open-source within the Quantum ESPRESSO XSPECTRA package (xspectruplet mode), together with reproducible inputs and scripts.</p>

            <h2>Electrically switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings in collinear antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that FeOOH and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a family of novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foams that, upon deformation, lead to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in their surroundings.

The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different particle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.</p>

            <p>PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Trushin</p>
            <p>Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Electrically generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging because it requires compensating for momentum mismatch, a process conventionally achieved through inelastic electron transport in nanostructures. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that electrical SPP generation is possible by directly coupling electron-hole dipoles to the quantized SPP field across an insulating spacer without accompanying electron transport. This approach can be realized in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of strongly-biased monolayer graphene as the emitter, few-layer hexagonal boron nitride as the spacer, and silver (or gold) as the plasmonic material. In this configuration, graphene's remarkable ability to support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population results in non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission that is uniform along the hBN/Ag interface, achieving a power conversion efficiency of up to 1% and a Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</p>

            <h2>Number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Dolgushev, Olivier Bénichou</p>
            <p>The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive a complete asymptotic characterization of the fluctuations of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. We show that the fluctuations of $m_N$ exhibit a sharp transition at the Hurst exponent $H=3/4$: for $H\le 3/4$ they satisfy a central limit theorem with Gaussian limiting law, whereas for $H>3/4$ they converge to a non-Gaussian Rosenblatt process. The convergence at the process level gives us full statistical description at all times. We exemplify it on the covariance of the rescaled minima process, which displays two qualitatively distinct regimes matching Brownian and Rosenblatt covariances on either side of this threshold. Our analysis relies on a Hermite/Wick decomposition of the local-minimum indicator, which isolates a quadratic functional of an effective long-memory mode as the unique driver of the anomalous statistics. These results identify the count of local minima as a simple and robust diagnostic of long-range dependence in non-Markovian Gaussian processes, a conclusion supported by numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Kondo effect under arbitrary spin-momentum locking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kinari Goto, Yusuke Nishida</p>
            <p>The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.</p>

            <h2>Zeeman-type spin splittings in strained d-wave altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yahui Zhai, Longju Yu, Jian Lv, Wei Zhang, Hong Jian Zhao</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnetic materials have become rather attractive because such materials showcase combined advantages of ferromagnets (e.g., spin current) and antiferromagnets (e.g., low stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics). Symmetry arguments imply that $d$-wave altermagnets may host strain-induced nonrelativistic Zeeman-type spin splittings (ZSSs), and a theoretical, numerical, and experimental justification of such phenomena are of high necessity. In the present work, we work with collinear spin point groups (SPGs) and use symmetry analysis to identify 15 SPGs that host strain-induced nonrelativistic ZSSs. These 15 SPGs coincide with the cases associated with $d$-wave alternating spin splittings reported in literature. We further corroborate our analysis by first-principles numerical simulations, which indicate that a shear strain of $2\%$ creates sizable nonrelativistic ZSSs of up to 177, 100, and 102 meV in CoF$_2$, LiFe$_2$F$_6$ and La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$ $d$-wave altermagnetic semiconductors, respectively. Our work suggests an alternative route toward creating spin current in altermagnets, which may be used to design altermagnetic-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Seyedi, Alex Albaugh</p>
            <p>Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs) are a novel class of polymer structures in which the components are connected by mechanical bonds instead of covalent bonds. We measure the single-molecule rheological properties of polyrotaxanes, daisy chains, and polycatenanes under steady shear and steady uniaxial extension using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions. We obtain key rheological features, including tumbling dynamics, molecular extension, stress, and viscosity. By systematically varying structural features, we demonstrate how MIP topology governs flow response. Compared to linear polymers, all three MIP architectures exhibit enhanced tumbling in shear flow and lower normal stress differences in extensional flow. While polyrotaxanes show higher shear and extensional viscosities, polycatenanes and daisy chains have lower viscosities. In extensional flow, polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes extend earlier than linear polymers. We find that mechanical bonds suppress shear thinning and alter the coil-stretch transition observed in linear polymers. These effects arise from the mechanically bonded rings in MIPs, which expand the polymer profile in gradient direction and increase backbone stiffness due to ring-backbone repulsions. This study provides key insights into MIP flow properties, providing the foundation for their systematic development in engineering applications.</p>

In contrast to binary mixtures in one-dimensional chains, we reveal that the binding energy of the clusters shows a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction strengths for small tunneling rates, developing a local minimum for intermediate attractive interactions. The findings of this work highlight the difference between the binding mechanisms of binary bosonic mixtures in one- and higher-dimensional lattices.</p>

            <p>Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</p>

            <p>Accurate quantification of the energy distribution of backscattered electrons (BSEs) contributing to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns remains as an active challenge. This study introduces an energy-resolved EBSD methodology based on a monolithic active pixel sensor direct electron detector and an electron-counting algorithm to enable the energy quantification of individual BSEs, providing direct measurements of electron energy spectra within diffraction patterns. Following detector calibration of the detector signal as a function of primary beam energy, measurements using a 12 keV primary beam on Si(100) reveal a broad BSE energy distribution across the diffraction pattern, extending down to 3 keV. Furthermore, an angular dependence in the weighted average BSE energy is observed, closely matching predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. Pixel-resolved energy maps reveal subtle modulations at Kikuchi band edges, offering insights into the backscattering process. By applying energy filtering within spectral windows as narrow as 2 keV centered on the primary beam energy, significant enhancement in pattern clarity and high-frequency detail is observed. Notably, BSEs in the 9--10 keV range dominate Kikuchi pattern formation, while BSEs in the 2--8 keV range, despite having undergone substantial energy loss, still produce Kikuchi patterns. By enabling energy determination at the single-electron level, this approach introduces a versatile tool-set for expanding the quantitative capabilities of EBSD, thereby offering the potential to deepen the understanding of diffraction contrast mechanisms and to advance the precision of crystallographic measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional metal coupled with higher symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$,\ where those with $X=d,g,i$ are altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to $X=p,d,f,g,i$. Although the system is metallic, provided the Dirac gap is tiny, we demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity is periodic in $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X $-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>The formation and properties of a supersolid structure in a three-component ultracold Bose gas mixture at T=0 are investigated theoretically. The system consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K component, forming a stable "dimer" structure, which displays vibrational modes analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component, satisfying the criteria for supersolidity. This expands the class of known supersolids by adding a system where mediated binding, rather than intrinsic long-range interactions or engineered band-structures as in previously known supersolids, is the key organizing principle, thereby offering new directions for both theory and experiment. The low-energy excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical diatomic chain, coexisting with low-energy superfluid (Goldstone-type) modes.</p>

            <p>Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling.

These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</p>

            <h2>Application of perturbation theory to finding vibrational frequencies of a spheroid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.O. Nestoklon, L. Saviot, S.V. Goupalov</p>
            <p>We apply perturbation theory of boundary conditions, originally developed by A.B. Migdal and independently by S.A. Moszkowski for deformed atomic nuclei, to finding eigenfrequencies of Raman-active spheroidal modes of a spheroid from these of a sphere and compare the outcomes with the results of numerical calculations for CdSe and silver nanoparticles. The modes are characterized by the total angular momentum $j=2$ and are five-fold degenerate for a sphere but split into three distinct modes, characterized by the absolute value of the total angular momentum projection onto the spheroidal axis, in case of a spheroid. The perturbation method works well in case of the rigid boundary conditions, with the displacement field set to zero at the boundary, and accurately predicts the splittings when the spheroidal shape is close to a sphere, but fails in case of the stress-free boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, K. Levin</p>
            <p>While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekulé ordering in moiré graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekulé modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Elastic Property Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengfei Gao, Haidi Wang</p>
            <p>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as efficient tools for materials simulation, yet their reliability for elastic property prediction remains unclear. Here, we present a systematic benchmark of four uMLIPs -- MatterSim, MACE, SevenNet, and CHGNet -- against first-principles data for nearly 11\,000 elastically stable materials from the Materials Project database. The results show that SevenNet achieves the highest accuracy, MACE and MatterSim balance accuracy with efficiency, while CHGNet performs less effectively overall. To further improve predictive quality, we perform targeted fine-tuning on all four uMLIPs using strained configurations derived from 185 high-error materials. After fine-tuning, CHGNet exhibits the largest overall improvement, with an average mean absolute percentage error reduction of about 23\%, followed by MatterSim at around 21\% and SevenNet at 18\%, whereas MACE shows a performance degradation of roughly 14\%. This work provides quantitative guidance for model selection and data refinement, advancing uMLIPs toward reliable applications in mechanical property prediction.</p>

            <h2>From Three-Particle Dynamics to the Structural Origin of the Arrow of Time in Classical and Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuhei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>This paper presents a unified formulation of the origin of the arrow of time in classical and quantum mechanics. We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete example in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we identify coarse-graining as the essential ingredient responsible for macroscopic time asymmetry. We then formulate a general structural criterion for the thermodynamic arrow of time. We show that when microscopic time evolution forms a group while the induced macroscopic evolution forms only a semigroup, macroscopic time-reversal symmetry is necessarily broken. We prove that this semigroup structure arises if and only if the coarse-graining map from microscopic to macroscopic states is non-injective. This result holds independently of whether the underlying system is classical or quantum. In the quantum case, using density matrices, antiunitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we show that macroscopic irreversibility follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the microscopic laws. Our results demonstrate that the thermodynamic arrow of time has a universal structural origin: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining.</p>

            <h2>Quasiperiodicity-induced bulk localization with self similarity in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Peng Wang, Chuo-Kai Chang, Ryo Okugawa, Chen-Hsuan Hsu</p>
            <p>We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian system subject to a quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong-Kun Wang, Shifeng Qian, An-Dong Fan, Si Li</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, recently identified as a third class of collinear magnetic materials, have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics. Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain. Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James V. Raj, Xiaohan Sun, Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall, Mason A. Porter</p>
            <p>Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller total effective resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. Moreover, HuPPI networks are consistently more robust under both random edge removals and curvature-based targeted edge removals, maintaining larger connected components for larger fractions of removed edges than their PoPPI counterparts. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns.</p>

            <p>Moiré patterns are a central motif in van der Waals heterostructures arising from the superposition of two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate lattices. These patterns reveal a wealth of correlated effects, influencing electronic, magnetic, and structural phenomena. While diffraction techniques typically resolve multiple moiré wave-vectors corresponding to the incommensurate nature of the underlying lattices, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) often reveals only a dominant superperiod. In this work, we address this apparent discrepancy through an STM study of a twisted monolayer of CrCl3 on Au(111). We observe the coexistence of several moiré patterns at a fixed twist angle, whose relative intensity depends on the tunneling bias. Fourier analysis of STM data uncovers hidden higher-order moiré components not visible in STM topographic images, while spectroscopy maps reveal that the spectral weight of each pattern varies with electron energy. Our results establish that STM selectively probes on the same area distinct moiré modulations depending on electronic confinement, providing a unified framework that reconciles real space and reciprocal space observations of complex moiré superstructures.</p>

            <h2>A sine-square deformation approach to quantum critical points in one-dimensional systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Miyazaki, Shiori Tanigawa, Giacomo Marmorini, Nobuo Furukawa, Daisuke Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that "if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.</p>

As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fröhlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</p>

The many tools used to describe current fluctuations are scattered across different communities: quantum opticians often use stochastic master equations, while a prevalent approach in condensed matter physics is provided by full counting statistics. These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcell D. Kovács, Christopher J. Turner, Lluis Masanes, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p < 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</p>

We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</p>

            <p>Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Sylos Labini</p>
            <p>Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with { varying resolutions and box sizes}, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</p>

            <p>The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</p>

The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zemin Xu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu</p>
            <p>Here, we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion (TACE), a unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space, enabling systematic and consistent prediction of arbitrary structure-dependent tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of irreducible Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including computational levels, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic and dispersion effects. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials. This includes in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, Hessian, external-field responses, charged and magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, heterogeneous catalysis, and even superior performance within the uMLIP benchmark. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-tensor-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.</p>

Within the framework of adiabatic hydrodynamization, the approach to a nonthermal attractor is described by the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. Using an exactly solvable kinetic theory -- the longitudinally expanding, overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic scattering -- we establish a direct correspondence between the eigenmodes of adiabatic hydrodynamization and the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. This equivalence suggests a general framework for identifying universal dynamical structures in nonequilibrium systems. As a byproduct, we derive analytic prescaling solutions for strongly longitudinally expanding systems.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Hutsalyuk, Márton Lájer, Giuseppe Mussardo, Andrea Stampiggi</p>
            <p>We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Li, Yuhui Li, Jianzhao Wu, Luxuan Zhang, Maoyuan Li, Chaochao Wu, Zhenzhong Wang</p>
            <p>Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</p>

            <h2>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</p>

            <h2>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qidong He</p>
            <p>We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a<0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a>0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture under the additional condition that $3a>\lambda$, which corresponds physically to the regime where vacancies, as opposed to misaligned dimers, are the dominant mechanism for decorrelation, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</p>

            <p>The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Predictions of Process-Induced Deformation in Carbon/Epoxy Composites Using a Deep Operator Network</h2>

            <p>Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</p>

            <p>Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.</p>

            <p>The Zitterbewegung phenomenon in multiband electronic systems is known to be subtly related to the charge conductivity, Berry curvature and the Chern number. Here we show that some spin-dependent properties as the optical spin conductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are also entangled with the Zitterbewegung amplitudes. We also show that in multiband Dirac-type Hamiltonians, a direct link between the Zitterbewegung and the spin textures and spin transition amplitudes can be established. The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.</p>

            <p>In superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the superconducting diode effect may be generated by interference of multiple harmonic components in the current-phase relationships (CPRs) of different branches forming SQUID loops.

Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation.</p>

            <h2>Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanbit Oh, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</p>

            <h2>Fractional quantization by interaction of arbitrary strength in gapless flat bands with divergent quantum geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Yang, Dawei Zhai, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.</p>

            <h2>Spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductor with spin-orbit interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We study impacts of spin-orbit interactions on the spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductors, motivated by the anomolous superconducting properties in the van der Waals quasicrystal Ta$_{1.6}$Te under magnetic fields. We consider the Penrose tiling model with $s$-wave pairing as a representative system and include anisotropic spin-orbit interactions allowed for the quasicrystal structure. It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged. When there are both kinds of the spin-orbit interactions, temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for any field directions is suppressed.</p>

            <p>Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</p>

            <p>Kapitza-Dirac scattering, the diffraction of matter waves from a standing light field, is widely utilized in ultracold gases, but its behavior in the strongly interacting regime is an open question. Here we develop a numerically-exact two-body description of Kapitza-Dirac scattering for two contact-interacting atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to a pulsed optical lattice, enabling us to obtain the numerically exact dynamics. We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers a powerful route to manipulate material properties. However, it is unclear whether and how quantized fields affect crystals periodicity. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described.</p>

            <p>Polariton condensation is a potential system state for performing analog computations, given that it exhibits quantum behavior at macroscopic scales readily probed with low-cost optical methods. Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

            <p>Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</p>

Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</p>

            <p>The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p>

            <p>Dynamical control of quantum matter is a challenging, yet promising direction for probing strongly correlated states. Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Interferometric probe for the zeros of the many-body wavefunction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wayne J. Chetcuti, Anna Minguzzi, Juan Polo, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>The nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction are fundamental geometric features that encode critical information regarding particle statistics and their interaction. Directly probing these structures, particularly in correlated quantum systems, remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we provide rigorous results on the structure of the many-body wavefunction and propose to use an interferometric technique to probe its zeros in ultra-cold atomic systems. Specifically, we refer to the so-called heterodyne interferometric reconstruction of the phase of the many-body wavefunction. We prove that the sought nodal surfaces show up as specific discontinuities in the interference fringes. Following Leggett, both `symmetry-dictated' nodal surfaces, due to particle statistics, and `non-symmetry dictated' nodal surfaces emerging from interaction effects, can be probed. We demonstrate how the spin degrees of freedom, effectively modifying the structure of the nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction, leave distinct fingerprints in the resulting interference pattern. Our work addresses important features of the structure of the many-body wavefunction that are broadly relevant for quantum science ranging from conceptual aspects to computational questions of extended systems and quantum simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Bunney, Lucca Marchetti, Domenico Di Sante, Carsten Honerkamp, Stephan Rachel</p>
            <p>A third monolayer of tin atoms on the semiconductor substrate Si(111) has been shown to become superconducting upon six to ten percent hole doping. Experiments have reported promising results hinting at a superconducting chiral $d$-wave order parameter. Here we examine Sn/Si(111) by combining most recent ab initio results, quasi-particle interference calculations, state-of-the-art truncated-unity functional renormalization group simulations and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis. We show remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical quasi-particle interference data both in the metallic and superconducting regimes. The interacting phase diagram reveals that the superconductivity is indeed chiral $d$-wave with Chern number $C=4$. Surprisingly, magnetically ordered phases are absent, instead we find charge density wave order, as observed in related compounds, as a competing phase. Our results demonstrate that Sn/Si(111) is an outstanding candidate material for chiral topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Unreasonable effectiveness of unsupervised learning in identifying Majorana topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Taylor, Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>In unsupervised learning, the training data for deep learning does not come with any labels, thus forcing the algorithm to discover hidden patterns in the data for discerning useful information. This, in principle, could be a powerful tool in identifying topological order since topology does not always manifest in obvious physical ways (e.g., topological superconductivity) for its decisive confirmation. The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space. This may be a useful tool in identifying topology in Majorana nanowires.</p>

            <p>Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) represent a paradigmatic instance of quantum fluids in hollow geometries exhibiting phenomena that bridge from ultracold atomic to astrophysical realms. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of the dynamics, thermodynamics, and collective excitations of shell-shaped BECs, synthesizing two decades of our group's theoretical work in light of recent experimental breakthroughs. We begin by analyzing the evolution of a BEC from filled-sphere to hollow-shell geometries, illustrating the necessity of microgravity conditions to avoid gravitational sag. We then analyze collective modes structure across this evolution and pinpoint a universal dip in the frequency spectra as well as mode reconfiguration due to inner-surface excitations as robust signatures of the hollowing-out transition. Turning to vortex physics, we show that the closed-surface topology enforces vortex-antivortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs and that the natural annihilation of these pairs can be stabilized by rotation, with the critical rotation rate depending on shell thickness. In the thermodynamic domain, we investigate the interplay between shell inflation and the BEC phase transition, where adiabatic expansions lead to condensate depletion. This behavior motivates a study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of shell-shaped BECs; we perform such a study by constructing a time-dependent dynamic technique that can capture the evolution in both adiabatice and non-adiabatic regimes. Finally, we review recent experimental realizations of shell-shaped BECs, including the landmark creation of ultracold shells aboard the International Space Station, and outline prospects for exploring quantum fluids in curved geometries.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fields in a cold atomic simulator: relaxation and phase locking in tunnel-coupled 1D bosonic quasi-condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Fitos, G. Takács</p>
            <p>We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning for Predicting Magnetization from X-ray Diffraction of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Using Simple Physics-Based Data Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank M. Abel, Paige Burke, Daniel Wines, Brian Donovan, Michelle E. Jamer, Kamal Choudhary</p>
            <p>Automation and high-throughput characterization and synthesis for material development are becoming increasingly common; these approaches require machine learning (ML) tools to assess material properties, ideally based on a single measurement. Here, ML models are developed to predict magnetization from X-ray diffraction (XRD) for iron oxide nanoparticles. Our approach is to first develop a set of simulated data that links modulated XRD, based on a crystallographic information file (CIF), to a simple magnetic model to determine magnetization at a given magnetic field, thereby enabling us to train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models on a large amount of simulated data. The models are validated by synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles and measuring their crystal structure via XRD and room-temperature magnetization curves. In doing so, we can fine-tune both the training hyperparameters and the optimal size of the simulated datasets used to train the models. Through this optimization, the best models can achieve an $R^2$ greater than 0.9 for five experimental samples, used for tuning, for predicting the max magnetization (at 2.8 T) of the measurement. Lastly, we demonstrate reasonable predictions on the full magnetization vs. magnetic field curve, showing that the RF model excels at predicting the high magnetic field values, which is key for determining the success of an iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis for applications like magnetic particle imaging (MPI), thermal magnetic particle imaging (T-MPI), and hyperthermia.</p>

            <p>Muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements of internal magnetic field shifts, known as the muon Knight shift, is used for determining pairing symmetries in superconductors. While this technique has been especially effective for $f$-electron-based heavy-fermion superconductors, it remains challenging in $d$-electron-based superconductors such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where the Knight shift is intrinsically small. Here, we report high-precision muon Knight shift measurements of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe that using multiple pieces of crystals, a common practice in $\mu$SR measurements, induces a substantial paramagnetic shift below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, when a weak magnetic field is applied. We attribute such an unresolved paramagnetic shift to stray fields generated by neighboring diamagnetic crystals. To avoid this, one piece of crystal was used in this study. We experimentally determine the muon Knight shift of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the normal state to be -116$\pm$7 ppm. By combining the observed muon Knight shift with independently determined bulk magnetization data from the same crystal used in $\mu$SR and carefully separating various contributions to the shift, we confirm a significant reduction in the spin Knight shift below $T_c$, consistent with spin-singlet-like pairing. This result constitutes the precise muon Knight shift measurement in a $d$-electron-based superconductor. Our results highlight the potential of $\mu$SR as a powerful complementary technique to the established method of nuclear magnetic resonance for probing the spin susceptibility in superconductors.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the formation of Spin Faraday waves in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate under the stripe phase and explores the dispersion relation under three different phases. We discover that the SFW exhibit temporal and spatial patterns when the interaction is modulated periodically, and appear with resonant waves and higher order harmonics. SFW can be excited even when the modulation frequency resonates with the trap frequency. Furthermore, we study the dispersion relation of these Faraday modes through periodic modulation, which agrees well with our theoretical results under three quantum phases. Our work indicates novel physical phenomena originating from the introduction of spin-orbit coupling and provides a possible method for studying the dispersion of Bose gases.</p>

            <p>To optimize the processing conditions for the (Cr,Fe)S non-equilibrium phase with a pyrrhotite-type structure, the phase states and magnetic properties of the specimens obtained at various sintering temperatures were investigated. A slightly off-stoichiometric composition of Cr23Fe23S54 (approximately (Cr,Fe)7S8) sintered and quenched from 1323 K indicates a single-phase pyrrhotite-type structure with a layered-NiAs-type structure in which vacancies occupy every two layers (C12/c1; the space number is 15). The compound shows fully compensated ferrimagnetic behavior at a magnetization compensated temperature of approximately 200 K. The magnetic behavior exhibits a typical N-type ferrimagnet, as predicted by Néel. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, it is found that the compound is composed of Fe2+ and Cr3+. The large magnetic coercivity of 38 kOe at 5 K is also unique and can be applied to spintronic devices. Furthermore, changing the quenching temperature enables control of the degree of order of the vacancies in the interlayer and results in tuning of the magnetization compensated temperature. First-principles calculations show a pseudo-gap located at the Fermi level in the up-spin band, suggesting high spin polarization as well as the NiAs-type structure indicated in the previous our report.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ruby lattice with uniform first- and second-neighbor interactions, which forms a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra. Using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), we study the ground state of the system to find that it assumes a gapped threefold-degenerate simplex crystal ground state, with strong singlets formed on pairs of neighboring triangles. We argue that the formation of the simplex singlet ground state at the isotropic point relates to the weak inter-triangle coupling limit where an effective spin-chirality Hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice exhibits an extensively degenerate ground state manifold of singlet coverings at the mean-field level. Under an applied Zeeman field, the iPEPS simulations uncover magnetization plateaus at $m/m_s = 0, 1/3, 1/2,$ and $2/3$, separated by intermediate supersolid phases, all breaking the sixfold rotational symmetry of the lattice. Unlike the checkerboard lattice, these plateaus cannot be described by strongly localized magnons.</p>

            <p>Soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi, which undergoes a structural transition at $T_0=12$ K followed by antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\text{N}}=9.5$ K, have been investigated using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. Pronounced softening was detected in the transverse acoustic modes corresponding to the $(yz+zx)$-type monoclinic distortion, consistent with the experimentally determined triclinic structure. Remarkably, the softening persists up to the zone boundary along (0, 0, $q$), indicating a short correlation length of the lattice instability. This instability, characterized by a Curie-type strain susceptibility, is interpreted as a consequence of the on-site $4f$-$5d$ hybridization, which is intrinsic to this crystal structure due to the lack of inversion symmetry at the two Ce sites.</p>

            <p>Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.</p>

            <p>Dirac fermions, characterized by their linear dispersion and relativistic nature, have emerged as a prominent class of quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. While the Dirac equation, initially developed in the context of high-energy physics, provides a remarkable framework for describing the electronic properties of these materials, the inherent symmetry constraints of condensed matter often lead to deviations from the idealized paradigm. In particular, three-dimensional Dirac fermions in solids often exhibit anisotropic behavior, challenging the notion of perfect symmetry inherent in the Dirac equation. Here, we report the observation of isotropic massive Dirac fermions in LaAlSi through Landau level spectroscopy. The presence of three-dimensional massive Dirac fermions across the Fermi energy is demonstrated by quantized and semiclassical analyses of the magnetic field evolution of Landau level transitions. The isotropic topological nature, Fermi velocity, and Dirac mass are evidenced by the identical magneto-infrared response among the Faraday and three Voigt geometries. Furthermore, we observe an unusually large oscillator strength in the zeroth Landau level transition of the Dirac fermion, compared to transitions with higher indices. This phenomenon, supported by model calculations, can be attributed to the combined effects of the partial excitation of Dirac fermion and the resonant dielectric coupling with the Weyl plasma. Our work provides a strategy for realizing ideal quasiparticle excitations and their coupling effects in condensed matter systems, offering a platform for exploring relativistic physics.</p>

            <p>Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</p>

            <p>The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.</p>

            <p>Analysis of the thermal and baric evolution of resistance in $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+\delta}$ enabled the construction of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram, which prominently displays a critical boundary, $P^{MIT}_c(T)$, marking the transition from localized to hole-type extended states. The relatively low critical pressures [$P^{MIT}_c(T) \approx 3$-8 GPa] suggest that, as $P \rightarrow P_c$ in this narrow-gap, strongly correlated charge-transfer system, both the hybridization strength and the charge-transfer character are progressively enhanced - ultimately leading to the emergence of metallicity. Emphasizing the electronic nature of this transition, pressure-dependent structural analyses at room temperature reveal no associated structural phase transition at $P^{MIT}_c(T)$; the system retains a (weakly tetragonally distorted) quasicubic perovskite structure with Murnaghan-type compressibility up to 30\,GPa. The emergence of hole delocalization and metallic conduction, coupled with suppressed antiferromagnetism, suggests proximity to quantum criticality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baruch Meerson, Ohad Vilk</p>
            <p>We develop an age-structured hydrodynamic (HD) theory which describes the collective behavior of $N\gg 1$ anomalously diffusing particles under stochastic renewal resetting. The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H>0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities. For model A the (normalized to unity) steady-state density coincides with the steady-state probability density of a single particle undergoing sBM with resetting to the origin. For model B, and for the scaled Brownian bees, the HD steady-state densities are markedly different: in particular, they have compact supports for all $H>0$. The age-structured HD formalism can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols which introduce global inter-particle correlations.</p>

By further presenting two counterexamples where the bound predicts trivial results, we shed light on the conditions under which the Leggett's bound serves as a good predictor.</p>

            <p>Coarse-grained continuous descriptions for lipid bilayers are typically based on minimizing the Helfrich energy. Such models consider the fluid properties of these structures only implicitly and have been shown to nicely reproduce equilibrium properties. Model extensions that also address the dynamics of these structures are surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. They explicitly account for membrane viscosity. However, these models also usually treat the lipid bilayer as a homogeneous continuum, neglecting the molecular degrees of freedom of the lipids. Here, we derive refined models which consider in addition a scalar order parameter representing the molecular alignment of the lipids along the surface normal. Starting from hydrodynamic surface liquid crystal models, we obtain a hydrodynamic surface Landau--Helfrich model for asymmetric lipid bilayers and a surface Beris--Edwards model for symmetric lipid bilayers. The fully ordered case for both models leads to the known surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. Besides more detailed continuous models for lipid bilayers, we therefore also provide an alternative derivation of surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models.</p>

We further investigate the superconducting mechanism mediated by spin fluctuations arising from purely repulsive interactions by applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the Hubbard model. The gap symmetry obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg equation is $d$-wave, which corresponds to a $d+id'$-wave superconducting state with a Chern number of $8$, including the spin degree of freedom. The $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which possesses the largest spectral weight at finite energies arising from the incipient flat band, gives rise to an effective spin-singlet pairing glue between rim sites.</p>

            <h2>Interactions between droplets in immiscible liquid suspensions and the influence of surfactants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. J. Archer, D. N. Sibley, B. D. Goddard</p>
            <p>We develop a general method for determining the effective interaction potential between two or more droplets suspended within a fluid phase. Our approach is based on classical density functional theory. Here, we apply the method to determine the interaction potential between oil droplets suspended in water and also consider the influence of adding a third species, alcohol. This ternary mixture is that found in the ouzo beverage. The ouzo system exhibits spontaneous emulsification when the neat spirit is mixed with water. The oil emulsion that forms has been observed to be surprisingly long-lived. Here we show that the alcohol in the system does indeed play a role in making the droplets more stable, by decreasing the oil-water interfacial tension and therefore also the strength of the attractive interactions between droplets. Within our theory, the surfactant nature of the alcohol can be enhanced without changing the bulk fluid thermodynamics. In fact, our theory can be used to model surfactant mixtures. In this model, the effective interaction between pairs of oil droplets can become repulsive, with a free-energy barrier to droplets merging, thus making them stable.</p>

            <h2>Exceptional Excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian physics is reshaping our understanding of quantum systems by revealing states and phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. While non-Hermiticity is typically associated with gain-loss processes in open systems, we uncover a fundamentally different route to non-Hermitian behavior emerging from non-equilibrium correlations. In photoexcited semiconductors, the effective interaction between electrons and holes gives rise to a pseudo-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Hamiltonian (PH-BSH) that governs excitonic states in the presence of excited populations. Within this framework, we identify a previously unknown class of excitonic quasiparticles - exceptional excitons - corresponding to exceptional points embedded inside the electron-hole continuum. Exceptional excitons emerge at the onset of population inversion, and represent the strongly renormalized counterparts of the system's equilibrium excitons. They are spatially localized, protected against hybridization with the continuum, and remain long-lived even in regimes where conventional excitons undergo a Mott transition. Crucially, exceptional excitons appear only when the PH-BSH is evaluated with non-thermal, resonantly generated carrier populations that support an excitonic superfluid. Ab initio results for monolayer WS_2 explicitly demonstrate this scenario and show that exceptional excitons can be realized with existing ultrafast pumping techniques. We also identify distinctive optical and photoemission signatures that enable their unambiguous detection.</p>

            <h2>Impact of nonlocal spatial correlations for different lattice geometries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Leusch, Alessandro Toschi, Andreas Hausoel, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Georg Rohringer</p>
            <p>We analyze the impact of the lattice geometry on the thermodynamic transition to magnetically ordered phases in strongly interacting electron systems for various Bravais lattices in three and four dimensions, including both local and nonlocal correlation effects. In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$\Gamma$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries. For the fcc lattice, on the other hand, the ordered phase observed in DMFT vanishes completely within D$\Gamma$A which is consistent with the existence of strong geometric frustration in this lattice.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid acousto-optical spin control in quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz Kuniej, Paweł Machnikowski, Michał Gawełczyk</p>
            <p>Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Chen, Yangfeng Fu, Weiqiang Yu, Rong Yu, Z. Y. Xie</p>
            <p>We propose a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045128 (2017)] with the automatic differentiation technique, our approach can reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, and therefore enables highly efficient variational ground-state calculations. We demonstrate the capability of this framework through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. Even without GPU acceleration or symmetry implimention, we have achieved the bond dimension of 9 and obtained accurate ground-state energy and consistent order parameters compared to prior studies. In particular, we confirm the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model. We have further discussed the convergence of the algorithm and its potential improvements. Our work provides a promising route for large-scale tensor network calculations of two-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Gonze, Christian Tantardini, Antoine Levitt</p>
            <p>The temperature dependence of most solid-state properties is dominated by lattice vibrations, but metals display notable purely electronic effects at low temperature, such as the linear specific heat and the linear entropy, that were derived by Sommerfeld for the non-interacting electron gas via the low-temperature expansion of Fermi-Dirac integrals. Here we treat temperature as a perturbation within density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). For finite temperature, we show how self-consistency screens the bare, temperature-induced density change obtained in the non-interacting picture: the inverse transpose of the electronic dielectric operator, that includes Adler-Wiser and a term related to the shift in Fermi level, links the self-consistent density response to the bare thermal density change. This approach is implemented in DFTK, and demonstrated by the computation of the second-order derivative of the free energy, and the first-order derivative of entropy for aluminum. Then, we examine the $T\!\to\!0$ limit. The finite temperature formalism contains divergences, that we cure using the Sommerfeld expansion to analyze metallic systems at 0 K. The electronic free energy is quadratic in $T$ provided the Fermi level is not at a Van Hove singularity of the density of states. If the latter happens, another temperature behavior might appear, depending on the type of Van Hove singularity, that we analyze. Our formulation applies to systems periodic in one, two, or three dimensions, and provides a basis for studying temperature-dependent electronic instabilities (e.g., charge-density waves) within density-functional theory and DFPT.</p>

            <h2>How Spatially Modulated Activity Reshapes Active Polymer Conformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Malgaretti, Emanuele Locatelli</p>
            <p>Active polymers are driven out of equilibrium by internal forces and exhibit conformational properties that differ fundamentally from those of passive chains. Here we study how spatially modulated tangential activity reshapes the conformations of semiflexible polymers. Using a continuum Rouse model with bending rigidity, we develop a systematic expansion in the limit of weak activity and derive analytical expressions for mode correlations, gyration radius, and end-to-end distance under sinusoidally varying propulsion. We show that spatially structured activity breaks self-similar scaling and induces a mode-dependent transition between polymer shrinking and swelling. Uniform or low-mode forcing produces compact, globule-like conformations, whereas higher modes generate alternating stretched and compressed segments, leading to globally swollen chains. Different polymer sizes respond differently to activity, allowing for conformations that are compact in gyration radius yet extended in end-to-end distance. Langevin dynamics simulations quantitatively confirm the theoretical predictions. Our results demonstrate that even weak, patterned activity provides a powerful mechanism to control polymer conformations far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>An electron beam may experience an anomalous spatial shift during an interface scattering process. Here, we investigate this phenomenon for reflection from mirror-symmetry-protected nodal-ring semimetals, which are characterized by an integer topological charge $\chi_h$. We show that the shift is generally enhanced by the presence of nodal rings, and the ring's geometry can be inferred from the profile of shift vectors in the interface momentum plane. Importantly, the anomalous shift encodes the topological information of the ring, where the circulation of the shift vector field $\kappa_s$ over a semicircle is governed by the topological charge, with a simple relationship: $\kappa_s=-2\pi \chi_h$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shift and its circulation reflect distinct features of topological phase transitions of the charged rings. This study uncovers a novel physical signature of topological nodal rings and positions anomalous scattering shifts as a powerful tool for probing topological band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu. Kozitsky</p>
            <p>Half a century ago, Ihor Yukhnovskii elaborated a method of studying the critical point of the three-dimensional Ising model based on a layer-by-layer integration in the space of collective variables. His method was an alternative to that based on the $\varepsilon$-expansion for which K. G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982. However, Yukhnovskii's technique, which yielded similar results, provided even deeper insight into the nature of this phenomenon. At that time, we, professor's students, saw only this aspect of his theory. Later, I realized that the mentioned Yukhnovskii's work naturally fits into a more general context of the turbulent development of quantum field theory and statistical physics in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The aim of the present article is to look at the main aspects and the impact of Yukhnovskii's theory from this perspective.</p>

            <p>We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Selective Thermoelectric Transport in a Triangular Spin Ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranjini Bhattacharya, Souvik Roy</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate spin-resolved thermoelectric transport in a triangular ladder geometry hosting antiferromagnetic spin alignment, where lattice topology and magnetic ordering jointly enable highly efficient spin-selective energy conversion. The inherent geometric frustration of the ladder, together with intrinsic spin-filtering mechanisms, is shown to promote a pronounced separation between spin channels. Implementing spin-dependent onsite modulations, such as binary asymmetric potentials, induces pronounced spin splitting in the transmission spectrum, enabling controlled spin-selective transport and highlighting the role of lattice engineering in tailoring spin-dependent thermoelectric response. Additional control is achieved through modulation of the hopping amplitudes, which activates multiple transport pathways and allows fine tuning of spin-dependent conduction. A detailed evaluation of charge and spin thermoelectric coefficients reveals a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric performance, with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaching large values in optimized parameter regimes. Notably, the spin figure of merit systematically surpasses its charge counterpart, underscoring the decisive role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in amplifying spin thermoelectric efficiency. Our findings provide a versatile theoretical platform for designing low-dimensional spin-caloritronic devices with enhanced functionality.</p>

            <p>An atomistic structural model for melt-quenched B$_2$O$_3$ glass has eluded the simulation community so far. The difficulty lies in the abundance of the six-membered boroxol rings - an intermediate-range order motif suggested through Raman and NMR spectroscopy - which is challenging to obtain in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we report the development of a DFT-accurate machine-learned potential for B$_2$O$_3$ and employ quench rates as low as 10$^{9}$ K/s to obtain B$_2$O$_3$ glasses with more than 30% of boron atoms in boroxol rings. Also, we show that the pressure, and consequently the boroxol fraction, in the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations critically depends on the range of the geometry descriptor used in the embedding neural network, and at least a 9 $\unicode{x212B}$ range is required. The boroxol ring fraction increases with decreasing quench rate. Finally, amorphous B$_2$O$_3$ configurations display a minimum in energy at a boroxol fraction of 75%, intriguingly close to the experimental estimate in B$_2$O$_3$ glass.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongyi Zhang, Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Hoi Chun Po, Jiangping Hu, Xianxin Wu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in both bulk and thin-film bilayer nickelates has garnered significant attention. In this study, inspired by recent STM experiments on thin films, we investigate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) characteristics of bilayer nickelates in both normal and superconducting states to identify their Fermiology and pairing symmetry. We demonstrate that the mirror symmetry inherent in the bilayer structure induces mirror-selective quasiparticle scattering by establishing selection rules based on the mirror properties of impurities and the mirror eigenvalues of electronic wavefunctions. This mirror-selective scattering allows for the differentiation of distinct Fermiologies, as QPI patterns vary markedly between scenarios with and without the $d_{z^2}$-bonding Fermi surface (FS). Furthermore, it enables the separate detection of sign changes in superconducting gaps both within the same FS and between different FSs. Crucially, if the mirror-symmetry-enforced selection rules are ignored, the QPI response of an $s_\pm$-wave state can masquerade as that of a conventional $s$-wave state, leading to a misidentification of the pairing symmetry. When combined with field-dependent and reference QPI measurements, this approach facilitates the precise determination of pairing symmetry, even in the presence of FS-dependent gaps and gap anisotropy. Additionally, we discuss practical considerations for STM measurements to effectively identify the pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that mirror-selective QPI is a powerful tool for distinguishing between different Fermiologies and pairing states, which is helpful in pinning down pairing symmetry and revealing the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>Streamlined prediction of the electronic properties of photoactive materials warrants a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach that (i) yields reliable bandgaps, (ii) is free of empirically tuned parameters, and (iii) exhibits low computational overhead. Here we show that for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4 kesterite photovoltaic materials, all three of these demands are met by the DFT plus Hubbard U technique (DFT+U) with corrective parameters evaluated via minimum-tracking linear response. The predicted bandgaps are found to even marginally outperform those from the self-consistent GW approach. Key to this method's success is the application of Hubbard U corrections to all atomic subspaces that dominate the conduction and valence band edges, as opposed to the conventional approach of correcting 3d and 4f atomic states. Intriguingly, the inclusion of Hund's J corrections via the extended DFT+U+J functional significantly worsens these results. This under performance can be ameliorated through the use of the Burgess-Linscott-O'Regan (BLOR) flat-plane based Hubbard U plus Hund's J functional, with bandgap predictions in close agreement with the conventional DFT+U method. The DFT+U method is also used to predict defect-induced changes to the bandgap and associated formation energies, in 1,728-atom supercells.</p>

            <p>The crystal and magnetic structures of the nitride antiperovskite Mn$_3$GeN reveals ferrimagnetic order stemming from a distorted kagome-derived lattice of the Mn atoms. Polycrystalline Mn$_3$GeN was synthesized via a solid-state reaction and characterized using neutron powder diffraction, DC magnetometry, and first-principles calculations. Rietveld refinement reveals near-stoichiometric composition (Mn$_3$GeN$_{0.94(1)}$) adopting a tetragonal $I4/mcm$ structure at $T$ = 500 K and below, featuring axially distorted and tilted [NMn$_6$] octahedra that result in a buckled Mn kagome lattice. On heating, the tetragonal distortion and octahedral tilt angle decrease continuously before transitioning to the cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ antiperovskite phase at $T \approx$ 524 K. Neutron diffraction and magnetometry together reveal noncollinear ferrimagnetic ordering. For 30 K $\le T \le$ 500 K, the magnetic structure is described by a single propagation vector, $k$ = (0, 0, 0), with inequivalent Mn1 and Mn2 sublattices that couple antiferromagnetically to yield a net moment. Density functional theory-based calculations show the different local moments originate from the bandwidths associated with the distinct Mn-N bond lengths. The temperature dependence of the sublattice moments indicates a compensation-like crossover between Mn1- and Mn2-derived magnetization near 380 K. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized subtlety in the magnetic and structural behavior of Mn$_3$GeN, highlighting the interplay between structural distortions, magnetic ordering, and electronic structure in kagome-derived antiperovskite materials.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism represents a novel class of collinear antiferromagnetism exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting without net magnetization, driven by lattice symmetry rather than spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we introduce a coordination-driven chemical strategy to realize altermagnetic (AM) spin splitting in two-dimensional (2D) planar tetracoordinated Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that replacing centrosymmetric pyrazine (pyz) ligands with non-centrosymmetric imidazole (imz) linkers in Cr-based MOFs reduces lattice symmetry, enabling g-wave AM spin splitting up to 65 meV. Furthermore, frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) allows selective ligand spin polarization, inducing a shift to d-wave AM anisotropy in polycyclic ligand-based 2D MOFs with spin splitting up to 83.9 meV. Microscopic magnetic exchange interactions (J) analysis reveals that ligand-mediated interactions dominate over metal-metal coupling, stabilizing AM order in systems with radical ligands. Interestingly, we further confirm AM spin splitting in spin wave spectrum, where chiral magnon splitting is observed. Finally, we show that AM spin splitting gives rise to experimentally accessible charge to spin conversion, emerging as a linear response in d-wave and as a symmetry-allowed nonlinear effect in g-wave 2D AM MOFs. This work establishes coordination chemistry as a powerful and versatile route to symmetry control in 2D MOFs, enabling rational design of 2D molecular materials with tunable electronic and AM properties for next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions in materials under fast ramp compression are an ongoing research topic, which is part of several global projects like inertial fusion. Currently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination of samples under fast ramp compression is limited to the determination of the sample phase state and the unit cell lattice parameters. Here, we propose to extend this examination route by introducing the Williamson-Hall analysis of the XRD data measured in samples under fast ramp rate conditions. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we performed an analysis for ramp compressed lead $(P = 200 GPa)$ and gold $(P = 1003 GPa)$, which both exhibit a transition from the face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice to the body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice at the studied pressures. The analysis showed that lead under fast ramp compression has a nanocrystalline structure with a crystalline size of $D = (4 \pm 1) nm$ and lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.006 \pm 0.002 $. The effect of extreme hardening of bcc-Pb under fast ramp compression can be explained as the formation of an ultrafine grain structure in this metal. Elemental gold exhibits average crystalline size $D > 12 nm $ and unprecedentedly high, for a pure metallic element, lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.014 \pm 0.001 $ under fast ramp compression.</p>

            <h2>On the origin of the unusual strain morphologies and polar Moiré patterns in twisted ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey Prosandeev, Charles Paillard, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Density functional theory calculations are conducted to understand and reveal the origin of the complex shear strain morphology and of the polar Moiré topological pattern recently observed in twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayers. Our first-principles calculations, along with an original analysis of them allowing the decomposition of forces into the acoustic and optical contributions, point out to the occurrence of forces mostly acting on the {\it acoustic-related} motions to produce the standing waves of the shear strain. Such acoustic waves naturally generate a striking self-organization of the shear strains, and hence create a peculiar gradient of these shear strains. A Moiré dipole pattern, consisting of the interpenetrated arrays of vortices and antivortices made of the electric dipoles, then mostly arises due to the coupling of this gradient of the shear strain with the electric dipoles. Furthermore, other forces, namely acting on the motions associated with the {\it optical phonons}, could also play a role in the formation of these polar vortices and antivortices, but at a smaller extent.</p>

            <p>The thermal transport community is increasingly interested in rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of their measurements. In this work, we argue that Bayesian parameter estimation (BPE) represents a powerful framework for both analysis/fitting and UQ. We provide a detailed walkthrough of the technique (including code to duplicate our results) and example analysis based on measuring the thermal conductance of a gold/sapphire interface with FDTR. Comparisons are made against traditional analysis/UQ techniques adopted by the thermal transport community. Notable advantages of BPE include the interpretability of its results, including the capacity to indicate incorrect input assumptions, as well as a way to balance overall goodness of fit against prior knowledge of feasible parameter values. In some cases, incorporating this additional information can affect not only the magnitude of error bars but the inferred values themselves.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.</p>

Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Michele Campisi</p>
            <p>The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is beginning to reveal the intriguing role that information can play in quantum thermal engines. Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better.</p>

            <p>Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</p>

            <p>All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.</p>

            <h2>Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alison Warman, Sakura Schafer-Nameki</p>
            <p>We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.</p>

            <p>We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</p>

            <p>Free probability provides a framework for describing correlations between non-commuting observables in complex quantum systems whose Hilbert-space states follow maximum-entropy distributions. We examine the robustness of this framework under a minimal deviation from freeness: the coupling of a single ancilla qubit to a Haar-distributed quantum circuit of dimension $D0 \gg 1$. We find that, even in this setting, the correlation functions predicted by free probability theory receive corrections of order $O(1)$. These modifications persist at long times, when the dynamics of the coupled system is already ergodic. We trace their origin to non-uniformly distributed stationary quantum states, which we characterize analytically and confirm numerically.</p>

            <p>We study the statistics of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) after partial measurement on a class of one-dimensional quantum critical states described by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids at low energies. Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itay Gomelski, Jonathan Elyovich, Ariel Kelman, Erez Zohar, Patrick Emonts</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying non-perturbative phenomena in gauge theories. However, conventional approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in imaginary time are limited, as they do not allow real time evolution and suffer from a sign problem in many important cases. Using Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) as a variational ground state ansatz offers an alternative for studying LGTs through a sign-problem-free variational MC. As this method is extended to larger and more complex systems, understanding its numerical behavior becomes essential. While conventional action based MC has been extensively studied, the performance and characteristics of non-action-based MC within the GGFPEPS framework are far less explored. In this work, we investigate these algorithmic aspects, identifying an optimal update size for GGFPEPS-based MC simulations for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $2+1$ dimensions. We show that gauge fixing generally slows convergence, and demonstrate that not exploiting the translation-invariance can, in some cases, improve the computational time scaling of error convergence. We expect that these improvements will allow advancing the simulation to larger and more complex systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the existence and effect of percolation in training deep Neural Networks (NNs) with dropout. Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics. If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Goto, Hector Manuel Lopez Rios, Monika Scholz, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan</p>
            <p>Classical autoassociative memory models have been central to understanding emergent computations in recurrent neural circuits across diverse biological contexts. However, they typically neglect neuromodulatory agents that are known to strongly shape memory capacity and stability. Here we introduce a minimal, biophysically motivated associative memory network where neuropeptide-like signals are modeled by a self-adaptive, activity-dependent gating mechanism. Using many-body simulations and dynamical mean-field theory, we show that such gating fundamentally reorganizes the attractor structure: the network bypasses the classical spin-glass transition, maintaining robust, high-overlap retrieval far beyond the standard critical capacity, without shrinking basins of attraction. Mechanistically, the gate stabilizes transient ghost remnants of stored patterns even far above the Hopfield limit, converting them into multistable attractors. These results demonstrate that neuromodulation-like gating alone can dramatically enhance associative memory capacity, eliminate the sharp Hopfield-style catastrophic breakdown, and reshape the memory landscape, providing a simple, general route to richer memory dynamics and computational capabilities in neuromodulated circuits and neuromorphic architectures.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Intracellular processes often rely on the timely encounter of mobile reaction partners, including intermittently motor-driven organelles. The underlying cytoskeletal network presents a complex landscape that both directs particle movement and introduces quenched disorder through filament organization. We investigate the mean first encounter times for pairs of intermittently processive and diffusive particles, moving in two dimensions with and without a fixed filament network. In unstructured domains, increasing particle run-length enhances exploration of the domain, but tends to slow down the encounter times compared to equivalent diffusing particles. Encounters for long-running particles occur preferentially near the periphery, contrasting with bulk encounters for the purely diffusive case. When particles are unbiased in their runs along dense filament networks, encounters are shown to be well approximated by a continuum run-and-tumble model. For biased particles, regions of convergent filament orientation can serve as traps that slow the overall spatial exploration but can allow for faster encounter rates by funneling particles into regions of reduced dimensionality. These findings provide a framework for estimating intracellular encounter kinetics, highlighting the role of key physical features such as the effective diffusivity, run times, and network architecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. S. Liu, X. Z. Zhang</p>
            <p>Unraveling the mechanisms of ergodicity breaking in complex quantum systems is a central pursuit in nonequilibrium physics. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $\pi$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</p>

            <p>We propose a sensor free, self regulating thermal switch that combines the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE) with a temperature driven spin reorientation transition (SRT) in the rare earth cobalt compound DyCo$_5$. Using density functional theory and the Kubo linear-response formalism, we compute the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)$ and the finite temperature anomalous Nernst conductivity $\alpha_{xy}(T)$ for two magnetization directions, magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. While the intrinsic $\sigma_{xy}$ at the Fermi level remains sizable for both orientations, $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits an about two orders of magnitude contrast in the SRT temperature window. This contrast is consistent with the low temperature Mott relation through the energy slope $\partial_\varepsilon \sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon)\rvert_{E_{\mathrm F}}$ and is traced to strongly peaked Berry curvature hot spots generated by spin orbit coupling induced avoided crossings of Co $3d$ bands. Combining $\alpha_{xy}$ with longitudinal transport coefficients, we estimate device level metrics, namely the anomalous Nernst thermopower $S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$ and the Ettingshausen coefficient $\Pi_{\mathrm{AEE}}=T S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$, and demonstrate robust orientation controlled switching under a fixed in plane bias current. These results establish a materials based route to compact thermal control without external sensors or feedback electronics and provide a concrete example that the proposed principle can be realized in an existing ferromagnet.</p>

            <p>We employ a thermodynamically consistent out-of-equilibrium continuum model to study the motion patterns of partially wetting liquid drops covered by autocatalytically reacting surfactants. When ambient chemostats feed a chemomechanical feedback loop involving a nonlinear reaction network, surface stresses caused by the Marangoni effect and the ensuing hydrodynamic motion, drops show a variety of increasingly complex biomimetic motility modes including shuttling, bipedal, rotational, intermittently chaotic and chaotic motion. We determine the corresponding nonequilibrium phase diagram and show that the complexity of the motion arises from competing length scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Helene Wetter, Jan Wingenbach, Falk Rehberg, Wenlong Gao, Stefan Schumacher, Thomas Zentgraf</p>
            <p>Metasurfaces are a powerful tool for manipulating light using small structures on the nanoscale. In most meta-surfaces, near-field couplings are treated as unfavorable perturbations. Here, we experimentally investigate a structure consisting of sinusoidally modulated silicon waveguides where near-field coupling of local resonances leads to negative coupling, i.e. a negative coupling constant. This gives rise to wave-vector dependent eigenstates of elliptical, linear and circular polarizations. In particular, fully circular polarization states are not only present at a single point in momentum-space (k-space), but along a line. This circular polarization line, as well as a linear polarization line, emanates from a polarization degeneracy at the Dirac point. We experimentally validate the existence of these eigenstates and demonstrate the energy-, polarization- and wave-vector-dependence of this metasurface. By tuning the incident k-vector, certain polarization-energy eigenstates are strongly reflected allowing for uses in angle-tunable polarization filters and light sources.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Protocols Stabilize Charging in Noisy Ising Quantum Batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Grazi, Henrik Johannesson, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani</p>
            <p>Reliable charging protocols are crucial for advancing quantum batteries toward practical use. We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol.</p>

            <h2>Reading Qubits with Sequential Weak Measurements: Limits of Information Extraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesar Lema, Aleix Bou-Comas, Atithi Acharya, Vadim Oganesyan, Anirvan Sengupta</p>
            <p>Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.</p>

            <p>We present a general method for engineering qudits through individually addressable transitions between Zeeman sublevels, achieved by combining a large linear Zeeman shift with a state-dependent light shift. This approach lifts the degeneracy between adjacent states while simultaneously tuning their energy splittings into the radio-frequency (RF) domain, enabling coherent manipulation within the Zeeman manifold using experimentally accessible drive frequencies. As a concrete realization, we investigate the implementation of an $SU(5)$ \emph{quintet} encoded in the Zeeman sublevels of the long-lived $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of neutral $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$ atoms confined in far-detuned, $\sigma^{-}$-polarized optical tweezers. Using realistic experimental parameters, we numerically demonstrate full control of the \emph{quintet} manifold, including initialization into a specific $SU(5)$ basis state via a multi-photon transfer, coherent state- and site-selective single-qudit rotations driven by RF fields, and fast state-selective optical readout. Our simulations predict state-preparation fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ within $\sim 1~\mu \rm{s}$, single-qudit gate fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ with $\pi$-pulse durations of $\sim 2.5~\mu \rm{s}$, and fast destructive imaging with durations below $10~\mu \rm{s}$. These results establish a broadly applicable framework for high-fidelity control of Zeeman sublevel-encoded qudits and highlight the $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ manifold in strontium as a promising platform for scalable qudit-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Di Muccio, Gonçalo Paulo, Lorenzo Iannetti, Adina Sauciuc, Giovanni Maglia, Alberto Giacomello</p>
            <p>Iontronics is a burgeoning paradigm that employs ions in solution as information carriers for sensing and computing, e.g., in neuromorphic devices. The fundamentally different working principle as compared to electronics requires novel approaches and concepts to control the impedance of nanoscale fluidic circuit elements, such as nanopores. For instance, previous research has focused on voltage-induced pore wetting as a means to trigger conduction in nanopores. The present study explores the opposite counter-intuitive mechanism: using voltage to dry hydrophobic nanopores and, therefore, to turn off conduction. This "electrodrying" concept affords exquisite, bidirectional control over the conductance of nanopores additionally showing hysteresis in the current-voltage curve that is the fingerprint of memristors. Using an analytical model and free-energy molecular dynamics simulations, we explain the physical mechanism underlying electrodrying and provide clear design criteria for solid-state and biological nanopores with bidirectional control over conductance. The electrical behaviour of electrodrying nanopores shows two unique features: i) the hysteresis loop is shifted from the origin, accounting for the fifth, previously unreported memristor type and ii) negative differential resistance is observed over a broad voltage range in which the non-conductive state is favoured by electrodrying. These properties are demonstrated in a short-term memory task and in an iontronic oscillator circuit to showcase their potential in neuromorphic applications and iontronic devices. Finally, we validate our predictions through experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores, whose voltage-dependent conductance substantiates the electrodrying concept.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Mohammadi, Mojtaba Tabatabaei, Mehdi Kargarian, Abolhassan Vaezi</p>
            <p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some layered materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Airat Kamaletdinov, Natalia G. Berloff</p>
            <p>We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Praharsh Suryadevara, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani</p>
            <p>The energy landscape picture is a central tool to study many-body systems. In particular, the energy landscapes of glass-forming liquids, jammed packings, constraint satisfaction problems, or neural networks contain a plethora of minima corresponding to competing states. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction of minima originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales, a result that likely extends to a much broader family of problems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-interference-induced pairing in bosonic doped antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Kai Zhang, Jia-Xin Zhang, Ji-Si Xu, Hong-Chen Jiang, Zheng-Yu Weng</p>
            <p>The pairing mechanism in doped antiferromagnets is essential for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the pairing mechanism in bosonic doped antiferromagnets via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model. We discover a pair density wave (PDW) coexists with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping. The pairing is attributed to a hidden many-body Berry phase that introduces the sole ``sign problem'' into this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration to the spin-charge interference pattern. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as the Berry phase is trivialized in the ferromagnetic condensate at larger doping or switched off into the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$. The present pairing mechanism -- distinct from the conventional mechanisms based on Fermi surface instabilities -- may provide a different perspective and new insights for understanding the complex nature of doped Mott insulators and is promising to be probed on qudit-based quantum simulators such as ultracold Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>We introduce an active-space embedding framework for core-level spectroscopies that connects localized atomic multiplets to continuum resonances within a plane-wave DFT/PAW description. The approach is complementary to widely used core-level Bethe--Salpeter implementations based on a two-particle (core-exciton) picture with typically static screening: here a correlated multiplet manifold of the absorber (including the core hole and open-shell configurations) is coherently coupled to a plane-wave photoelectron, enabling a unified treatment of localized multiplet structure and continuum lineshapes. Spectra are computed in a general time-domain formulation equivalent to Fermi's golden rule: a transition operator tailored to the specific spectroscopy technique is applied to the correlated ground state to generate an excited wavepacket, and the corresponding wavepacket autocorrelation function is evaluated without explicit real-time propagation, using Lanczos tridiagonalization or the kernel polynomial method; the spectral intensity follows from its Fourier representation. We validate the method at the Ce \(N_{4,5}\) edges, reproducing in quantitative agreement with experiment both high-\(Q\) multiplet features and the low-\(Q\) giant dipole resonance continuum, including a characteristic low-energy shoulder relevant for robust Ce valence assignments. The implementation is available open-source within the Quantum ESPRESSO XSPECTRA package (xspectruplet mode), together with reproducible inputs and scripts.</p>

            <h2>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</p>

            <p>The functional renormalization group (FRG) approach for spin models relying on a pseudo-fermionic description has proven to be a powerful technique in simulating ground state properties of strongly frustrated magnetic lattices. A drawback of the FRG framework is that it is formulated in the imaginary-time Matsubara formalism and thus only able to access static correlations, a limitation shared with most other many-body approaches. A description of the dynamical properties of magnetic systems is the key to bridging the gap between theory and neutron scattering spectra. We take the decisive step of expanding the scope of pseudo-fermion FRG to the Keldysh formalism, which, while originally developed to address non-equilibrium phenomena, enables a direct calculation of the equilibrium dynamical spin structure factors on generic lattices in arbitrary dimension. We identify the principal features characterizing the low-energy spectra of exemplary zero-, one- and two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models as well as the Kitaev honeycomb model while identifying current limitations of the method that have to be improved upon.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the stochastic dynamics of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal. Using a stochastic dynamical framework (evolution mechanics), we first extract the position-dependent drift vector and diffusion matrix from experimental trajectories, revealing dynamics that go beyond simple diffusion with constant coefficients. We then reconstruct a stochastic potential landscape by applying a periodic constraint and an equilibrium approximation within this framework. The energy differences between local minima in this landscape agree in order of magnitude with prior experimental estimates. Furthermore, analysis of the fit residuals under the equilibrium approximation provides evidence of nonequilibrium dynamics in di-vacancies. This work demonstrates how time-series analysis combined with this theoretical framework can uncover effective energy landscapes and assess detailed-balance violation in defect motion, providing a general approach for studying complex dynamics in confined systems.</p>

            <p>During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</p>

            <p>Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report an ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing us to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.</p>

            <p>Understanding fluctuations of observables across stochastic trajectories is essential for various fields of research, from quantum thermal machines to biological motors. We introduce a framework to analyze the statistics of counting observables in sub-trajectories$-$dubbed as stochastic excursions$-$of processes out of equilibrium. Given a partition of the state space into two sets $A$ and $B$, an excursion is defined as the segment of the trajectory that starts with a transition from $A$ to $B$ and ends upon the first return from $B$ to $A$. Our approach offers analytical expressions for the full distribution of counting observables (such as currents, heat, work, entropy production, and dynamical activity) and the excursion duration, capturing their correlations and finite-time fluctuations. As our main result, we uncover a nontrivial fundamental relation between fluctuations of counting observables at the single-excursion level and the steady state noise obtained from full counting statistics, offering a tool to inspect noise sources. We also show the existence of a fluctuation theorem and a thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the level of individual excursions. We discuss examples from distinct fields in which the excursion framework naturally addresses relevant questions, and explore in more detail how analyzing excursions yields additional insights into the operation of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.</p>

            <p>Prediction of critical temperature $(T_c)$ of a superconductor remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. While the BCS theory explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, there is no framework to predict $T_c$ of unconventional, higher $T_{c}$ superconductors. Quantum Structure Diagrams (QSD) were successful in establishing structure-property relationship for superconductors, quasicrystals, and ferroelectric materials starting from chemical composition. Building on the QSD ideas, we demonstrate that the principal component analysis of superconductivity data uncovers the clustering of various classes of superconductors. We use machine learning analysis and cleaned databases of superconductors to develop predictive models of $T_c$ of a superconductor using its chemical composition. Earlier studies relied on datasets with inconsistencies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, we introduce a data-cleaning workflow to enhance the statistical quality of superconducting databases by eliminating redundancies and resolving inconsistencies. With this improvised database, we apply a supervised machine learning framework and develop a Random Forest model to predict superconductivity and $T_c$ as a function of descriptors motivated from Quantum Structure Diagrams. We demonstrate that this model generalizes effectively in reasonably accurate prediction of $T_{c}$ of compounds outside the database. We further employ our model to systematically screen materials across materials databases as well as various chemically plausible combinations of elements and predict $\mathrm{Tl}_{5}\mathrm{Ba}_{6}\mathrm{Ca}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{9}\mathrm{O}_{29}$ to exhibit superconductivity with a $T_{c}$ $\sim$ 105 K. Being based on the descriptors used in QSD's, our model bypasses structural information and predicts $T_{c}$ merely from the chemical composition.</p>

            <h2>A framework for fluctuating times and counting observables in stochastic excursions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme Fiusa, Pedro E. Harunari, Abhaya S. Hegde, Gabriel T. Landi</p>
            <p>Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases or recurring sets of states. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions$-$a framework to analyze out of equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions and show that it implies a modified thermodynamic uncertainty relation at the excursion level. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Li Zhou, Mauricio Hippert, Nicki Mullins, Jorge Noronha</p>
            <p>We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in open quantum systems where a system with few degrees of freedom is coupled to a large thermal environment.</p>

            <h2>Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darren Pereira, Erich J. Mueller</p>
            <p>We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</p>

            <h2>Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwon Choi, Jae Dong Noh, Heiko Rieger</p>
            <p>Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short- or long-range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that antialign or even interact nonreciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and antiparallel flocking over run-and-chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random nonreciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here, the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. For infinite-range interaction, as soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions, the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random nonreciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium-size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multispecies flocking models with nonrandom but complex nonreciprocal interspecies interactions.</p>

            <h2>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</h2>

            <p>Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Coulomb Blockade in Orbital Resolved Phosphorus Triple-Donor Molecule</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Chakraborty, Pooja Sudha, Hemant Arora, Daniel Moraru, Arup Samanta</p>
            <p>Multi-donor architecture in silicon offers a promising direction towards scalable solid-state qubits and quantum technologies operating at practical conditions. However, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions develops a complex internal electronic configuration with several discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete-correlated states is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards their practical implementations in quantum-technologies. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum Coulomb blockade mediated systematic filling of several electrons into orbital-resolved molecular states within multi-phosphorous-donor molecules accompanied by a correlated decrement in charging energies for higher hybridized orbitals due to expanded Bohr radii and electron delocalization. Corresponding, first-principle density functional theory calculations offer microscopic insight into the orbital configurations, while the rate equation simulations of quantum Coulomb blockade faithfully reproduce the experimental stability diagrams. This comprehensive characterization advances and discusses the role of donor-molecules in silicon in scalable building blocks for quantum technologies operable at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Mittal, Tom Zander, Johannes Lang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengjie Yang, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</p>

            <h2>Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Blumenfeld</p>
            <p>Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low-temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximized in the pseudo-fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also outline an experimental protocol to realize the HAO cycle using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.</p>

            <p>We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</p>

            <h2>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun</p>
            <p>Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranjini Bhattacharya, Souvik Roy</p>
            <p>Harnessing the quantum coherence and tunability of molecular-scale structures, we theoretically explore thermoelectric transport in ring-shaped molecular junctions featuring dimerized hopping integrals. By engineering alternating strong and weak bonds in both staggered and non-staggered configurations, we reveal a marked transmission asymmetry that drives a substantial enhancement in the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. To further steer transport behavior, we introduce controlled aperiodicity via site-energy modulations in unit cell format governed by the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) potential, a quasiperiodic landscape that enables tunable localization-delocalization transitions. This interplay between hopping dimerization and AAH-type disorder gives rise to energy filtering effects and a rich spectrum where extended and critical states coexist, amplifying the Seebeck coefficient while preserving finite electrical conductance. Through a comprehensive non-equilibrium Green's function analysis, we uncover how key device parameters, including disorder strength, dimerization amplitude, and lead-ring connectivity, collectively shape transport characteristics. Notably, asymmetric lead couplings are shown to enhance performance by leveraging quantum interference pathways. Our findings highlight a robust design strategy for optimizing nanoscale thermoelectric functionality, providing actionable insights for experimental realization in molecular electronic platforms.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous formation of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayers (MLs) of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice is fundamental in understanding its complex quantum states. We report a successful top-down liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer process (LPESTP) to create ML VS\textsubscript{2}, undergoing a CDW transition at room temperature. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED), we observed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases in VS\textsubscript{2} at room temperature, and only the 1T phase undergoes CDW transition. We discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1\textsuperscript{o} in ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}. With an increase in the number of layers, the CDW order changes to a commensurate ($2 \times 2\times 1$) superstructure. Using angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy and TEM, we have shown that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V\textsuperscript{3+} ions in multilayer VS\textsubscript{2} and are responsible for the evolution of the CDW superstructure from the incommensurate ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} to the commensurate ($2\times2\times1$) order. We also report the observation of novel Moiré superlattices in twisted bilayer 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} flakes with trapped CDW superstructure of the monolayer. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation performed on ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} show that the observed ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} CDW superstructure has lower energy compared to that of the pristine undistorted ML and the CDW instability is driven by formation of strong soft-phonon modes. Our findings provide an important platform for understanding the evolution of CDW superstructures in 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} with layer numbers and V self-intercalation.</p>

            <p>Research on energy transport has advanced in recent years with the emergence of transient microscopy techniques that allow for imaging of carriers with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this context, transient scattering microscopy (TScM), has emerged as an alternative to traditional techniques. However, the sensitivity of TScM to different carriers can complicate the interpretation of results, highlighting the need to develop models tailored to TScM. Here, TScM is used to visualize exciton transport in bulk TMDCs. We show that exciton populations exhibit non-Gaussian profiles by analyzing the their excess kurtosis. Numerical simulations incorporating anomalous diffusion -- such as Auger recombination and trap states -- reproduce these experimental observations. Furthermore, by tuning the injected carrier density, we demonstrate that the temporal signature of the kurtosis is distinct for Auger-dominated and trap-dominated regimes. Additionally, we find that traditional Gaussian-fitting methods can yield inconsistent results for the extracted diffusivities. As an alternative, we implement a discrete variable calculation which yields robust, consistent diffusivity values. Our results establish kurtosis as a vital diagnostic parameter for identifying anomolous diffusion and demonstrate the necessity of moving beyond Gaussian approximations for accurate analysis of TScM data.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</p>

            <p>Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</p>

            <p>We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n $\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted apatite family.</p>

            <p>Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.</p>

            <p>Emerging granularity in superconducting films by tuning disorder is a well-studied topic, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the orbital magnetic field generates a vortex lattice and contributes to the formation of periodic inhomogeneities. Here, we study superconducting films in the simultaneous presence of disorder and a magnetic field, examining how inhomogeneities in various superconducting correlations evolve under these two perturbations. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under both zero and finite orbital magnetic fields, we report impressive similarities between our theoretical results and the experimental findings. Our results have strong implications for identifying the nature of vortices in disordered superconductors, demonstrating a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson character with increasing disorder, and provide predictive guidance for interpreting STS and current mapping data in complex superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizabeth J. Dresselhaus, Sonja Hellebrand, Rajyasri Roy, Kranthi K. Mandadapu, Sanjay Govindjee</p>
            <p>The tunable mechanical response of knitted fabrics underpins applications ranging from soft robotics and artificial muscles to morphing electromagnetic field sensors. Elasticity in fabrics emerges from the bending of yarn in the knitted structure; however, properties beyond elasticity are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that knitted fabrics subjected to cyclic uniaxial stress exhibit significant hysteresis and the remarkable ability to "remember" their response to previous deformations -- reminiscent of classical return point memory in magnetic systems. The hysteretic behavior deviates from the two standard models of hysteresis that usually apply to solid-state materials, viscoelasticity and plasticity. Thus, we develop a phenomenological extension of the Preisach model of hysteresis which well replicates our data, and discuss implications of these results on the underlying mechanisms of memory in knitted fabrics.</p>

            <h2>Exe.py: Ab initio fine structure parameters for trigonal defect qubits within the E$\otimes$e Jahn-Teller case</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balazs Toth, Adam Gali, Gergo Thiering</p>
            <p>Trigonal solid-state defects are often subjects of spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by the $E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller effect, reflecting strong electron-phonon coupling. These systems, particularly paramagnetic defect qubits in solids are central for quantum technology applications, where accurate knowledge of their fine-structure parameters $-$ shaped by the complex interplay of spin-orbit and electron-phonon interactions $-$ is essential. We introduce the this http URL code part of the jahn-teller-dynamics package, a Python code that implements the first-principles approach of [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021063 (2018)] to accurately compute the spin-orbit-phonon entanglement in trigonal defects utilizing the output from density functional theory calculations (DFT). By employing $\Delta$SCF calculations, the method extends naturally to excited states and predicts fine-structure parameters of zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), including Zeeman shifts under external magnetic fields. The approach is applicable not only to solid-state defects but also to Jahn-Teller active trigonal molecules such as the $X$CH$_3$ family. We demonstrate the capabilities of this http URL through applications to negatively charged Group-IV$-$vacancy (G4V) defects in diamond: SiV$^-$, GeV$^-$, SnV$^-$, PbV$^-$ and the neutral N$_3$V$^0$ defect in diamond, and the CH$_3$O methoxy radical.</p>

            <p>Magnetic flux quantization in units of $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is a defining feature of superconductivity, rooted in the charge-2e nature of Cooper pairs. In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $\Phi_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $\pi$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $\pi$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $\pi$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $\pi$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p>

            <p>The magnetic structure of the novel Hg$_{0.7}$Na$_{0.3}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$, a quadruple manganite perovskite that exhibits a unique $G$-type charge and orbital ordered state distinct to other $A^{2+}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ equivalents ($A$ $=$ Ca, Sr, Cd, Pb), has been solved using powder neutron diffraction and symmetry-motivated analysis. A $G$-type-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn on the $A'$ sites and a `up--up--down--down' AFM moment configuration of Mn spins on the $B$ sites is found to occur. The mechanism for the onset and stabilization of $B$ site `up--up--down--down' AFM order is explored in terms of coupling between structural and magnetic distortions. The results presented here provide evidence of the exotic charge, orbital, electronic and magnetic orderings that quadruple manganite perovskites demonstrate, and further highlighting the distinct chemistry that Hg$^{2+}$ plays in stabilizing novel states compared to other divalent $A$-site cation equivalents.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Pini, Christian H. Johansen, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p>

            <p>We present an experimental and theoretical study of 2-D swarms in which collective behavior emerges from both direct local mechanical coupling between agents and from the exchange and processing of information between agents. Each agent, an air-table drone endowed with internal memory and a binary decision variable, updates its state by integrating a time series of memories of local past collisions. This internal computation transforms the drone swarm into a dynamical information network in which history-dependent feedback drives spontaneous complete spin polarization, pitchfork bifurcated spin collectives, and chaotic switching between collective states. By tuning the depth of memory and the decision algorithm, we uncover a memory-induced phase transition that breaks spin symmetry at the population level. A minimal theoretical model maps these dynamics onto an effective potential landscape sculpted by informational feedback, revealing how temporally correlated computation can replace instantaneous forces as the driver of collective organization, informed by experiments. These results position physically interacting drone swarms as a model system for exploring the physics of informational drone ensembles whose emergent behavior arises from the interplay between physical interaction and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Sharma, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>Sharma and Bhosale [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N>12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers are expected to be vital for exploring complex dynamics in many-body quantum systems. Thus, validating established results on current quantum computers is essential for evaluating their future utility. Hence, we investigate the entanglement entropy of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, in current IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We implement optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol and randomized measurement protocol tailored for IBM quantum computers' limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, we employ quantum multi-programming that parallelizes circuit execution to improve the results obtained by the randomized measurement protocol. Finally, by incorporating the quantum error mitigation techniques into our implementation of the entropy measurement protocols on IBM quantum hardware, we show that the current noisy quantum computer can yield results aligned with theoretical expectations, therefore affirming its capability to explore chaotic quantum dynamics in complex quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</p>

            <p>The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which enables the control of mechanical motion via manipulating polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and explicitly show how two polaritons can be used to simultaneously cool two mechanical modes. The unique advantage of our protocol lies in the fact that the continuous tunability of the polariton frequencies over a wide range allows for the cooling of any two mechanical modes with their frequency difference falling within this range. We further discuss how to extend the theory to cool multiple mechanical modes. The protocol is designed for cooling mechanical motion in various emerging polaromechanical platforms, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems, which is the first step towards quantum states generation in these hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lavoisier Wah, Remmy Zen, Flore K. Kunst</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NNs) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine~(RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems in case of both weak and strong non-Hermiticity.</p>

We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$.</p>

While the normal Poiseuille flow has an associated conductivity which scales as $W^2$, we find a correction which scales as $W^4$ in the case of non-linear flows, where $W$ is the characteristic length of the system. In the Corbino geometry, we analyze the velocity, vorticity and magnetic fields.

            <p>Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Aguiar, M. C. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.</p>

            <p>The scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitters into photonic nanostructures remains a central challenge for quantum photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust and streamlined integration strategy that tackles the long-standing issue of deterministic fabrication on randomly positioned self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), leveraging a buried-stressor-based site-controlled InGaAs QD platform. We show that this deterministic growth approach enables precise spatial alignment with circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators for enhanced emission, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming deterministic lithography techniques. We fabricated a $6\times6$ SCQD-CBG array with 100\% device yield, with 35 devices falling within the radial-offset range where the simulated photon-extraction efficiency (PEE) exceeds 20\%, underscoring the spatial precision and scalability of our fabrication concept. A systematically selected subset of five devices with varying radial displacements reveals clear offset-dependent trends in extraction efficiency, spectral linewidth, and photon indistinguishability, thereby establishing quantitative bounds on spatial alignment tolerances. In the best-aligned QD-CBG device, we achieve a PEE of $(47.1\pm3.8)\%$, a linewidth of $(1.41\pm0.22)$ GHz, a radiative decay lifetime of $(0.80\pm0.02)$~ns, a single-photon purity of $(99.58\pm0.18)\%$, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference visibility of $(81\pm5)\%$ under quasi-resonant excitation at saturation power. We confirm our conceptual understanding of the effect of emitter-position dependent charge-noise fluctuations in terms of a quantum-optical model for the (quantum-)emission properties.</p>

            <p>Topology can imbue lattice systems with special properties, notably the presence of robust eigenstates living at their boundary. Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Rational Design Principles for Na- and Li-ion Carbon Anodes from Interlayer Spacing Control</h2>

            <p>Graphite, the standard commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, is thermodynamically incompatible with Na-ion batteries, leading researchers to search for alternative C-based structures (e.g., hard carbon, expanded graphite). In a simplified picture, the main idea of such search relies on identifying disordered C structures with a large interlayer spacing and distribution of local structural motifs (e.g., pores) with target electrochemical properties. Such exploration is typically done via trial-and-error experimentation, which often does not allow precise understanding of the role of interlayer distance and even Na/Li-ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance. Motivated by this, using density-functional theory and cluster expansion, we establish a structure-property relationship for Li- and Na-intercalation across a range of graphite interlayer spacings and stacking arrangements. We show that Na intercalation becomes thermodynamically possible in large concentrations above 4.21 Å even without a change in interlayer spacing. Conversely, Li intercalation has a narrow optimal window, with maximum capacity (close to the commercial limit) at approximately 3.75 Å, while larger spacings (e.g., 4.58 Å) quickly reduce Li storage capacity. We also find that AA-stacked domains consistently offer stronger ion bonding and higher voltages than AB-stacked domains for both ions. Our results, thus, not only explain the role of metal ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance, but also clarify the fundamental design trade-offs for expanded C anodes, offering practical targets and interlayer distance ranges for the independent optimization of the next generation of negative electrodes for metal-ion batteries.</p>

            <p>In compound semiconductors and insulators, the polar electron-phonon coupling diverges at long range, known as the Fröhlich interaction. Modern first-principles electron-phonon calculations treat the Fröhlich interaction in a semiclassical electrostatic formalism based on density-functional perturbation theory. Here, using many-body $GW$ perturbation theory, we reveal important electron correlation effects in the Fröhlich-type electron-phonon coupling, which are missed by the prevailing approaches. Going beyond the electrostatic treatment, we derive and implement the $GW$ self-energy contribution to the long-range polar electron-phonon coupling, and demonstrate its critical role and nontrivial behaviors in properties such as electron linewidth and polaron formation. Our work establishes the many-body generalization of the Fröhlich interaction that is essential for accurate electron-phonon calculations at the full $GW$ level combined with Wannier interpolation techniques.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</p>

            <p>Perovskite oxides ($AB$O$_3$) have long been central to the advancement of modern condensed matter physics, owing to their rich and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. The quest to understand their various entangled phases has spurred the development of both cutting-edge experimental tools and innovative theoretical frameworks. In recent times, the emergence of high entropy oxides - materials in which five or more elements share a single crystallographic site - has introduced a powerful new paradigm in materials design. Embedding such extreme chemical disorder within the perovskite framework has opened vast opportunities for realizing novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional oxides. This review surveys the rapid advances in the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of the electronic and magnetic properties of compositionally complex perovskite oxides, offering key insights and highlighting promising avenues for future research.</p>

            <p>The compound La1-xSrxMnO3 exhibits a charge order (CO) state at $x\approx 1/8$ and $T<T_{co}$, which recalls the CO state with a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition, $T_c$, observed in all cuprates at this doping value. Local excitations of lattice and magnetic origins measured in the two-dimensional metallic state of La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 reveal the existence of bipolarons of size $4a$ resulting from structural and antiferromagnetic pairings of hole-rich orbital polarons of size $2a$. They are intertwined with hole-poor domains in a disordered state at $T>T_{co}$ which become ordered on a chessboard organized in a 3D-order state of ferromagnetically paired polarons at $T<T_{co}$. Applied to the CuO$_2$ planes of the cuprates of the "214" family, this model produces stripes of bipolarons intertwined with stripes of antiferromagnetically arranged spins, hole-poor, both of size $4a$, leading to a spin density wave with a wave vector $\delta=1/8$, a charge density wave with $q=1/4$, the Yamada laws $\delta(x)=x$ and $T_c\propto \delta$ and a decrease of $T_c$ at x=1/8. This work invokes relevance of a bipolaronic origin of high $T_c$ superconductivity, in which bipolarons of size $4a$ can play a major role.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductor in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate materials represented by La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened new directions in the quest for unconventional superconductivity. A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu</p>
            <p>The magnetoelectric coupling effect serves as a crucial bridge between electrical and magnetic order parameters in condensed matter physics, forming the physical basis for the development of next-generation low-power information storage and sensing technologies. However, material systems exhibiting this effect at room temperature are extremely rare, and the coupling strength is typically very weak, which has long hindered the practical application of such phenomena despite their rich tunability. Here, we break this by reporting a pronounced magnetoelectric phenomenon,the magnetically coupled EO effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials LiNbO3 and LiTaO3. We trace its origin to an unexpected source,the problematic direct current drift,a major reliability issue in photonic integrated circuits. We unambiguously demonstrate that this drift stems not from mobile ions but from defect-bound unpaired electrons, whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of a room-temperature skyrmion states, as directly visualized by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. This collective spin ordering not only solves the decades-old drift problem but also transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an efficiency up to 34 pm/V in LiNbO3 and 15 pm/V in LiTaO3-an orders-of-magnitude enhancement over conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses and even surpassing the materials' intrinsic Pockels coefficients. We also measured the magnetic response of this additional electro-optical effect and found that under the condition of applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T, an electro-optical coefficient adjustment of about 8 pm/V can be achieved (0.008 pm/V/Oe), which is equivalent to 30% of the electro-optical coefficient of LiNbO3 itself.</p>

            <p>Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $\nu=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $\nu=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) diamond has aroused tremendous interest in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, owing to its superior properties and flexible characteristics compared to bulk diamond. Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Thermal Conductivity Collapse in SWCNT Bundles: The Interplay of Symmetry Breaking and Scattering Revealed by Machine-Learning-Driven Quantum Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Tao, Xiaoliang Zhang, Dawei Tang, Shigeo Maruyama, Ya Feng</p>
            <p>We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.</p>

            <p>Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields.</p>

            <p>The interplay between magnetic order, charge dynamics, and crystal field excitations underpins the emergent ground states of rare-earth intermetallics. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we probe this coupling in PrSi, a metallic ferromagnet. The optical response exhibits pronounced Drude-Smith behavior over a broad temperature range, indicating persistent carrier scattering. A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale. At lower temperatures, beyond the scope of CKLM, our experiment reveals that the response is dominated by crystal-field excitations, with sharp transitions at 0.6 THz and 1.54 THz. The mode at 1.54 THz shows a dynamic correlation with the onset of ferromagnetic order, marking the onset of a crystal-field-governed low temperature regime.</p>

A specific model Hamiltonian describing the cycloidal spin structure in a ferromagnetic thin film is constructed, and its dynamics is analyzed using the collective-coordinate approach within the Lagrangian formalism. We demonstrate that the cycloidal spin structure exhibits a unidirectional gliding motion under an AC magnetic field, and an expression for the average velocity is derived as a function of the magnitude, the direction, and the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of micromagnetic simulations and identify two resonance frequencies determined by the eigenenergies of the excitation modes. Furthermore, evaluating spin motive forces induced by the dynamics reveals a substantial DC voltage, which may be exploited in energy-harvesting devices utilizing ambient electromagnetic radiation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Pini, Christian H. Johansen, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</p>

            <p>In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x < 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x >= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x <= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.</p>

            <p>Mean-field theories of the glass transition predict a phase transition to a dynamically arrested state, yet no such transition is observed in experiments or simulations of finite-dimensional systems. We resolve this long-standing discrepancy by incorporating critical dynamical fluctuations into a microscopic mode-coupling framework. We show that these fluctuations round off the mean-field singularity and restore ergodicity at all finite densities (or temperatures) without invoking activated dynamics or facilitation. The resulting effective theory describes the order parameter as a stochastic process with self-induced, annealed disorder, determined self-consistently at the mean-field level. In the $\beta$-relaxation regime it reduces to stochastic beta-relaxation theory, thereby unifying mode-coupling and replica-based approaches beyond mean-field. All parameters of the stochastic $\beta$-relaxation theory are fixed by the static structure, enabling parameter-free predictions that extend mean-field theory into finite dimensions.</p>

            <p>We develop a systematic extension of mode-coupling theory (MCT) that incorporates critical dynamical fluctuations. Starting from a microscopic diagrammatic theory, we identify dominant classes of divergent diagrams near the mode-coupling transition and show that the corresponding asymptotic series dominates the mean-field below an upper critical dimension $d_c=8$. To resum these divergences, we construct a mapping to a stochastic dynamical process in which the order parameter evolves under random spatiotemporal fields. This reformulation provides a controlled, fully dynamical derivation of an effective theory for the $\beta$-relaxation which remarkably coincides with stochastic beta-relaxation theory [T. Rizzo, EPL 106, 56003 (2014)]. All coupling constants of the latter theory are expressed microscopically in terms of the liquid static structure factor and are computed for the paradigmatic hard-sphere system. The analysis demonstrates that fluctuations alone restore ergodicity and replace the putative mean-field transition by a smooth crossover. Our results establish a predictive framework for structural relaxation beyond mean-field.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamical response of quantum materials is central to revealing their microscopic properties, yet access to long-time and large-scale dynamics remains severely limited by rapidly growing computational costs and entanglement, particularly in gapless systems. Here we introduce an autoregressive machine-learning framework that enables the extrapolation of dynamical spin correlations in both time and space beyond the reach of conventional numerical methods. Trained on time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations of the gapless XXZ model, our approach is benchmarked against exact solutions available for this analytically solvable system. Combined with physics-informed spatial extension, multi-layer perceptron model using ReLU activation functions has been shown to be superior than convolutional neural networks and linear regressions for longer time extrapolation. Perturbation study of error accumulation further demonstrates that our autoregressive neural network extrapolations are highly robust to perturbations, suggesting stable and reliable predictions. This work establishes a new paradigm for studying the dynamics of gapless quantum many-body systems, in which machine learning extends and complements the capabilities of state-of-the-art numerical approaches.</p>

            <p>Understanding and predicting thermal transport in disordered materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of periodicity and the complex nature of medium-range structural motifs. In this work, we investigate amorphous graphene and demonstrate that persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique, can serve as a physically interpretable structural descriptor for predicting thermal conductivity. We first show that ridge regression using persistent homology descriptors achieves high prediction accuracy. To gain physical insight into the prediction process, we perform inverse analysis by mapping the regression coefficients back onto the persistence diagrams. This reveals that distorted hexagonal and triangular motifs are strongly correlated with reduced thermal conductivity. A further comparison with the spatial distribution of localized vibrational modes supports the physical interpretation that these motifs suppress thermal transport. Our findings highlight that persistent homology not only enables accurate prediction of physical properties but also uncovers meaningful structure-property relationships in two-dimensional amorphous materials. This approach offers a promising framework for interpretable machine-learning models in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-inspired Chemical Rule for Discovering Topological Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Xu, Rajibul Islam, Ghulam Hussain, Yangming Huang, Xiaoguang Li, Pavlo O. Dral, Arif Ullah, Ming Yang</p>
            <p>Topological materials exhibit unique electronic structures that underpin both fundamental quantum phenomena and next-generation technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Recent machine-learning approaches, such as the heuristic topogivity rule, offer data-driven alternatives by quantifying each element's intrinsic tendency toward topological behavior. Here, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid artificial neural network (QANN) that extends this rule into a quantum-inspired formulation. Within this framework, the QANN maps compositional descriptors to quantum probability amplitudes, naturally introducing pairwise inter-element correlations inaccessible to classical heuristics. The physical validity of these correlations is substantiated by constructing an equivalent complex-valued neural network (CVNN), confirming both the consistency and interpretability of the formulation. Retaining the simplicity of chemical reasoning while embedding quantum-native features, our quantum-inspired rule enables efficient and generalizable topological classification. High-throughput screening combined with first-principles (DFT) validation reveals five previously unreported topological compounds, demonstrating the enhanced predictive power and physical insight afforded by quantum-inspired heuristics.</p>

            <h2>Vertex Model Mechanics Explain the Emergence of Centroidal Voronoi Tiling in Epithelia</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulaimaan Lim, Julien Vermot, Chiu Fan Lee</p>
            <p>Epithelia are confluent cell layers that self-organize into polygonal networks whose geometry encodes their mechanical state. A principal driver is the tunable contractility of the actomyosin cortex, which links cell-junction tension to tissue architecture. Notably, epithelial tilings frequently resemble centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), yet the physical origin of this resemblance has remained unclear. Here, using a minimal vertex model that relates cell shape to a mechanical energy, we show that CVT-like patterns arise naturally in the solid (rigid) regime of tissues. Analytical theory reveals that isotropic strain minimization drives cell centroids toward Voronoi configurations, a result we corroborate with a analytical mean-field formulation of the vertex model. We further demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations -- such as cyclic stretch -- shift tissues into distinct, geometrically disordered CVT states, and that these shifts provide quantitative, image-based readouts of mechanical state. Together, our results identify a mechanical origin for CVT-like organization in epithelia and establish a geometric framework that infers tissue stresses directly from morphology, offering broadly applicable metrics for assessing rigidity and remodeling in living tissues.</p>

            <p>We have measured the quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene samples that were exposed to a cold hydrogen plasma leading to a hydrogenation level of a few percent. Compared to pristine graphene, the Landau level distance significantly decreases in the hydrogenated structures, and its field dependence changes from square root type to linear. From this observation we conclude that the band structure in hydrogenated graphene changes from a linear Dirac-Weyl type dispersion to a quadratic one with an effective electron mass $m_e^* = 0.24~m_e$. This is in good agreement with ab-initio band structure calculations of hydrogen decorated graphene monolayer.</p>

            <p>Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) represent a class of crystalline materials for extreme environments. They can withstand extremely high temperatures but are mechanically difficult to work with due to their inherent brittleness. Mixture compounds, in particular high-entropy mixtures, offer a pathway to tune the physical properties of UHTCs such as their elastic constants. Here we fine-tune the MACE-MPA-0 universal machine-learning potential on rocksalt carbide UHTCs containing group IV-V metals and demonstrate that not only do the elastic constants deviate from the rule of mixtures approximation in the high-entropy limit, but also in the low-entropy limit of binary and ternary mixtures. We find that this is caused by distortion imposed by the lattice mismatch, enabling the tuning of the physical properties of UHTC mixtures in both low- and high-entropy compounds. We identify a three-component mixture compound, HfCVCZrC, as the best balance between synthesizability and toughness, and apply our developed MACE-UHTC model to identify a range of non-equimolar candidate compositions of this compound which may enable the synthesis of a mixture UHTC with a Young's modulus up to 40 GPa below that of ZrC.</p>

            <h2>Scaling laws for stationary Navier-Stokes-Fourier flows and the unreasonable effectiveness of hydrodynamics at the molecular level</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P.I. Hurtado, J.J. del Pozo, P.L. Garrido</p>
            <p>Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of the emergent collective dynamics of vastly different many-body systems, based solely on their symmetries and conservation laws. Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids.</p>

            <p>The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely recognized as a premier model living microswimmer for physicists and biophysicists. However, the interest around C. reinhardtii goes beyond its swimming capabilities. In fact, light can drastically alter its behavior: under blue illumination, the cell attaches to a nearby surface and intermittently glides on it. Such a gliding motility is powered by molecular-motor proteins operating on the cell's cilia, and the related machinery has established the cell as a prime reference for the study of intraciliary-transport mechanisms. This is what we focus on in the present work, by combining in-line holographic microscopy -which leads to unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on the gliding dynamics -and statistical inference. We show that, while gliding, the cells exhibit anomalous-diffusive features, including Lorentzian-like distributions of displacements, which are reminiscent of enhanced search strategies. The latter may be exploited by the cells to facilitate colony formation, or, more broadly, by organisms possessing an intraciliary-transport machinery for the transport of cargo molecules and signaling. Furthermore, gliding trajectories, by being intermittent, are valid candidates to infer forces at the molecular-motor scale that are necessary for the cells to move, or symetrically, to transport cargo molecules. We report a gliding threshold of about 20 pN, compatible with the activity of single molecular motors.</p>

            <h2>Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Schöttner, Qingguang Xie, Gaurav Nath, Jens Harting</p>
            <p>Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</p>

            <h2>Zipfian universality of interaction laws: A statistical-mechanics framework for inverse power scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Baray</p>
            <p>Inverse power-law interaction forms, such as the inverse-square law, recur across a wide range of physical, social, and spatial systems. While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions. We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure. Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms. The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</p>

            <p>The giant magnetoresistance with a huge hysteresis is observed in the organic metal k-(BEDTTTF)2Hg(SCN)2Br at low temperature in a pressure interval around 3 kbar of a width ~1 kbar. The hysteretic magnetoresistance is isotropic with respect to the direction of magnetic field, which excludes the orbital effect of magnetic field as its origin. The observed temperature and magnetic-field dependence of this hysteresis and of its relaxation time indicates the strong influence of spin-glass state on magnetoresistance. Although a quantitative theory of this effect, originating from strong electronic correlations, requires complex numerical calculations, we suggest its explanation and a simple model which qualitatively describes the observed magnetoresistance behavior and shows a strong charge-spin entanglement. The proposed effect suggests a new class of extreme magnetoresistance mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.</p>

            <p>Fluctuations typically destroy long-range order in two-dimensional (2D) systems, posing a fundamental challenge to the existence of exotic states like supersolids, which paradoxically combine solid-like structure with frictionless superfluid flow. While long-predicted, the definitive observation of a 2D supersolid has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here, we report the observation of a supersolid stripe phase in a strongly dipolar quantum gas of erbium atoms confined to 2D. We directly image the periodic density modulation, confirming its global phase coherence through matter-wave interference and demonstrating its phase rigidity relevant to the low-energy Goldstone mode, consistent with numerical calculations. Through collective excitation measurements, we demonstrate the hydrodynamic behavior of the supersolid. This work highlights a novel mechanism for supersolid formation in low dimensions, and opens the door for future research on the intricate interplay between temperature, supersolidity, and dimensionality.</p>

            <p>Low-dimensional metal halide perovskites provide exciting opportunities to fabricate new semiconductor materials. Semiconductor technology relies on electronic heterojunctions, and cost-efficient and flexible approaches to realize functional heterostructures are of fundamental importance. Lateral heterostructures define the energy landscape in the plane of the semiconducting lattice in such 2D materials, representing an ideal platform to tailor energy barriers and to control charge carrier flow. Here, we demonstrate a versatile one-pot synthesis to fabricate a large variety of 2D perovskite heterostructures based on different halides and/or metal cations. Exploiting sequential crystallization of different 2D perovskites, and playing with the composition and injection events of the materials, enables the design of diverse heterostructure architectures including multiple heterojunctions. We obtain crystalline quality of the heterojunctions, multicolor emission, and optical coupling between the different heterostructure regions. We foresee that the design freedom of our method will stimulate the development of novel optoelectronic devices where electronic band engineering is crucial.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p>We develop a unified scaling framework for the end-position distributions of tethered polymers confined in finite cylindrical geometries. Two observables are analysed: the longitudinal distribution P(x), along the confinement axis, and the transverse distribution P(y), perpendicular to the confinement axis. Using exact Fourier-sine and image-method representations with adaptive numerical schemes, we construct and test six scaling strategies for P(x) and five for P(y), encompassing geometric similarity, tether-position sweeps, confinement-strength crossovers, persistence-length effects, boundary-layer scaling near absorbing walls, and tether-centered coil scaling. Quantitative collapse diagnostics such as RMS residuals on common support, modal-energy fractions, and survival probabilities are combined with limiting-regime analysis and direct numerical evaluation to distinguish genuine universality from visually misleading overlap. From these tests we obtain a kappa-based confinement diagram and a two-parameter (kappa, a/L) regime map that link classical theories such as Flory/de Gennes blobs, Odijk deflection segments, and wormlike-chain behaviour within a single spectral picture. Gaussian, multimode, and eigenmode-dominated regimes are identified by explicit thresholds in modal composition and collapse error, providing operational criteria for when Gaussian or single-mode descriptions are valid and when full multimode structure is required. The resulting framework provides a compact, reproducible toolkit for analysing confined-polymer statistics, with applications to simulations and experiments on DNA, chromatin, and other biopolymers where confinement, stiffness, and tethering jointly control spatial organization.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstate Typicality as the Dynamical Bridge to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis: A Derivation from Entropy, Geometry, and Locality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet its physical foundations and minimal underlying assumptions remain actively debated. In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>We introduce theoretical methods for describing the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials patterned at the nanoscale into both arrays of ribbons along a planar surface and spherical particles. Fourier-Floquet decompositions of the electromagnetic fields are used in order to obtain the reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of the nanoribbon array. The spherical particles consist of a vacuum or dielectric core, coated by single 2D material layers. A Mie theory, with boundary conditions modified to accommodate a 2D material at the interface, is applied to theoretically examine these spherical particles. As examples of 2D materials, we consider the excitonic response of hexagonal boron nitride in the ultraviolet, and of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 in the visible. The most important steps and equations for implementing the various methods are provided as a means to an easy introduction to the theory of patterned 2D materials. This renders the article a toolset for investigating the patterning of any 2D material with the intention to tune their optical response and/or introduce hybridization schemes with their excitons. The methods are not restricted to exciton polaritons in 2D semiconductors, but can be applied, by simple replacement of the optical conductivity, to 2D materials exhibiting any polaritonic response.</p>

            <p>Diffusiophoresis (DP) refers to the migration of particles driven by a solute concentration gradient in a liquid. Observations in the case of molecular neutral solutes are rather scarce, due to the low drift velocities in dilute solutions, and the difficulty in distinguishing DP from other phenomena in concentrated solutions. We investigated experimentally DP of dispersed colloids driven by concentration gradients of sucrose in water at relatively high concentrations, $C \simeq 1$ mol L$^{-1}$. More precisely, we designed a microfluidic chip to impose a time-dependent sucrose gradient in dead-end microchannels with minimized parasitic flows. Significant migration of the particles toward the regions of low sucrose concentration has been observed, with velocities up to a few $\mu$m s$^{-1}$. Particle tracking and Raman confocal spectroscopy were used to measure individual trajectories and the unsteady sucrose concentration profile respectively. The latter is correctly described by a diffusion equation, but with an interdiffusion coefficient that significantly depends on $C$ in the range of concentrations investigated. We then showed that a model of DP based on a steric exclusion of sucrose molecules from the particle surface with an exclusion length $R_i = 5 \pm 0.9$ angstrom (close to the characteristic size of the sucrose molecule), accounts for the observed trajectories. Possible sources for the observed scattering of our experimental data are finally discussed: Brownian motion and advection of the particles by bulk flows driven by diffusioosmosis at the channel walls and buoyancy.</p>

            <p>We present a unified quantum field theory for Dirac magnons coupled to emergent gauge fields. At zero temperature, any space- and time-dependent gauge perturbation drives magnons out of equilibrium, generating spin currents and magnon accumulation without conventional thermal or chemical potential gradients. For a honeycomb ferromagnet, we derive closed-form expressions for the induced density and current. In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $\sigma^{xy}=\alpha^2\text{sgn}(m)\hbar/4\pi$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $\alpha$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $\Delta$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aisling Power, Cara-Lena Nies, Stefan Schulz</p>
            <p>Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.</p>

            <p>Low-dimensional magnetic systems based on honeycomb lattices provide a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena that emerge from the intricate interplay of competing spin, orbital, lattice, and dipolar degrees of freedom. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the layered honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet BiCrTeO$_6$ using magnetization, specific heat, muon spin--relaxation ($\mu$SR) spectroscopy, dielectric, pyrocurrent, and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements. Our results reveal an array of intriguing and strongly correlated phenomena, including two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1}\approx16$ K and $T_{\rm N2}\approx11$ K, a pronounced magnetodielectric coupling effect, and ferroelectric order at $T_{\rm N2}$. Consequently, this compound emerges as a new spin-driven multiferroic system. The SXRD analysis reveals a magnetoelastic-coupling-induced structural phase transition at $T_{\rm N2}$, characterized by a symmetry lowering from P$\bar{3}$1c (163) to P31c (159), which likely triggers the onset of ferroelectricity. In addition to its low-temperature multiferroic behavior, the system exhibits dielectric relaxor characteristics at higher temperatures within the paramagnetic region ($T<50$ K), which is intrinsically linked to the antisite disorder of Cr and Te atoms.</p>

            <h2>Probing Pair Density Waves with Twisted Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jefferson Tang, Pavel A. Volkov</p>
            <p>We show that twisted interfaces between superconductors can serve as a phase-sensitive platform for the detection and characterization of pair density waves (PDW). In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, the critical Josephson current of a twisted PDW interface is maximal at a finite field value, determined by the twist angle and the PDW period - an explicit signature of the PDW. The results are robust to variations in junction geometry and can be adapted to certain cases with strong disorder or fluctuations. Their temperature dependence allows to distinguish pure PDW from byproducts of coexistence of superconductivity and charge- or spin- density waves.</p>

            <h2>Gate-Tunable Giant Negative Magnetoresistance in Tellurene Driven by Quantum Geometry</h2>

            <p>Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdot\sigma$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $\Delta R_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-\beta_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $\beta_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.</p>

            <p>We study the large-deviation properties of minimum spanning trees for two ensembles of random graphs with $N$ nodes. First, we consider complete graphs. Second, we study Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs with edge probability $p=c/N$ conditioned to be connected. By using large-deviation Markov chain sampling, we are able to obtain the distribution $P(W)$ of the spanning-tree weight $W$ down to probability densities as small as $10^{-300}$. For the complete graph, we confirm analytical predictions with respect to the expectation value. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For the connected ER graphs, we observe a remarkable change of the distributions at the value of $c=1$, which is the percolation threshold for the original ER ensemble.</p>

            <p>Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p>

            <p>Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Seth, Fay Borhani, Itamar Kimchi</p>
            <p>In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm \pi/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-\gamma}$ with $2<\gamma < 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $\gamma\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $\gamma$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</p>

            <h2>Impact of an electron Wigner crystal on exciton propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Erkensten, Alexey Chernikov, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>The strong Coulomb interaction in 2D materials facilitates the formation of tightly bound excitons and charge-ordered phases of matter. A prominent example is the formation of a crystalline phase from free charges due to mutual Coulomb repulsion, known as the Wigner crystal. While exciton- electron interactions have been used as a sensor for Wigner crystallization, its impact on exciton properties has been poorly understood so far. Here, we show that the weak potential induced by periodically ordered Wigner crystal electrons has a major impact on exciton propagation, albeit having only a minor influence on exciton energy. The effect is tunable with carrier density determining the Wigner crystal confinement and temperature via thermal occupation of higher subbands. Our work provides microscopic insights into the interplay between excitons and charge-ordered states identifying key signatures in exciton transport, and establishes a theoretical framework for understanding exciton propagation in the presence of strong electronic correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Ghadai, Sayantan Majumdar</p>
            <p>Materials driven far from equilibrium can encode memories of past deformations through long-lived structural reorganisations. Such memory effects-reflecting parameters such as deformation direction, magnitude, and duration have been widely explored in soft amorphous solids. Here, we report a Kovacs-like memory effect manifested as a non-monotonic stress relaxation in vitro biopolymer networks formed by collagen, an essential component of the mammalian extracellular matrix. Using shear rheology combined with in-situ optical imaging, we find that this memory effect emerges exclusively in the nonlinear strain-stiffening regime, and persists over a much broader range of strain amplitudes than previously reported for other viscoelastic amorphous materials. Furthermore, we uncover a strong correlation between the memory response and the development of negative normal stresses and associated strain fields, highlighting the unique nonequilibrium mechanics underlying memory formation in biopolymer networks.</p>

            <p>We study the decay of a dense, ultracold sample of weakly bound DyK dimers stored in an optical dipole trap. Our bosonic dimers are composed of the fermionic isotopes $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K, which is of particular interest for experiments related to pairing and superfluidity in fermionic systems with mass imbalance. We have realized dipole traps with near-infrared laser light in four different wavelength regions between 1050 and 2002 nm. We have identified trap-light-induced processes as the overall dominant source of losses, except for wavelengths around 2000 nm, where light-induced losses appeared to be much weaker. In a trap near 1550 nm, we found a plateau of minimal light-induced losses, and by carefully tuning the wavelength, we reached conditions where losses from inelastic collisions between the trapped dimers became observable. For very weakly bound dimers close to the center of a magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the Pauli suppression of collisional losses by about an order of magnitude.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.S. Moskvin, Yu.D. Panov</p>
            <p>The insulator-quasi-metal (bad metal) transition observed in Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth, or yttrium Y) is considered a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of Hubbard's $U-t$ model. However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\pm\delta)-}$ ($0 \le \delta \le 1$) and spin density $(1 \pm \delta)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism.</p>

            <p>We present the sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled Hubbard model on two-dimensional quasicrystals, revealing how specific aperiodic geometries fundamentally dictate quantum criticality. By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($\nu \approx 0.94$, $\beta \approx 0.72$ and $z\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</p>

Using the formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels, we assess the electronic properties of the defects and explore the connection of charge-transition levels with optical-transition levels. Calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission highlight the importance of lattice relaxation for the attribution of defects to luminescence peaks.

            <p>We report results of electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in single crystals of EuSn$_2$As$_2$. In the temperature range of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Eu atoms, $T \leq T_N\approx 24$\,K, the ESR signal splits into two resonance lines, one of which, at high-field (or low-frequency), is the conventional acoustic AFM resonance mode that occurs at temperatures below $T_N$. The lower-field (high-frequency) line, as we have proven here, is the ferromagnetic resonance associated with the presence in the layered AFM crystal of a small amount ($\sim 3\%$) of planar nanodefects with a non-zero ferromagnetic (FM) moment. The existence of ferromagnetic nano-inclusions in the bulk of the antiferromagnetic compound makes EuSn$_2$As$_2$ a peculiar example of a natural magnetic metamaterial. We believe that the planar FM nanodefects are also inherent in other layered AFM compounds, which explains often observed increase in their magnetic susceptibility upon cooling at $T< T_N\rightarrow 0$.</p>

            <p>Understanding how superconductivity competes with other electronic phases in cuprates requires direct access to the hidden non-superconducting low temperature phase, for which Abrikosov vortices provide a unique local probe. We map the doping- and field-dependent evolution of vortex-core states in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ across a broad doping range spanning the Fermi-surface Lifshitz transition. High-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a striking transformation of the vortex-core spectrum from unconventional, pseudogap-like signatures at moderate doping to more BCS-like behavior beyond a critical doping $p^* \approx 0.21$. This crossover aligns with the pseudogap endpoint and the onset of Fermi-surface reconstruction, indicating a direct link between pseudogap physics and vortex electronic structure. Our findings highlight the vortex core as a sensitive local probe of the cuprate ground state.</p>

            <p>We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We successfully synthesized a novel intermetallic compound $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ with the $\rm Fe_{13}Ge_{8}$-type crystal structure. A structural study is presented combining single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis, confirming the presence of two distinct Fe sublattices. $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ exhibits a metallic ferromagnetic state with $T_C \approx \rm 200~K$. This material does not follow the usual $M^2 \propto H/M$ Arrott law, rather a modified Arrott law is obeyed in this material. The critical exponents determined from detailed analysis of modified Arrott plots were found to be $\beta = 0.392$, $\gamma = 1.309$ and $\delta = 4.26$ obtained from the critical isotherm at $ T_{\rm C} =\rm 200~K$. Self-consistency and reliability of the critical exponent analysis were verified by the Widom scaling law and scaling equations. Using the results from renormalization group calculation, the critical behavior of $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ is akin to that of a $d=3, n=3$ ferromagnet in which the magnetic exhange distance is found to decay as $J(r) \approx r^{-4.86}$ with long-range magnetic coupling. The evaluated Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio of $\sim 3$ points to an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state. Low-temperature measurements of resistivity, $p(T)$, and specific heat, $C_P(T)$, reveal a pronounced contribution from electron-magnon scattering.</p>

            <p>Deviations from diffusive heat transport in high thermal conductivity crystalline insulators are generally understood within the framework of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation. However, for low thermal conductivity materials with large primitive cells or strong anharmonicity, the recently developed Wigner Transport Equation is more appropriate as it includes tunnelling between overlapping phonon bands. In this work, via solutions to the Wigner Transport Equation, we develop a scheme to obtain the dynamics of the phonon populations and coherences as a function of an arbitrary heat source. The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input. We predict significant deviations from the bulk thermal conductivity in these materials at length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature, well within the reach of direct observation using current experimental techniques.</p>

Subsequently, we grow MoO3 single crystals with high and uniform enrichment levels of 98Mo and 18O isotopes in several different permutations. As probed by Raman spectroscopy, modest and significant phonon energy redshifts occur following 98Mo and 18O enrichment, respectively. By demonstrating control over both molybdenum and oxygen isotopic fractions, we establish a powerful tool to advance nanophotonics and thermal management goals using MoO3. This work is motivated by the possibility to enhance and engineer lattice vibrational mode phenomena including thermal conduction and hyperbolic phonon polariton (HPhP) dispersion, with particular interest in comparing the effects of light and heavy element enrichment.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry quantifies how the electron wavefunction evolves distinctly from conventional transport theory. In noncentrosymmetric materials, nonreciprocal transport with quantum geometric origin remains prominent with localized charge independent of vanished group velocity. The discovery of such nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses was realized by recent advances in two-dimensional materials. As a promising candidate, the electronic structure and symmetry of layered hybrid perovskites can be deliberately designed and manipulated by incorporating selected organic ligands. Despite the observation of exotic photogalvanic effects and chiral optical effects, the underlying mechanism how these nonlinear responses are enabled in the multi-quantum well structures remained unclear. Here we demonstrated the quantum geometric origin for interlayer spontaneous photocurrent in (PEA)2PbI4. Contrary to assumptions that charge transport across the 2D planes is limited, we observed a spontaneous photocurrent along this crystalline orientation. Theoretical analysis using a tight-binding model identifies shift current as the microscopic origin. This quantum geometric effect is enabled by ionic displacements from centrosymmetric coordinates and enhanced by multiband transition high-density bands of the layered hybrid crystal. We anticipate that such unique low-dimensional systems with structure can provide fertile ground for discovering novel optoelectronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Diffusion-based samplers -- Score Based Diffusions, Bridge Diffusions and Path Integral Diffusions -- match a target at terminal time, but the real leverage comes from choosing the schedule that governs the intermediate-time dynamics. We develop a path-wise schedule -- selection gramework for Harmonic PID with a time-varying stiffness, exploiting Piece-Wise-Constant(PWC) parametrizations and a simple hierarchical refinement. We introduce schedule-sensitive Quality-of-Sampling (QoS) diagnostics. Assuming a Gaussian-Mixture (GM) target, we retain closed-form Green functions' ration and numerically stable, Neural-Network free oracles for predicted-state maps and score. Experiments in 2D show that QoS driven PWC schedules consistently improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, conditioning of the dynamics, and speciation (label-selection) timing at fixed integration budgets.</p>

            <h2>Generative Stochastic Optimal Transport: Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Chertkov (University of Arizona)</p>
            <p>We introduce Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion (GH-PID), a linearly-solvable framework for guided Stochastic Optimal Transport (SOT) with a hard terminal distribution and soft, application-driven path costs. A low-dimensional guidance protocol shapes the trajectory ensemble while preserving analytic structure: the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations remain linear, the optimal score admits an explicit Green-function ratio, and Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) terminal laws yield closed-form expressions. This enables stable sampling and differentiable protocol learning under exact terminal matching. We develop guidance-centric diagnostics -- path cost, centerline adherence, variance flow, and drift effort -- that make GH-PID an interpretable variational ansatz for empirical SOT. Three navigation scenarios illustrated in 2D: (i) Case A: hand-crafted protocols revealing how geometry and stiffness shape lag, curvature effects, and mode evolution; (ii) Case B: single-task protocol learning, where a PWC centerline is optimized to minimize integrated cost; (iii) Case C: multi-expert fusion, in which a commander reconciles competing expert/teacher trajectories and terminal beliefs through an exact product-of-experts law and learns a consensus protocol. Across all settings, GH-PID generates geometry-aware, trust-aware trajectories that satisfy the prescribed terminal distribution while systematically reducing integrated cost.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (this http URL API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery. AGAPI-Agents codebase is available at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Holographic Representation of One-Dimensional Many-Body Quantum States via Isometric Tensor Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Kobayashi, Benjamin Sappler, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>Isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) allow for efficient and accurate simulations of higher-dimensional quantum systems by enforcing an isometric structure. We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary "holographic" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Florido-Llinàs, Álvaro M. Alhambra, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.</p>

            <h2>Anomalies on ALE spaces and phases of gauge theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed M. Anber</p>
            <p>We show that certain 't~Hooft anomalies that evade detection on commonly used closed four-dimensional manifolds become visible when a quantum field theory is placed on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. As a concrete example, we use the Eguchi-Hanson (EH) space, whose defining features are its nontrivial second cohomology generated by the self-intersecting two-sphere and its asymptotic boundary $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which carries torsion and thus furnishes additional cohomological data absent on conventional backgrounds. For a theory with symmetry $G_1\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $\eta$-invariant associated with the $\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries.</p>

            <p>We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.</p>

            <h2>A discontinuous percolation phase transition on the hierarchical lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Bäumler, Tom Hutchcroft</p>
            <p>For long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$ with translation-invariant edge kernel $J$, it is a classical theorem of Aizenman and Newman (1986) that the phase transition is discontinuous when $J(x,y)$ is of order $|x-y|^{-2}$ and that there is no phase transition at all when $J(x,y)=o(|x-y|^{-2})$. We prove a strengthened version of this theorem for the hierarchical lattice, where the relevant threshold is at $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ rather than $|x-y|^{-2}$: There is a continuous phase transition for kernels of larger order, a discontinuous phase transition for kernels of exactly this order, and no phase transition at all for kernels of smaller order. As such, $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ is essentially the \emph{only} kernel that produces a discontinuous phase transition. We also prove a hierarchical analogue of the ``$M^2\beta=1$'' conjecture of Imbrie and Newman (1988), which gives an exact formula for the density of the infinite cluster at the point of discontinuous phase transition and remains open in the Euclidean setting.</p>

            <p>We report on the sympathetic cooling and Coulomb crystallization of xenon highly charged ions (HCIs) with laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions. The HCIs are produced in a compact electron beam ion trap, then charge selected, decelerated, and finally injected into a cryogenic linear Paul trap. There, they are captured into $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Coulomb crystals, and co-crystallized within them, causing dark voids in their fluorescence images. Fine control over the number of trapped ions and HCIs allows us to realize mixed-species crystals with arbitrary ordering patterns. By investigating Xe$^{q+}$--Ca$^+$ strings, we confirm the HCI charge states, measure their lifetime and characterize the mixed-species motional modes. Our system effectively combines the established quantum control toolbox for Ca$^+$ with the rich set of atomic properties of Xe highly charged ions, providing a resourceful platform for optical frequency metrology, searches for signatures of new physics, and quantum information science.</p>

            <p>After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument. In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems. An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</p>

PRAPs was originally developed in the context of crystal structure prediction, in which one calculates convex hulls and predicts low energy metastable and thermodynamically stable structures, but the potentials PRAPs develops are not limited to such applications. PRAPs produces two potentials, one capable of rough estimates of the energies, forces and stresses of almost any chemical structure in the specified compositional space -- the Robust Potential -- and a second potential intended to provide more accurate descriptions of ground state and metastable structures -- the Accurate Potential.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erwin Frey, Henrik Weyer</p>
            <p>Intracellular protein patterns govern essential cellular functions by dynamically redistributing proteins between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, conserving their total numbers. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>Practical quantum computers need to continuously exchange data between classical and quantum subsystems during a computation. Mid-circuit measurements of a qubits state are transferred to the classical electronics layer, and their outcome can inform feedforward operations that close the loop back to the quantum layer. These operations are crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computers, but the quantum-classical loop must be completed before the qubits decohere, presenting a substantial engineering challenge for full-scale systems comprising millions of qubits. Here we perform the first mid-circuit measurements in a system of silicon spin qubits, and show that feedforward operations can be performed without needing to route information to the classical layer. This in-layer approach leverages a backaction-driven control technique that has previously been considered a source of error. We benchmark our in-layer strategy, together with the standard FPGA-enabled approach, and analyse the performance of both methods using gate set tomography. Our results provide the first step towards moving resource-intensive classical processing into the quantum layer, an advance that could solve key engineering challenges, and drastically reduce the power budget of future quantum computers.</p>

We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles.

            <p>Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.</p>

            <p>The excellent structural and piezoresistive properties of continuous carbon fiber make it suitable for both structural and sensing applications. This work studies the use of 3D printed, continuous carbon fiber reinforced beams as self-sensing structures. It is demonstrated how the sensitivity of these carbon fiber strain gauges can be increased irreversibly by means of a pretreatment by ``breaking-in'' the sensors with a large compressive bending load. The increase in the gauge factor is attributed to local progressive fiber failure, due to the combination of the thermal residual stress from the printing process and external loading. The coextrusion of conductive filament around the carbon fibers is demonstrated as a means of improving the reliability, noise and electrical connection of the sensors. A micrograph of the sensor cross section shows that the conductive filament contacts the various carbon fiber bundles. All-in-all, the use of ``breaking-in'' carbon fiber strain gauges in combination with coextrusion of conductive filament hold promises for 3D printed structural sensors with a high sensitivity.</p>

            <p>We present a unitary framework for dissipative quantum dynamics that can be efficiently applied to large-scale Fermi systems. The method introduces local Hermitian operators that emulate frictional forces while strictly preserving the unitarity of time evolution. Unlike approaches based on the Lindblad equation, our formulation scales favorably with system size and can be seamlessly integrated into time-dependent density functional theory frameworks. We demonstrate that energy dissipation arises from the damping of particle currents and pairing-field fluctuations. Furthermore, we develop a variant of the scheme that allows the particle number to vary in time, enabling controlled density scans. The method is generic and versatile, as illustrated by applications to spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases and to nuclear matter in the neutron-star crust. The framework can be naturally extended to include stochastic noise, providing a foundation for studying fluctuation-dissipation dynamics and thermalization in strongly interacting Fermi superfluids.</p>

            <p>Preparing ground states of strongly correlated quantum systems is a central goal in quantum simulation and optimization. The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the entanglement properties in a generalized cluster model under periodic boundary condition. By evaluating the entanglement entropy and the quantum conditional mutual information entropy under three or four subsystem partitions, we identify clear signatures of long-range entanglement. Specifically, when both the system size $N$ and the interaction range $m$ are odd, the system exhibits nonzero four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropies. This non-vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy directly signals the presence of long-range entanglement. In contrast, all other combination of $N$ and $m$ yield vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy. Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \in \text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations. These results demonstrate how the interplay between system size and interaction range governs the emergence of long-range entanglement in one-dimensional spin systems.</p>

We recast entanglement-depth and non-$k$-separability certification as likelihood-based model selection among neural quantum states whose architecture enforces a chosen entanglement constraint. A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix. We validate the method on simulated six- and ten-qubit datasets targeting GHZ, Dicke, and Bell-pair states, and demonstrate robustness for mixed states under local noise. Finally, we discuss lightweight interpretability diagnostics derived from trained parameters that expose coarse entanglement patterns and qubit groupings directly from bitstring statistics.</p>

            <h2>Intense-Laser Nondipole-Induced Symmetry Breaking in Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asger Weeth, Lars Bojer Madsen</p>
            <p>High-harmonic spectroscopy in solids gives insight into the inner workings of solids, such as reconstructing band structures or probing the topological phase of materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly non-linear phenomena and simulations guide interpretation of experimental results. These simulations often rely on the electric dipole approximation, even though the driving fields enter regimes that challenge its accuracy. Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material.</p>

            <h2>Quantum critical dynamics and emergent universality in decoherent digital quantum processors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan Rhyno, Swarnadeep Majumder, Smitha Vishveshwara, Khadijeh Najafi</p>
            <p>Understanding how noise influences nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and the development of practical quantum technologies. While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics.</p>

            <h2>PolySet: Restoring the Statistical Ensemble Nature of Polymers for Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khalid Ferji</p>
            <p>Machine-learning (ML) models in polymer science typically treat a polymer as a single, perfectly defined molecular graph, even though real materials consist of stochastic ensembles of chains with distributed lengths. This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vjosa Blakaj, Matthias C. Caro, Anouar Kouraich, Daniel Malz, Michael M. Wolf</p>
            <p>Gibbs states play a central role in quantum statistical mechanics as the standard description of thermal equilibrium. Traditionally, their use is justified either by a heuristic, a posteriori reasoning, or by derivations based on notions of typicality or passivity. In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the "zeroth law of thermodynamics", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Photon Lasing Phenomena in Quantum Dot-Cavity QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lavakumar Addepalli</p>
            <p>Multi-photon lasing has been realized in systems with strong nonlinear interactions between emitters and cavity modes, where single-photon processes are suppressed. Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication. This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities.</p>

            <h2>Three-qubit entangling gates with simultaneous exchange controls in spin qubit systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel G. Rodriguez, Yun-Pil Shim</p>
            <p>Pairwise exchange couplings have long been the standard mechanism for entangling spin qubits in semiconductor systems. However, implementing quantum circuits based on pairwise exchange gates often requires a lengthy sequence of elementary gate operations. In this work, we present an alternative approach: multi-qubit entangling gate operations that simultaneously drive the exchange couplings between multiple pairs of spin qubits. We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters. Our results show that this multi-qubit strategy significantly reduces the number of required operations, offering a pathway to more efficient, shallower, and more coherent circuits for spin-qubit processors.</p>

            <p>The management of thermal effects in plasmonic nanostructures is frequently viewed as a detrimental waste rather than a useful, controllable entity. We show that optical coupling of plasmonic nanoparticles enables precise spatiotemporal control over nanoscale heating. Through numerical investigation of experimentally-achievable systems from individual nanoparticles and dimers to nanolenses and switchable clusters, we demonstrate how plasmon hybridization and near-field coupling dictate the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature. Our results highlight the critical role of polarization and gap distance in tuning the thermal output of dimers, the ability of a trimer nanolens to focus heat into a sub-diffraction volume, and the pronounced thermal difference in a switchable nanoparticle cluster. This work establishes a framework for designing advanced thermoplasmonic systems where heat is not merely a detriment, but a dynamically controllable element for applications in catalysis, health, or active photonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Integrability of Hamiltonians with Time-Dependent Interaction Strengths and the Renormalization Group Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori</p>
            <p>In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen-Huan Wu</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p>

The core of our approach is the metadynamics algorithm that extracts the polarization dependence of the FES from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without an a priori ansatz. The rest of the FES is derived from the metadynamics trajectories that span the relevant phase space. We demonstrate our approach in the case of lead titanate. The errors across the phase transition, due to DFT numerics, all-atom molecular dynamics, and free energy evaluation by enhanced sampling, can be systematically controlled and are of the order of 1meV/atom. The accuracy of the resulting ab initio FES is only limited by the adopted functional approximation of DFT.</p>

To date, only a few techniques have been developed to experimentally investigate this type of interface at the nanometric scale of solid/liquid interaction. In this study, we probe the interface between a smooth sapphire surface and a semi-diluted polystyrene solution, using neutron reflectivity. A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall. Under flow conditions, we experimentally demonstrate that the depletion layer remains stable, a finding that has been hypothesized but only vaguely confirmed in the literature.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) based super-resolution microscopy in a two-level quantum dot (QD) system. The system consists of a QD interacting with two structured beams, accompanied by chirping and a time delay. The central concept of this work is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy technique. To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.</p>

We derive exact finite-dimensional results and large-dimensional approximations for the DSFF, revealing a scaling relationship that connects the DSFF of eGinUE to that of GinUE and the spectral form factor of GUE. This relation explains the distinct time scales underlying the characteristic \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure across GinUE, GUE, and crossover regimes. Additionally, we refine estimates of dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transition times for different symmetry regimes. We validate our results with Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate applications to paradigmatic quantum-chaotic systems: the crossover Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the crossover Power-law Banded random matrices.

We perform two numerical experiments to demonstrate this effect: (1) the \emph{pulling} experiment, where the ribbon is pulled longitudinally by a point force, and (2) the \emph{bending} experiment, where the ribbon is bent out of plane by a terminally applied point force. We quantify the capacity of the ribbon to work against external loads, and compute its dependence on both the ribbon thickness and the imprinted nematic texture (that is, the distribution of the nematic directors across the ribbon's length). Finally, we compute the efficiency of the activation process. Building on the outcomes of our numerical explorations, we formulate two educated conjectures on how the activation efficiency can in general be improved by acting on both the applied load and the imprinted nematic texture.</p>

These holes and electrons diffuse in the system with the reactions of pair-generation and -recombination occurring between them. The system is driven by imbalanced conditions imposed at two boundaries. The large deviation function encoding the full counting statistics of electric current is numerically calculated using the density matrix renormalization group. The fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the current. Moreover, by comparing the cases where the reactions are turned on or off, it is revealed that the reactions have a damping effect on current fluctuations. This indicates an interesting inequality, suggesting that current fluctuations are upper bounded.</p>

            <p>Ultracold quantum-gas mixtures of fermionic atoms with resonant control of interactions offer a unique test-bed to explore few- and many-body quantum states with unconventional properties. The emergence of such strongly correlated systems, as for instance symmetry-broken superfluids, is usually accompanied by hydrodynamic collective behavior. Thus, experimental progress in this field naturally requires a deep understanding of hydrodynamic regimes. Here, we report on experiments employing a tunable Fermi-Fermi mixture of $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K near quantum degeneracy. We investigate the full spectrum of dipole modes across a Feshbach resonance and characterize the crossover from collisionless to deep hydrodynamic behavior in measurements of frequencies and damping rates. We compare our results with a theoretical model that considers the motion of the mass centers of the two species and we identify the contributions of friction and mean-field interaction. We show that one oscillating mode exists over the whole range of interactions, exhibiting striking changes of frequency and damping in the deep hydrodynamic regime. We observe the second oscillating mode to split into two purely exponential damping modes. One of these exponential modes shows very fast damping, faster than any other relevant timescale, and is largely insensitive against experimental imperfections. It provides an accurate measure for the interspecies drag effect, which generalizes the concept of spin drag explored in other experiments. We characterize the interspecies drag locally in terms of a microscopic friction coefficient and we discuss its unitarity-limited universal behavior on top of the resonance.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking provides a powerful window into the nature of underlying electronic orders. In strongly correlated systems, multiple symmetry-breaking orders can arise simultaneously. and their interplay generates an intricate landscape of quantum phases that has remained a central focus of condensed-matter research. In this work, we report a previously unidentified electronic phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, distinguished by the simultaneous breaking of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetries. Broken rotational symmetry is evidenced through anisotropic transport in angle-resolved measurements, while the onset of both the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect signals the breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. These combined signatures reveal an emergent order consistent with momentum-space condensation, a theoretically anticipated phenomenon realized here experimentally for the first time. This mechanism establishes a natural framework for understanding a broader class of correlated phases known to emerge from the flat bands of two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Multi-Terminal Systems with Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanchao Zhang, Xinzhi Liu, Shanhe Su</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for a multi-terminal system consisting of two conducting terminals and N-2 probe terminals, within the linear response regime under broken time-reversal symmetry. We independently derive exact bounds on the TURs for the steady-state particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.</p>

            <p>We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p>

            <h2>Strain and Interface Effects on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy of MnN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert A. Lawrence, Matt I.J. Probert</p>
            <p>Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the $c/a$ ratio and the MAE was found. A fundamental explanation for this relationship in terms of the underlying point-group symmetry is given, which we show is applicable to all uniaxial magnetic materials. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE. Charge transfer is shown to be the cause of this, and hence similar effects may be expected at any magnetic heterostructure interface.</p>

            <p>Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, reciprocal dissipative couplings can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, hosting pseudospin degree of freedom and featuring helical transport, dubbed as the ``helical pseudospin skin effect". Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized pseudospin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct pseudospin skin effects and their topological transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical pseudospin skin effects. Our findings not only highlight gauge field enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings pseudospin-momentum locking into skin effects.</p>

            <h2>Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingsheng Tian, Rhine Samajdar, Bryce Gadway</p>
            <p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>Van-Hove singularities and competing instabilities in an altermagnetic metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle, Laura Classen</p>
            <p>Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. For both models, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.</p>

            <p>By sidestepping the intractable calculations of many-body wavefunctions, density functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized the prediction of ground states of materials. However, predicting nonlinear responses--critical for next-generation quantum devices--still relies heavily on explicit wavefunctions, limiting computational efficiency. In this letter, using the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals as a representative example, we realize a 1000-fold computational speedup by eliminating the explicit dependence on wavefunctions. Our approach leverages the one-to-one correspondence between free parameters of Weyl fermions and the associated responses to obtain precise wavefunction-free formulations. Applying our methodology, we systematically investigated known Weyl semimetals and revealed that Ta$_3$S$_2$ exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude greater than those observed in TaAs, with potential for an additional order-of-magnitude enhancement under strain. To further demonstrate the generality of our approach, we obtained a wavefunction-free formula for the Berry-curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals. Our work paves the way for substantially more efficient screening and optimization of nonlinear electromagnetic properties in topological quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léo Mangeolle, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</p>

            <p>Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</p>

            <p>Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</p>

            <p>Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Al or Eu and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, leading to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu and Al adlayers leads to the formation of superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$ in nominal Eu/BaBiO$_3$ and Al/BaBiO$_3$ bilayers. Anisotropic magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage signatures of quasi two-dimensional superconductivity are observed. The mechanisms behind quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity and the role of disorder remain to be clarified. These findings highlight the potential for the use of in situ reduction of bismuthate heterostructures as a platform for stabilizing materials with exotic functional properties. Additionally, the strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</p>

In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which reveals the role played by vacuum fluctuations in seeding the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features. These point towards future experimental probes of the late-time nonlinear regime where further analogies can be drawn with reheating, i.e. the thermalization of the post-inflationary Universe.</p>

            <p>Based on the study of a one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a comb lattice, this work identifies an example of spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking in a 1D system with short-range interactions. When a symmetry-preserving relevant perturbation is applied to the system, we find that this model can always be described by the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem. The Shen-Qiu-Tian theorem establishes a direct connection between the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem (in the case of bipartite lattices with unequal numbers of sites in the two sublattices) and the breaking of continuous symmetry. Moreover, although previous studies have suggested that the presence of a tower of states (TOS) serves as an important numerical diagnostic of a system's tendency toward spontaneous symmetry breaking, these investigations have primarily focused on 2D systems. In 1D systems, however, the presence of long-range order does not automatically imply the emergence of a TOS. Here, we observe the existence of a TOS in a 1D realistic ferrimagnetic lattice system with short-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Gustin, Chang Woo Kim, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.</p>

            <p>Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p>

            <p>Controlling charged impurity disorder is a critical challenge for realizing the promise of topological insulator (TI) surfaces in devices. While doping is often used to tune the chemical potential, its impact on the fundamental disorder landscape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this effect in ternary (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST) thin films and their indium-doped (IBST) counterparts. Gate-dependent transport reveals that indium doping increases charged impurity density by an order of magnitude, which in turn reduces the characteristic size of disorder-induced charge puddles from $\sim$91 nm to $\sim$38 nm. This amplified disorder enhances Coulomb scattering and suppresses field-effect mobility, directly demonstrating how doping-induced compensation degrades surface transport. Our work establishes doping as a powerful method to probe the limits of topological protection and underscores that defect suppression, not just compensation, is essential for developing high-performance TI devices.</p>

We treated the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, was employed, and the probability distribution described with the equilibrium temperature was derived. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy, the Rényi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the energy depends on $N$ and $q$. The results provide a basis for describing power-law-like phenomena in the Tsallis statistics. The present formulation is expected to apply to various phenomena, because the harmonic oscillator plays a fundamental role in describing classical and quantum systems.</p>

By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics.

            <p>Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify two segregation-induced disconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration and annihilate with continuous segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections that form stable dipoles, which are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these permanent disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These solute segregation-activated disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures.

            <h2>Dual effect of cholesterol on interfacial water dynamics in lipid membranes: Interplay between membrane packing and hydration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kokoro Shikata, Kento Kasahara, Nozomi Morishita Watanabe, Hiroshi Umakoshi, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi</p>
            <p>Water contained within biological membranes plays a critical role in maintaining the separation between intracellular and extracellular environments and facilitating biochemical processes. Variations in membrane composition and temperature lead to phase state changes in lipid membranes, which in turn influence the structure and dynamics of the associated interfacial water. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on binary membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) mixed with cholesterol (Chol). To elucidate the effects of Chol on interfacial water, we examined the orientation and hydrogen-bonding behavior of water molecules spanning from the membrane interior to the interface. As the Chol concentration increased, a transient slow down in water dynamics was observed in the ripple phase at 303 K. Conversely, at higher Chol concentrations, water dynamics were accelerated relative to pure lipid membranes across all temperatures studied. Specifically, at a Chol concentration of 50%, the hydrogen bond lifetime in DPPC membranes decreased to approximately 0.5-0.7 times that of pure lipid membranes. This nonmonotonic behavior is attributed to the combined effects of membrane packing induced by Chol and a reduced density of lipid molecules in the hydrophilic region, offering key insights for modulating the dynamical properties of interfacial water.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Doppler effect in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Zawiślak, Sandro Stringari, Alessio Recati</p>
            <p>We show that two-component Bose-Einstein condensed mixtures, in presence of a persistent current, exhibit a non trivial Doppler shift of the sound velocities. The peculiarity is due to the inter-species interaction and the possibility of generating a counter-flow persistent current. Analytic predictions are derived by using superfluid hydrodynamics. While the existence of anomalous Doppler shifts at finite temperature has been discussed a long time ago in the case of superfluid Helium-4, an experimental verification of the effect is still missing. For this reason, we also propose a protocol for the measurement of the Doppler shifts, based on the density-density response function. The dynamical protocol is simulated by means of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.</p>

            <h2>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu</p>
            <p>Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</p>

            <p>Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through superoscillations. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiyuan Shi, Youjin Deng, Ming Li</p>
            <p>We study the fractal properties of depth-first search (DFS) paths in critical configurations of statistical physics models, including the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model for various $n$, and bond percolation in dimensions $d = 2$ to $6$. In the $O(n)$ loop model, across both critical and tricritical Potts regimes, the fractal dimension of the DFS path consistently follows $d_{\rm DFS} = 1 + g/8$, where $g$ is the coupling constant in Coulomb gas theory, related to $n$ via $n^2 = 2 + 2 \cos(\pi g/2)$ with $g \in [8/3, 16/3]$. For bond percolation, the DFS path exhibits nontrivial fractal scaling across all studied dimensions. Interestingly, when DFS is applied to the full lattice without any dilution or criticality, the path is still fractal in two dimensions, with a dimension close to $7/4$, but becomes space-filling in higher dimensions. Our results demonstrate that DFS offers a robust and broadly applicable geometric probe for exploring critical phenomena beyond traditional observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ishita Tikader, Muktish Acharyya</p>
            <p>The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The relaxation time was found to depend on the strength of anisotropy.</p>

By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary.

            <h2>Universal properties and dynamical bosonization of strongly interacting one-dimensional anyons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ovidiu I. Patu</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional system of strongly interacting anyons with short-range interactions under external confinement. This system, referred to as $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions with $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations governed by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave fermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the bosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a hallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian with universal power-law tails, $\lim_{k \to \pm \infty} n(k)\sim C/k^2$. We prove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic momentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a phenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality of the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural occupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated natural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple analytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density matrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the natural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify earlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear conceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronounced temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel (TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T < TED to ~ 3 ps at T > TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model within a functional-integral approach. By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</p>

            <p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. R. Moura, L. V. Santos</p>
            <p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We consider stochastic dynamics of a particle on a plane in presence of two noises and a confining parabolic potential - an analog of the experimentally-relevant Brownian Gyrator (BG) model. In contrast to the standard BG model, we suppose here that the time-evolution of the position components is driven not by Gaussian white-noises, but by two statistically-independent dichotomous noises. We calculate analytically the position variances and cross-correlations, as well as the mean angular momentum, which permits us to establish the conditions in which a spontaneous rotational motion of the particle around the origin takes place. We also present a numerical analysis of the mean angular velocity. Lastly, we calculate analytically some marginal position probability density functions revealing a remarkably rich behavior that emerges in such a system of two coupled linear stochastic differential equations. We show that depending on the values of parameters characterizing noises these distributions approach the steady-state forms defined on a finite support, having very unusual shapes, possessing multiple maxima and minima, plateaus and exhibiting a discontinuous behavior.</p>

            <p>Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Using diffusion-based generative structure prediction and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we investigate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key mixed-anion decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and demonstrate that the amorphous counterpart is conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma \approx 0.18$ mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a} \approx 0.40$ eV. This enhancement stems from structural disorder flattening the Li site-energy landscape and a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We propose amorphous mixed-anion Li--P--O--F phases as a promising conducting medium in the SEI, offering a specific target for engineering improved battery interfaces.</p>

            <p>Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.</p>

Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement. Our study showed that cross-alignment of nanowires should lead to a decreasing in the electrical conductivity compared to electrodes with isotropically arranged nanowires. We suppose that the widely used model with zero-width sticks is quite acceptable for systems of cross-aligned nanowires, but overestimates their connectivity in isotropic systems. Thus, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of conducting films with cross-aligned nanowires may be due to a significant difference in the network topology.</p>

            <p>We study an explosive percolation model in which a link is randomly added and neighboring nodes sequentially rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters. In this manner, the rewiring nodes spread outward starting from the initial node closest to the added link. We show that a discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite. This finding implies that adding a link using the information of the cluster sizes attached to a finite set of link candidates (local information) can lead to a discontinuous transition if link rewiring is allowed. This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring.</p>

            <p>Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast electron and phonon dynamics at a buried interface of GaP/Si(001) are investigated at different growth stages of the GaP layer by combining interface-specific photoexcitation and transient reflectivity detection. A discrete electronic state, which dominates the charge carrier dynamics at the interface of a thin low-temperature nucleation layer, is found to be quenched by the following high-temperature overgrowth. A coherent phonon mode localized at the heterointerface is observed for both the thin nucleation layers and the thicker overgrown layers, and their amplitude exhibits the similar resonance behavior to that of the interface electronic transition at the respective growth stages. The optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is nearly isotropic for the nucleation layer but becomes anisotropic after the overgrowth, possibly due to the formation of an intermixing layer. Our observations imply that the 2-THz phonon mode itself is robust against the high-temperature overgrowth, but its amplitude is defined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition that is more sensitively affected by the overgrowth.</p>

            <h2>High-Precision Simulations of the Parity Conserving Directed Percolation Universality Class in 1+1 Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Grassberger</p>
            <p>Next to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP; also called parity conserving branching annihilating random walks, pcBARW) is the second-most important model with an absorbing state transition. Its distinction from ordinary DP is that particle number is conserved modulo 2, which implies that there are two distinct sectors in systems with a finite initial number of particles: Realizations with even and odd particle numbers show different scaling behaviors, and systems in the odd sector cannot die. An intriguing feature of pcDP it is that some of its critical exponents seem to be very simple rational numbers. The most prominent is the one describing the average number of particles (or active sites) in the even sector, which is asymptotically constant. In contrast, the dynamical critical exponent (which is the same in both sectors) seems not close to any simple rational. Finally, the order parameter exponent $\beta$ (which is also the same in both sectors) is, according to the most precise previous simulations, rather close to 1, but incompatible with it. We present high statistics simulations which clarify this situation, and which indicate several other intriguing properties of pcPD clusters. In particular, we find that all exponents which were close to rationals are even closer, and $\beta = 1.000$ with the error in the next digit.</p>

            <h2>Transverse response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic bandstructures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting transverse voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the transverse response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer transverse signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.</p>

            <h2>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Wang, Zhenze Fan, Yan Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyin Song, Ziyue Qi, Chen Fang, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng</p>
            <p>Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Xiong, Yuan Gong, Zhuanxia Li, Ying-Xia Wu, Yan-Xue Cheng, Jiaojiao Chen</p>
            <p>We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.</p>

            <h2>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yuan Chen</p>
            <p>A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way. The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation. In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</p>

            <h2>Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa</p>
            <p>Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Adrian Agreda, Tong Wu, Franck Carcenac, Kevin Vynck, Philippe Lalanne</p>
            <p>Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</p>

            <p>While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their two-dimensional counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least four neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar bipartite entanglement properties can be realized on a square lattice with anisotropic interactions in four different quadrants. The interaction to generate such entanglement is much simpler than the previous constructions by coupling orthogonal arrays of highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with different scalings of entanglement entropy at the critical point and in the lowly entangled phase, and faster decay of the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase. The tensor network representation of the new ground state consists of tensors with lower rank, while preserving a global geometry similar to that of the original networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli</p>
            <p>We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ansätze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.</p>

            <p>We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</p>

            <p>A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. During operation, these materials undergo cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, resulting in complex degradation mechanisms that traditional empirical or purely data-driven models often fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model is more robust than traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. Model interpretability assessed via SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and test temperature are the dominant features, each exhibiting a physically consistent inverse correlation with fatigue life. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that strain amplitude is the primary driver of fatigue degradation in both alloy classes, while irradiation dose and temperature introduce alloy-specific sensitivities. The PINN successfully captured key mechanistic trends, including the comparatively stable irradiation response and dose saturation behaviour of F/M steels, as well as a pronounced reduction in fatigue life at elevated temperatures exceeding the tempering threshold. Overall, the proposed PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable tool for predicting fatigue life in irradiated structural alloys, thereby supporting informed materials selection and performance assessment for advanced nuclear reactor applications.</p>

            <p>Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijin Li</p>
            <p>Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to a few parameters, which are known only at leading order in perturbative expansions. The major challenges come from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and that it is closely related to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of conserved current 3-point correlators using exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep only the first few terms in the subgraph expansions to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative results with the bootstrap data and discuss their application to conductivity near the quantum critical point.</p>

            <h2>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Lenzner, Jörn Bonse</p>
            <p>In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</p>

            <p>As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. As a confluent epithelial layer becomes progressively more jammed, two interpenetrating networks emerge: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells percolating within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of the compression network was found to be susceptible to both specific molecular stimulus and to injury-induced unjamming. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that was well-captured by preferential network theory. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of a network-based inhibition of proliferation (NIP) that is self-organizing and poised in proximity to criticality.</p>

Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</p>

            <h2>Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</h2>

            <p>Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarised excitation, and the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarised illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. The first effect is accompanied by hybridized near fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarisation, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</p>

            <h2>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Calà Lesina</p>
            <p>Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</p>

            <h2>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions surpassing the Bravyi-König bound for achieving the logical gates in the $(n+1)$-th level of Clifford hierarchy in $n$ spatial dimension.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanna Kuznetsova, Francesco Toppan</p>
            <p>We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Xing, Giuliano Chiriacò, Paola Cappellaro, Rosario Fazio, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Wave-Packet Dynamics in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanyan He, Tomoki Ozawa</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.</p>

            <h2>Andreev spin qubits bound to Josephson vortices in spin-orbit coupled planar Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Laubscher, Valla Fatemi, Jay D. Sau</p>
            <p>We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.A. Rodionov, S.G. Timchenko, I.V. Zagorodnev</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate a nonlinear response to a linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic wave incident at an angle on a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system (ES) in the form of an infinite strip. The 2D ES is situated on a dielectric substrate near a perfectly conducting metal electrode (gate). The entire system is subjected to an external perpendicular constant magnetic field. We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it. Surprisingly, the relationship between the photocurrent and the photovoltage in resonance is exactly the same as in the classical Hall effect. The photovoltage is a monotonic function of the magnetic field. However, the photocurrent exhibits a minimum, which occurs at specific wavevector directions.</p>

            <p>The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an unconventional interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Tuning the band filling is known to rapidly suppress long-range CDW order and drive the formation of two superconducting ``domes" upon increasing hole concentration. Here we determine the detailed evolution of charge correlations across this phase diagram and resolve their interplay with the superconducting state. Upon light hole-doping, the suppression of a metastable $2\times 2\times 4$ CDW state coincides with the suppression of superconducting fluctuations present in the parent CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ compound. Continued doping suppresses long-range $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW order, leaving remnant short-range, quasi-1D correlations that persist across the second superconducting dome. These higher temperature charge correlations are seemingly essential to the lower temperature superconducting state, as charge correlations vanish coincident with superconductivity as a function of hole-doping. A multidomain model of short-range V-V dimer formation within the kagome plane is proposed in the second superconducting dome, where rotational and translational symmetry remain locally broken even in the absence of long-range CDW order.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</p>

            <p>A series of Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 samples, CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 with x values of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05, are synthesized using two distinct routes: conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. Comprehensive characterizations are performed on these samples to investigate their superconducting properties. This study examines the effects of Mn substitution at Fe sites in the FeAs layer on the superconducting properties of the CaKFe4As4 (1144) material. The HP-HTS process improves the microstructure and phase purity of the parent sample (x = 0), resulting in an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). In contrast, Mn doping via the CSP method in CaKFe4As4 reduces the sample quality and superconducting performance. Notably, the high-pressure synthesis method leads to an increase in the Tc by 3 to 7 K, particularly at low Mn concentrations. While the critical current density (Jc) of the parent sample (x = 0) shows a significant enhancement under the applied magnetic fields, Jc decreases for Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 bulks. These results demonstrate that high-pressure synthesis is an effective approach to improve the superconducting properties of Mn-doped 1144 compounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Althüser, Ilya M. Eremin, Götz S. Uhrig</p>
            <p>For the BCS theory of superconductivity, the electron-phonon interaction is transformed to an attractive electron-electron interaction in the vicinity of the Fermi energy only. At the same time, its formal derivation using a unitary transformation reveals that the electrons attract one another whenever their energies do not differ more than the phonon energy $\omega_\mathrm{D}$, independent of closeness to the Fermi energy. Consequently, the order parameter becomes finite even away from the Fermi level. Yet, for small interactions, its magnitude is usually small and can be safely ignored, justifying the BCS approximation. Intriguingly, we find that an accumulation of density-of-states at an energy $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$ in proximity to the Fermi energy induces a significant order parameter magnitude around $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$, which exceeds the one at $E_\mathrm{F}$ for moderate coupling strengths. This strong enhancement is heralded by the softening of an additional collective mode, which resembles a second phase transition. We predict measurable signatures in the thermodynamic and spectroscopic response of this unexpected phenomenon, guiding future experimental searches for it.</p>

            <p>Quantum droplets (QDs) in weakly interacting ultracold quantum gases are typically characterized by mean-field theories incorporating Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum fluctuations under simplified zero-range interaction assumptions. However, bridging these models to broader physical regimes like superfluid helium requires precise understanding of short-range interatomic interactions. Here, we investigate how finite-range interactions--next-order corrections to zero-range potentials--significantly alter QDs mechanics. Using a consistent effective theory, we derive an analytical equation of state (EOS) for three-dimensional bosonic mixtures under finite-range interactions at zero temperature. Leveraging the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we demonstrate that interspecies attraction facilitates bosonic pairing across components characterized by the non-perturbative parameter of $\Delta$, leading to nonuniversal LHY terms that encode short-range interaction details while recovering previous universal QDs EOS in the zero-range limit. Extending superfluid hydrodynamic equations for two-component systems, we predict fractional frequency shifts in breathing modes induced by these nonuniversal terms. Experimental observation of these shifts would reveal critical insights into QDs dynamics and interatomic potential characteristics.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets represent a newly identified third class of collinear magnets and have recently emerged as a focal point in condensed matter physics. In this work, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$MoX$_4$ (X = S, Se, Te) and Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, a class of iron-based transition metal chalcogenides, as promising altermagnetic materials. These systems are found to be semiconductors exhibiting spin splitting in their nonrelativistic band structures, indicative of intrinsic altermagnetic ordering. Remarkably, their valence bands feature a pair of valleys at the time-reversal-invariant momenta X and Y points. Unlike conventional valley systems, these valleys are related by crystal symmetries rather than time-reversal symmetry. We investigate valley-dependent physical phenomena in these materials, including Berry curvature and optical circular dichroism, revealing strong valley-contrasting behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of uniaxial strain and show that it effectively lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in pronounced valley polarization. Under hole doping, this strain-induced asymmetry gives rise to a piezomagnetic response. We also explore the generation of anisotropic noncollinear spin currents in these systems, expanding the scope of their spin-related functionalities. Our findings unveil rich valley physics in monolayer Fe$_2$MoX$_4$ (X = S, Se, Te) and Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, highlighting their significant potential for applications in valleytronics, spintronics, and multifunctional nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.</p>

Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizheng Liu, Haochen Wang, Carl Peterson, Chinmoy Nath Saha, Chris G. Van de Walle, Sriram Krishnamoorthy</p>
            <p>This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 m{\Omega}*cm^2 and 12.05 m{\Omega}*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.</p>

            <h2>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sho Araki, Hidenori Fukaya, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi</p>
            <p>We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of Möbius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</p>

            <h2>Capillary Filling Dynamics in Polygonal Tubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Zhao, Yu Huang, Tingxuan Chen, Jiaxuan Li, Jiajia Zhou, Masao Doi</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of capillary filling in tubes of regular polygon cross-section. Using Onsager variational principle, we derive a coupled ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation, which respectively describe time evolution of the bulk flow and the saturation profile of the finger flow. We obtain both numerical solution and self-similar solution to the coupled equations, and the results indicate that the bulk flow and the finger flow both follow the $t^{1/2}$ time-scaling. We show that due to the coupling effect of the finger flow, the prefactor for the bulk flow is smaller than that of the Lucas-Washburn prediction. The reduction effect is more pronounced when the side number $n$ of the regular-polygon is small, while as $n$ increases, the prefactor approaches Lucas-Washburn prediction.</p>

            <h2>Recovering long-range cumulative response to geometric frustration in quasi-1d systems, mediated by constitutive softness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snir Meiri, Efi Efrati</p>
            <p>Cumulative geometric frustration can drive self-limited assembly and morphology selection through size-dependent energetic costs. However, the slenderness of quasi-one-dimensional systems generally suppresses the formation of long-range longitudinal gradients. We show that the suppression of longitudinal gradients can be overcome by tuning the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse (shear) moduli. We demonstrate the recovery of cumulative frustration across distinct quasi-one-dimensional systems, each frustrated through a different mechanism, by the introduction of a soft response mode.</p>

            <h2>Exceptional Alkaline Methanol Electrooxidation on Bi-modified Pt3M Intermetallics: Kinetic Origins and an OH Binding Energy Descriptor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lecheng Liang, Hengyu Li, Shao Ye, Peng Li, Kaiyang Xu, Jinhui Liang, Binwen Zeng, Bo Shen, Taisuke Ozaki, Zhiming Cui</p>
            <p>The exploration of advanced CO-free catalysts and clarifying the ambiguous kinetic origins and governing factors would undoubtedly open up opportunities to overcome the sluggish kinetics of methanol electrooxidation and promote the development of direct methanol fuel cells. Herein, we constructed a family of Bi-modified Pt3M intermetallic catalysts (Bi-Pt3M/C, M=Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, In, Ga, and Sn) that follow CO-free dominated pathway and exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. More significantly, leveraging this platform, we have identified the pivotal factor governing the reaction kinetics in CO-free pathway, namely OH binding energy (OHBE). This arises because the rate-determining step (RDS) encompasses both C-H bond activation and water dissociation, whose respective barriers can be reflected by the OHBE. Accordingly, OHBE can act as an activity descriptor. Specifically, Bi-Pt3In/C stands out from other Bi-Pt3M/C and delivers the unprecedented mass activity of 36.7 A mgPt-1 at peak potential, far exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported to date. Taking Bi-Pt3In/C as a proof of concept, we clearly elucidate the origin of enhanced MOR activity by combining theoretical calculations, kinetic isotope effects, and formaldehyde electrooxidation. Moreover, there exhibits a volcano-type trend between OHBE and the activity of Bi-Pt3M/C. Beyond the discovery of ultrahigh-performance catalysts, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic picture of RDS and offer an innovative design principle for advanced catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring quantum walks in integrated photonic lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Raymond, P. Cathala, M. Morassi, A. Lemaître, F. Raineri, S. Ducci, F. Baboux</p>
            <p>Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.</p>

            <h2>Basis dependence of Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronald Santiago Cortes, Aravindh S. Shankar, Marcello Dalmonte, Roberto Verdel, Nils Niggemann</p>
            <p>Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.</p>

            <h2>Tailored Error Mitigation for Single-Qubit Magnetometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miriam Resch, Dennis Herb, Mirko Rossini, Joachim Ankerhold, Dominik Maile</p>
            <p>Quantum sensing is an emerging field with the potential to outperform classical methods in both precision and spatial resolution. However, the sensitivity of the underlying quantum platform also makes the sensors highly susceptible to their environmental noise. To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $\tau$ to achieve the most accurate results. We demonstrate that our method reaches the best achievable sensitivity in noisy single-NV-center magnetometry. This work marks a further step toward more resilient quantum sensors with the smallest scale of resolution.</p>

            <p>Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) govern non-Hermitian system dynamics through their enriched and sharpened spectral topology, yet the intrinsic topological fragility hinders robust experimental realization. Here, we present a scalable architecture that implements arbitrary-order EPs via a recurrent network comprising a single nanomechanical resonator and unlimited virtual resonators. We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements. Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems.</p>

            <h2>When Is Nanoconfined Water Different From Interfacial Water?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier R. Advincula, Christoph Schran, Angelos Michaelides</p>
            <p>Water behaves very differently at surfaces and under extreme confinement, but the boundary between these two regimes has remained unclear. Despite evidence that interfacial effects persist under sub-nanometre confinement, the molecular-scale behaviour and its evolution with slit width remain unclear. Here, we use machine-learning molecular dynamics with first-principles accuracy to probe water at graphene surfaces across slit widths ranging from the open-interface limit to angstrom-scale confinement. We find that water undergoes a sharp structural transition: when three or more water layers fit between the walls, the structure of the graphene-water interface is effectively indistinguishable from that in an open system, with density layering, hydrogen bonding, and orientational ordering retaining interfacial character. Below this threshold, however, angstrom-scale confinement strongly reorganises the liquid, producing enhanced ordering, a restructured hydrogen-bond network, and modified orientational motifs. These results establish a molecular-level picture that clearly separates interfacial behaviour from genuine nanoconfinement and provide guidance for predicting and controlling the structure of water in nanoscale solid-liquid environments.</p>

            <p>We introduce an unsupervised machine-learning framework that discovers optimally compressed representations of quantum many-body ground states. Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Krylov algorithm using unitary decomposition for exact eigenstates of fermionic systems using quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush Asthana</p>
            <p>Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\Delta t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\Delta t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of the error parameter $\epsilon$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\epsilon \neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\epsilon^2$) vs O($\Delta t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\epsilon$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\epsilon$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion of plasmons in three-dimensional superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Repplinger, S. Klimin, M. Gélédan, J. Tempere, H. Kurkjian</p>
            <p>We study the plasma branch of an homogeneous three-dimensional electron gas in an $s$-wave superconducting state. We focus on the regime where the plasma frequency $\omega_p$ is comparable to the gap $\Delta$, which is experimentally realized in cuprates. Although a sum rule guarantees that the departure of the plasma branch always coincides with the plasma frequency, the dispersion and lifetime of the plasmons is strongly affected by the presence of the pair condensate, especially at energies close to the pair-breaking threshold $2\Delta$. When $\omega_p $ is above $1.7\Delta $, the level repulsion is strong enough to give the plasma branch an anomalous, negative dispersion with a minimum at finite wavelength. At non-zero temperature and at $\omega_p>2\Delta$, we treat in a non-perturbative way the coupling of plasmons to the fermionic excitations, and show that a broadened plasma resonance inside the pair-breaking continuum coexists with an undamped solution in the band gap. This resonance splitting is associated with the presence of multiple poles in the analytic continuation of the propagator of the Cooper pairs.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the mechanical properties of spring networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doron Grossman, Arezki Boudaoud</p>
            <p>The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</p>
