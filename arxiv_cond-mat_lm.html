            <h2>Anomalous valley Hall dynamics of exciton-polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingzhou Chen, Yuanjun Guan, Areg Ghazaryan, Shiran Sun, Lingxiao Yu, Ruitao Lv, Artem Volosniev, Zheng Sun, Jian Wu</p>
            <p>The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined Charge Stripes and Majorana Zero Modes in An Iron-Based Superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Liu, Li-Xuan Wei, Qiang-Jun Cheng, Zhenhua Zhu, Xin-Yu Shi, Cong-Cong Lou, Yong-Wei Wang, Ze-Xian Deng, Ming-Qiang Ren, Dong E. Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Xu-Cun Ma, Jin-Feng Jia, Qi-Kun Xue, Can-Li Song</p>
            <p>In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hall Effect at 0.002T</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander S. Mayorov, Ping Wang, Xiaokai Yue, Biao Wu, Jianhong He, Di Zhang, Fuzhuo Lian, Siqi Jiang, Jiabei Huang, Zihao Wang, Qian Guo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Renjun Du, Rui Wang, Baigeng Wang, Lei Wang, Kostya S. Novoselov, Geliang Yu</p>
            <p>Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Electric-Switchable Chiral Magnons in PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyang Ni, Congzhe Yan, Peiyuan Cui, Zhijun Jiang, Yuanjun Jin, Guoqing Chang</p>
            <p>The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/Å, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.</p>

            <h2>Facile Optimization of Combinatorial Sputtering Processes with Arbitrary Numbers of Components for Targeted Compositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shelby Sutton Fields, Christopher David White, Keith Knipling, Steven Bennett</p>
            <p>Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.</p>

            <h2>Helical Current of Propagating Dirac Electrons and Geometric Coupling to Chiral Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ju Gao, Fang Shen</p>
            <p>We show that a propagating Dirac electron with intrinsic spin generically carries a real--space helical conserved current, even in the absence of orbital angular momentum. Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.</p>

            <h2>Physical and Dielectric Properties of Polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashok Kumar, Simranjot K. Sapra, Ramcharan Meena, Vinod Singh, Anita Dhaka, Rajendra S. Dhaka</p>
            <p>We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($\epsilon$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.</p>

            <h2>Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Hong, Shilin Hu, Ziyue Shen, Chao Deng, Xiaodong Zhang, Lei Wang, Long Wei, Qinghua Zhang, Lingfei Wang, Liang Si, Yulin Gan, Kai Chen, Zhaoliang Liao</p>
            <p>To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Random Walks Across Dimensions: Exploring Simplicial Complexes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Febbe, Duccio Fanelli, Timoteo Carletti</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel operator to describe a random walk process on a simplicial complex. Walkers are allowed to wonder across simplices of various dimensions, bridging nodes to edges, and edges to triangles, via a nested organization that hierarchically extends to higher structures of arbitrary large, but finite, dimension. The asymptotic distribution of the walkers provides a natural ranking to gauge the relative importance of higher order simplices. Optimal search strategies in presence of stochastic teleportation are addressed and the peculiar interplay of noise with higher order structures unraveled.</p>

            <h2>Biexcitons in Ruddlesden-Popper Metal Halides Probed by Nonlinear Coherent Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine A. Koch, Carlos Silva-Acuña, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada</p>
            <p>Excitons and their correlated complexes underpin the rich photophysics of quantum-confined semiconductors. Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Transition in Splitting Probabilities of Quantum Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashant Singh, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>We investigate the splitting probability of a monitored continuous-time quantum walk with two targets and show that, in stark contrast to a classical random walk, it exhibits a nonanalytic, phase-transition-like behavior controlled by the sampling time at the targets. For large systems and sampling times smaller than a critical value $\tau_c = 2\pi/\Delta E$, where $\Delta E$ is the energy bandwidth, the splitting probability is universal and equal to $1/2$, independent of the initial condition and the sampling time. Above the critical sampling, a nonuniversal regime emerges in which the splitting probability deviates from $1/2$ and develops a fluctuating pattern of pronounced peaks and dips dependent on both the sampling time and the initial condition. These results follow from a nontrivial mapping of the splitting problem onto a pair of single-target detection problems enabled by the superposition principle.</p>

            <h2>Langevin equations with non-Gaussian thermal noise: Valid but superfluous</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex V. Plyukhin</p>
            <p>We discuss the statistics of additive thermal (internal) noise in systems governed by the generalized Langevin equation with linear dissipation. To assess the equation's validity, it is common to assume that the system is ergodic and to verify that solutions approach correct equilibrium values at asymptotically long times. In this paper, we instead consider the consistency of the generalized Langevin equation with the Jarzynski equality at finite times and do not assume the system's ergodicity. Specifically, we consider a classical Brownian oscillator whose initial stiffness, or frequency, is perturbed by a rectangular pulse of duration $\tau$. We find that the Jarzynski equality is satisfied unconditionally only up to the seventh order in $\tau$; in higher orders, the Jarzynski equality holds if and only if the noise is Gaussian. These results imply that, unless it is exact, the Langevin equation can only be used to evaluate properties that are linear or quadratic in noise and its derivatives. Such properties are insensitive to the noise statistics, so the Langevin equation with linear dissipation and non-Gaussian noise (though not inconsistent by itself) is superfluous.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniela Moretti, Giuseppe Gonnella, Antonio Suma, Giada Forte, Davide Marenduzzo, Cristian Micheletti</p>
            <p>In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.</p>

            <h2>From many valleys to many topological phases - quantum anomalous Hall effect in IV-VI semiconductor quantum wells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Szymon Majewski, Michał Wierzbicki, Tomasz Dietl</p>
            <p>Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction. The results further indicate that appropriate strain compensation is required to achieve high-quality quantization of the Hall conductance.</p>

            <h2>Charge and spin orders in the t-U-V-J model: a slave-spin-1 approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Simard, Michel Ferrero, Thomas Ayral</p>
            <p>Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.</p>

            <h2>A saturation bound for cumulative responses under local linear relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjeev Kumar Verma</p>
            <p>Saturation of cumulative observables is widely observed in systems with propagating or spreading signals and is commonly modeled using system-specific mechanisms such as scattering statistics, coherence functions, or phenomenological decay laws. This work shows that such saturation follows directly from linear local relaxation alone. Any linear observable accumulated over the lifetime of a relaxing signal is bounded by a scale set by the relaxation time, independent of geometry, dimensionality, or microscopic dynamics. When relaxation is mapped to space through transport or spreading, this temporal bound yields a corresponding spatial saturation scale. A closed-form expression reveals a two-regime behavior: linear growth at short times followed by saturation beyond the relaxation time. The result provides a minimal and unified explanation for cumulative saturation across transport, diffusive, and stochastic systems.</p>

            <h2>Magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir A. Zyuzin</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can induce magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets. Such a current, being a response to the effective magnon vector potential, can be considered as magnon analog of the superconducting supercurrent or the persistent current. Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.</p>

            <h2>Universal non-Gaussian order parameter statistics in 2D superfluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Beregi, En Chang, Erik Rydow, Christopher J. Foot, Shinichi Sunami</p>
            <p>Fluctuations are an intrinsic feature of many-body systems, and their full statistical distributions reveal a wealth of information about the underlying physics. Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric systems offer potential for device applications exploiting coupled states between electric and magnetic properties. Among magnetoelectric materials, \FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures.

Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties.</p>

            <h2>Noise tailoring for error mitigation and for diagnozing digital quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thibault Scoquart, Hugo Perrin, Kyrylo Snizhko</p>
            <p>Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.</p>

            <h2>Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Barthel</p>
            <p>Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian identification of fibrous insulation thermal conductivity towards design of spacecraft thermal protection systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Alberts, Akshay Jacob Thomas, Kamran Daryabeigi, Ilias Bilionis</p>
            <p>The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.</p>

First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.</p>

            <h2>Interaction between cell membranes and protein inclusions in the large-deformation regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaetano Ferraro, Michele Castellana</p>
            <p>Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shizai Chu, Suraj Thapa Magar, John Nichol, Keji Lai</p>
            <p>Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.</p>

            <p>We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control. Our protocol combines the Hayden-Preskill recovery scheme, associated with the black hole information paradox, with quantum teleportation and runs them in parallel and in opposite directions, enabling bidirectional exchange of quantum states through global interactions alone. This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery. We propose an experimental realization using the Dicke model, which can be realized in cavity-QED and trapped-ion platforms, highlighting the utility of holography in designing practical quantum gates.</p>

Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongqi Chen, Chaofeng Xie, Tongtong Zhu, Weiqiang Ding, Yurui Fang</p>
            <p>Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of antiferromagnetic Dimers in Rydberg Atom Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Yuan Kuang, Lin Li, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.</p>

            <h2>Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Vitaly Goryashko, Yury Rakovich, Alexey Y. Nikitin</p>
            <p>Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.</p>

            <p>The maximum work extractable from a quantum system is achieved when the system is driven adiabatically. Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.</p>

            <h2>Partitioning networks into clusters of synchronized nodes via the message-passing algorithm: an unbiased scalable approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimo Ostilli</p>
            <p>Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.</p>

            <p>For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.</p>

In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.</p>

            <p>In combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states, fair sampling of degenerate solutions is essential. However, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with a standard transverse-field mixer induces biases among degenerate states as circuit depth increases. Based on quantum-classical correspondence theory, we propose SBO-QAOA, which employs a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian encoding a Gibbs distribution as its ground state. Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states. These fairness and temperature-targeting properties are preserved even with only four variational parameters under a linear schedule.</p>

            <p>At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.</p>

            <p>Understanding how to analyze highly entangled thermal eigenstates is a central challenge in the study of quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions.</p>

            <h2>Studying energy-resolved transport with wavepacket dynamics on quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melody Lee, Roland C. Farrell</p>
            <p>Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $\zeta(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($\sigma_y > \sigma_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\text{eff}} = u + \sigma_y^2/2 > u_{A}^{\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.</p>

This lower energy scale is accompanied by a correspondingly smaller gate voltage, which means that the strong-field regime is more easily accessible than in the Bernal case. Finally, we show that the interlayer coherence energy is a directly accessible experimental quantity through the position of a power-law divergence in the optical conductivity.</p>

            <p>We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. This scar eigenstate has a form of a thermofield double state for a single-body conserved quantity entering the detailed balance conditions. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable single-layer entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.</p>

While this behavior can be described by a boundary sine gordon (BSG) model derived from electron tunneling, the microscopic motivation for such strong tunneling is unclear. We use an alternative model based on sliding charge density waves and a density inhomogeneity to clarify the BSG description and calculate the conductance over the full range of transmission. Using a perturbative method and a matrix product state calculation, we draw a quantitative connection between the BSG model and the physical quantum Hall system.</p>

            <p>The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</p>

The electron is momentum-incoherent, but not necessarily spin-incoherent; we evaluate threats to spin coherence due to spin-orbit coupling, valley physics, and nuclear spin impurities. We find that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant threat, but momentum-space motional narrowing due to frequent scattering partially protects the electron, resulting in characteristic decoherence lengths ~15 mm for plausible parameters.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits are arguably taking a leading role in driving the ongoing quantum technological revolution. A detailed knowledge of the microscopic fluctuating electromagnetic properties plays an important role in advancing the circuitry design, testing, and material integration of cutting-edge superconducting quantum electronics. Here we report scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensing of local magnetic noise environment of an on- chip superconducting resonator. We find that quasiparticle-induced fluctuating magnetic fields can drive NV spin relaxation, which shows a peak value around the superconducting transition point of niobium at the thermal equilibrium state. External microwave driving at the resonator mode frequency significantly increases the quasiparticle density, leading to enhancement of magnetic noise. We further perform optically detected magnetic resonance measurements to demonstrate quasiparticle magnetic noise mediated off-resonant dipole coupling between the NV center and niobium resonator. Our work reports experimental observation of the Hebel-Slichter peak signature by an external sensor outside of a superconductor. The presented study also highlights the advantages of quantum sensors in investigating miniaturized superconducting devices, providing insights into their future performance improvements.</p>

            <h2>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Di Zhu, Zhigang Wu, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher J. N. Coveney, David P. Tew</p>
            <p>We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</p>

            <p>Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinful model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</p>

            <h2>Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara Palacios, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</p>

            <p>Modern quantum engineering techniques allow for synthesizing quantum systems in exotic lattice geometries, from self-similar fractal networks to negatively curved hyperbolic graphs. We demonstrate that these structures profoundly reshape Bose-Einstein condensation. Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature and enhance condensation fluctuations. In a Sierpiński carpet, quasi-degeneracies in the tight-binding spectrum fragment the condensate. Hyperbolic lattices, on the other hand, exhibit condensation features similar to regular three-dimensional lattices, despite their embedding in only two dimensions: The critical temperature increases as the system grows, and the temperature-dependence of the condensate fraction follows the same power-law as for cubic lattices. We explain these similarities through the similarity of the densities of state at low energies. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. Using a multi-site Gutzwiller approach as well as a simple strong-coupling expansion, for the Sierpiński triangle we find a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Our findings establish lattice geometry as a powerful tuning knob for quantum phase phenomena and pave the way for experimental exploration in photonic waveguide arrays and Rydberg-atom tweezer arrays.</p>

            <h2>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter in Optically Driven Cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsan Huang, Zhiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside them. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new nonequilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal steplike structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that redshifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this steplike potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is redshifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a dirty superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity that includes all cavity modes, we construct the nonequilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</p>

            <p>Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates, self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure. The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum photonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Dipendu Halder, Koustabh Gogoi, B. Tanatar, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Employing a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer-range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state structure. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>In the supercritical fluid (SCF) region, at temperatures and pressures above the critical point, the thermodynamic singularity separating liquids and gases no longer exists. Recent arguments based on thermodynamics and critical scalings have revived the proposal that the SCF constitutes an intermediate state of matter, separated from the liquid and gas by two supercritical boundaries, the $L^\pm$ lines. However, until now, the nature of the supercritical state and the physical signatures of these boundaries have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the SCF is characterized by distinct structural, transport, and dynamical behavior. Specifically, the spatial arrangement of particles-captured by the radial distribution function-as well as the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function in the SCF regime are qualitatively different from those in both the liquid and gas states and exhibit clear physical signatures upon crossing the $L^\pm$ lines. Our theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and are further supported by existing experimental evidence. These results provide a clear physical foundation for a refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, comprising three distinct states-gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid-separated by two crossover boundaries obeying universal scaling laws.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yu Wang, Bao-Zong Wang, Jian-Song Hong, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.</p>

            <p>In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered the dominant factors. Partial chemical substitution, however, inevitably introduces disorder. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened and damped, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show increased electronic localization and a suppression of the nematic $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ band splitting present in the parent compound. We thus propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. Our findings reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a Hund's metal.</p>

            <p>Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p>

            <p>Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations</p>

Here we report simulations of layered interacting elastic lines as a model for the vortex lattice in three-dimensional superconductors, following a cooling protocol that closely mimics the experimental conditions. We show that finite-thickness effects limiting the hyperuniformity range arise both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium.

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p>

            <p>Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.</p>

            <p>The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993, Neural Netw. 6 115), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed study of magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements performed on single crystals of non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$, Au deficiency 18$\%$, a strongly correlated antiferromagnet with Néel temperature T$_N$ = 13.2 K. Field-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a large magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures with an easy axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in which direction a spin-flop transition exhibits strong features in magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity at H$_c$ = 75 kOe. The constructed temperature-field phase diagram connects this transition to the suppression of magnetic order, which evolves from a second-order nature into a first-order transition that bifurcates at the spin-flop into three transitions below 1 K. The smoothed nature of the metamagnetic transitions in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$ is well described by an Ising model with weak quenched disorder, suggesting that the presence of Au vacancies is sufficient to smear the complex metamagnetic behavior and tune the critical behavior of magnetic order.</p>

            <h2>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo</p>
            <p>Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 10, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</p>

            <p>The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been recently extended to describe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.</p>

            <p>Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaaki Nakamura, Masanori Yamanaka</p>
            <p>We derive the condition for the occurrence of the integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems with interactions, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly with redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be systematically controlled by a factor of the system size.</p>

            <h2>Plasmon excitations and their attenuation in dirty superconductors</h2>

            <p>We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with weakly $T$-dependent $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moiré-engineered 2D systems.</p>

            <h2>Topological Interface States and Nonlinear Thermoelectric Performance in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M T Kuo</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.</p>

            <p>Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 8,422 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 30 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $\Phi$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</p>

            <h2>Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolas H. Claussen, Fridtjof Brauns, Boris I. Shraiman</p>
            <p>A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. An explicit coarse-graining study, described in a companion paper, substantiates the results of our continuum analysis. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.</p>

            <p>In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</p>

            <p>The fabrication of functional micro- and nano-electronic devices requires the deposition of high-quality materials of different electronic material classes, such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. To establish ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing as a viable addition to existing fabrication methods requires the combinatorial additive deposition of different electronic material classes. However, current techniques do not provide such a capability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet confined electroplating, an ultra-high-resolution AM technique initially developed for metals as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), allows not only the direct deposition of many metals, but also of metal-oxides. Particularly, we demonstrate that applying fundamental electrochemical principles in combination with on-the-fly switching of the deposited material allows for the direct co-deposition of metals, metal-hydroxides and -oxides. Our results exemplify the feasibility of leveraging simple water-based electrochemical concepts to produce intricate and multi-material structures at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures.

After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vipul Upadhyay, Amikam Levy</p>
            <p>A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.</p>

We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations.

We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</p>

This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p>

For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G.S., Siddhartha Das</p>
            <p>We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofiia Chorna, Davide Tisi, Cesare Malosso, Wei Bin How, Michele Ceriotti, Sanggyu Chong</p>
            <p>The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</p>

            <h2>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Tronci</p>
            <p>We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current. This distinction between force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the correlation-induced quantum torques and the current shift in the spin Hall effect. This Hall shift leads to a new definition of the transport spin current thereby addressing an open question in spintronics. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the CI-NEB with the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench benchmark set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction in energy and force calculations of 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. These results establish this hybrid method as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</p>

            <h2>Photoluminescence Dynamics of CdSe QD/polymer Langmuir-Blodgett Thin Films: Morphology Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Martín-García, Pedro M. R. Paulo, Sílvia M. B. Costa, M. Mercedes Velázquez</p>
            <p>Thin films of colloidal semiconductor CdSe quantum-dots (QDs) and a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer were prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and their photoluminescence was characterized by confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy. In the films, the photoluminescence dynamics are strongly affected by excitation energy migration between close-packed quantum-dots and energy trapping by surface-defective QDs or small clusters of aggregated QDs. Polymer/QD films with more aggregated QD regions exhibit lower PL intensities and faster decays, which we attribute primarily to the increased ability of excitations to find trap sites among more close-packed QD regions. This was confirmed by comparing films from bilayer or co-spreading deposition, and varying the QD-to-polymer composition or the surface pressure at deposition. The more regular films, such as those obtained by bilayer deposition at high-pressure, display more surface emission intensity and decays with less accentuated curvature. Decay analysis was performed with a model that accounts for excitation energy migration and trapping in the films. In the framework of the model, the photoluminescence dynamics are related to film morphology through the density of energy traps. A lower amount of QD clustering in the films reflects on a lower density of energy traps and, thus, on more emissive QD films, as inferred here for bilayer films relatively to co-spreading films.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianhong Lu, Luiz H. Santos</p>
            <p>Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moiré TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal supercurrents in Josephson junctions have recently emerged as a sensitive tool for investigating broken symmetries in superconducting quantum materials. Here, we report an even-odd Josephson diode effect (JDE) in Corbino-geometry junctions fabricated on the pristine surface of a bulk-insulating three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI). We find that the diode polarity, which indicates the preferred direction of supercurrent flow, robustly alternates its sign depending on the parity (even or odd) of the enclosed vortex number. This behavior is absent in two key control devices: a non-topological graphene Corbino Josephson junction and a 3DTI-based linear Josephson junction. These results indicate that the polarity-tunable JDE is intrinsically linked to the unique combination of the proximitized topological superconductivity in the 3DTI surface and the Corbino device's closed-loop geometry. Our theoretical modeling attributes the observed sign change in diode polarity to the alternating sign of periodic boundary conditions in topological superconductors, supporting the interpretation that the vortex-parity-controlled JDE is a direct manifestation of the underlying Andreev bound state topology associated with the presence of non-Abelian anyons in the vortices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Jonas B. Profe, Ying Li, Roser Valentí</p>
            <p>CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly identified strongly correlated kagome superconductor, characterized by non-Fermi-liquid behavior at elevated temperatures and intertwined charge- and spin-density-wave order below $T_{DW}\approx 54$K. Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization. This, in turn, strongly suggests that superconductivity emerges as a direct consequence of the suppression of the system's ordered phase.</p>

            <p>We compare two complementary theoretical approaches to compute and interpret Floquet sidebands in periodically driven quantum materials: a first-order perturbative approach (first-order perturbative Born approximation, PB1) and time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (tdNEGF). Using graphene as a model Dirac system, we disentangle in pump-probe setups Floquet-dressed initial states, Volkov-dressed final states (also known as laser-assisted photoelectric effect, LAPE), and their interference. We quantify how photoemission matrix elements, polarization, incidence angle, and near-surface screening shape the momentum-resolved sideband intensity observed in tr-ARPES. PB1 yields an analytical expression for the momentum-dependent sideband intensity, and for graphene it captures the correct symmetry trends, such as the magnitude of the intensities when considering the interference between the Floquet and Volkov states and photoemission matrix elements. tdNEGF reproduces the full energy-momentum-resolved spectra, including hybridization gaps and spectral-weight redistribution. We find qualitative agreement between PB1 and tdNEGF once matrix elements are included; quantitative differences arise near hybridization regions and at specific angles where higher-order processes and self-energies are essential. Thus, for systems with simple band structures and away from these regions, the two approaches can be used in a complementary way.</p>

            <p>Atomically sharp 2D in-plane heterostructures with nanoscale interfaces provide a powerful platform for tailoring optical and electrical properties at the nanoscale, enabling novel device engineering and the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, direct experimental correlation between local dielectric response and excitonic properties across such interfaces has remained elusive. Here, we probed the nanoscale complex dielectric function and the corresponding localized photoluminescence (PL) modulations in heterostructure domains of lateral monolayer MoxW1-xS2 - WxMo1-xS2, synthesized using a liquid-phase precursor-assisted approach. Near-field nano imaging across the visible-near-infrared range enables real space mapping of sharp amplitude and phase changes at the heterointerface, resolving the local complex dielectric function with nano-meter scale spatial resolution. Excitation energy-dependent nano spectroscopy reveals a reversal of dielectric contrast between Mo-rich and W-rich domains at their respective excitonic resonances, consistent with Lorentz-oscillator fits. Complementary hyperspectral nano-PL mapping resolves the evolution of excitonic emission across the lateral heterointerface, with neutral-exciton intensities varying continuously from W-rich to Mo-rich regions. Effective-medium theory modeling of the imaginary part of the effective dielectric function of the heterostructure as a function of photon energy and Mo filling fraction reproduces the observed excitonic trends, linking the PL evolution to a composition-dependent dielectric response. Together, these results provide direct nanoscale correlation between dielectric and excitonic boundaries in laterally stitched monolayer heterostructures and establish a multimodal near-field spectroscopy framework for probing excitonic phenomena at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic field induced phenomena in Kitaev spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Feng, Nandini Trivedi</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.</p>

            <p>Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.</p>

            <p>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with $s$-wave superconducting tips has been widely applied to probe exotic superconductors, but its potential for investigating topological superconductors remains unclear. In junctions between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor, the dominant tunneling process is Andreev reflection, in which Cooper pairs from the $s$-wave superconductor tunnel as particle--hole excitations into the surface state of the topological superconductor. In this work, we theoretically investigate the fundamental properties of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy on topological superconductors, focusing on the $dI/dV$ characteristics and current noise. We develop a real-time description of an effective tunneling action incorporating Andreev reflection processes in the Keldysh formalism and derive analytical expressions for the Andreev reflection current and the associated current noise. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations for representative topological superconductors and provide a catalog of $dI/dV$ spectra and the Fano factor. Our results establish guidelines for probing topological superconductivity using STM with $s$-wave superconducting tips, and provide theoretical benchmarks for future STS experiments.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state.

            <p>The electronic ground states of transition-metal dichalcogenides are strongly shaped by reduced dimensionality, yet the properties of atomically thin layers remain difficult to probe due to their small size and environmental sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that controlled electrochemical intercalation of organic cations provides a robust bulk platform for accessing monolayer-like physics in NbSe$_2$. Intercalation of tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium expands the interlayer spacing by nearly a factor of two, electronically decoupling the NbSe$_2$ layers while simultaneously introducing well-defined charge doping. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoemission, we uncover a pronounced enhancement of the charge-density-wave transition temperature to $\sim 130$ K together with a strong suppression of superconductivity, reproducing the phase diagram observed in exfoliated monolayers. The enhanced charge-density-wave order and reduced $T_c$ arise from the combined effects of dimensionality reduction and electron injection, and are accompanied by distinct dip-hump anomalies in the tunneling spectra suggestive of collective mode excitations. Our results establish molecular intercalation as a powerful and scalable route for engineering competing orders in layered quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.</p>

            <p>Spin fluctuations have been generally believed as the pairing glue of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies have revealed a weak flat spin-fluctuation signal around 45 meV in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, suggesting strong interlayer and weak intralayer magnetic couplings ($SJ_{\perp}\approx$ 60 meV, $SJ_{\parallel}\leq$ 3.5 meV) in contrast to cuprate and pnictide superconductors. Here, we report further INS studies on the Pr and Nd doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ powder samples at ambient pressure. Besides the crystalline electric field excitations at low energies, we have found that the 45 meV flat mode splits into two modes in doped compounds, along with another weak mode at about 60 meV, where the spin fluctuations in La$_2$NdNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ are stronger than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Based on an effective Heisenberg model by only considering the nearest-neighbor exchange couplings on the stripe-type antiferromagnetic orders, we conclude that the interlayer coupling $SJ_{\perp}$ is enhanced to about 69 meV and 73 meV for Pr and Nd doped samples, respectively.

            <h2>Energy-efficient time series processing in real-time with fluidic iontronic memristor circuits</h2>

            <p>Iontronic neuromorphic computing has emerged as a rapidly expanding paradigm. The arrival of angstrom-confined iontronic devices enables ultra-low power consumption with dynamics and memory timescales that intrinsically align well with signals of natural origin, a challenging combination for conventional (solid-state) neuromorphic materials. However, comparisons to earlier conventional substrates and evaluations of concrete application domains remain a challenge for iontronics. Here we propose a pathway toward iontronic circuits that can address established time series benchmark tasks, enabling performance comparisons and highlighting possible application domains for efficient real-time time series processing. We model a Kirchhoff-governed circuit with iontronic memristors as edges, while the dynamic internal voltages serve as output vector for a linear readout function, during which energy consumption is also logged. All these aspects are integrated into the open-source pyontronics package. Without requiring input encoding or virtual timing mechanisms, our simulations demonstrate prediction performance comparable to various earlier solid-state reservoirs, notably with an exceptionally low energy consumption of over 5 orders of magnitude lower. These results suggest a pathway of iontronic technologies for ultra-low-power real-time neuromorphic computation.</p>

            <h2>A General Theory of Chiral Splitting of Magnons in Two-Dimensional Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Xie, Dinghui Wang, Chao Li, Xiaofan Shen, Junting Zhang</p>
            <p>Magnons in antiferromagnets exhibit two chiral modes, providing an intrinsic degree of freedom for magnon-based computing architectures and spintronic devices. Electrical control of chiral splitting is crucial for applications, but remains challenging. Here, we propose the concept of extrinsic chiral splitting, involving alternating and ferrimagnet-like types, which can be induced and controlled by an electric field. A symmetry framework based on 464 collinear spin layer groups is established to classify chiral splitting characteristics and electric field responses in two-dimensional magnets. We further elucidate how the spin layer group determines the type of alternating chiral splitting and the dominant lowest-order magnetic exchange interaction. We demonstrate electric-field control over the magnitude and sign of the chiral splitting, enabling control of the spin Seebeck and Nernst effects related to thermal spin transport. This work provides a general theory for electric field manipulation of magnon chirality, paving the way for low-power magnonic logic devices.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical relationship between the macro-texture and micro-structure in dairy processing revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erika Nozawa</p>
            <p>The theoretical relationship between the macroscopic textural quality and microscopic structural quality appearing in the phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter is revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice (CML) based on the mesoscopic elementary processes of the emulsion interfaces. Using the Young-Laplace equation, we derive the microscopic particle quantities of the size and density of air bubbles and butter grains in an emulsion from the macroscopic rheological quantities of the overrun and viscosity of the emulsion. In doing so, we focus on the size determined by the "tug-of-war" between air bubbles and butter grains via their cohesion pressures, and on the density determined by the "costume change" of the emulsion molecular complexes (clad particles, e.g., butter grain-clad air bubbles) to their suitable size. Using the obtained microscopic particle quantities, we now propose a microscopic state diagram, the size-density plane, in addition to the previously proposed macroscopic state diagram, the viscosity-overrun plane. These state diagrams reveal that while the two well-known different phase inversion processes at high and low whipping temperatures appear as the two parallel processes of viscosity dominance and overrun dominance in the viscosity-overrun plane, they appear as the two orthogonal processes of isodensity/size dominance and isosize/density dominance in the size-density plane. This theoretical simulation result is significant for the quality design of butter because it demonstrates that differences in macroscopic textural quality can be easily controlled by differences in microscopic structural quality.</p>

            <h2>Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling Is Insufficient to Generate Significant CISS in Two-Terminal Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vipul Upadhyay, Amikam Levy</p>
            <p>A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.</p>

In the static limit we show that it can be written in terms of universal functions which, at zero temperature, coincide with the level spacing distribution function of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble.

            <p>Colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) have emerged as a cornerstone of next-generation optoelectronics, offering unparalleled spectral tunability and solution-processability. However, the transition from laboratory-scale devices to sustainable industrial manufacturing is fundamentally hindered by spin-coating workflows, which are intrinsically wasteful and restricted to planar geometries. These limitations are particularly acute for high-performance cQDs containing regulated elements such as lead, cadmium, or mercury, where poor material utilization exacerbates both environmental burden and cost. Here we report a biphasic dip-coating strategy that redefines the material efficiency of nanocrystal film fabrication. By utilizing an immiscible underlayer to displace ~88% of the active reservoir volume, we demonstrate a deposition geometry that decouples material consumption from total precursor volume. Infrared PbS photodetectors fabricated via this approach maintain their performance against spin-coated benchmarks while reducing ink consumption by up to 20-fold. Our technoeconomic analysis reveals that this biphasic architecture achieves cost parity at film thicknesses an order of magnitude lower than conventional monophasic dip-coating. Our results establish a low-waste framework for solution-processed materials, providing a viable pathway for the resource-efficient manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Increasing the stability of a superfluid in a rotating necklace potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulio Nesti, Luca Pezzè</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have probed the stability of ring superfluids in the presence of Josephson barriers or Gaussian impurities. Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $\omega$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $\omega_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $\omega_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Dai, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Kyung Chae, Woo-Sik Son, Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.</p>

            <p>The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.</p>

            <h2>On the testing of grain shape corrections to bedload transport equations with grain-resolved numerical simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yulan Chen, Orencio Durán, Thomas Pähtz</p>
            <p>Using grain-resolved LES-DEM simulations, Zhang et al. (J. Geophys. Res. Earth Surf. 130, e2024JF007937, 2025) aimed to validate a grain-shape-corrected bedload transport equation proposed earlier by the same group. It states that grain shape effects are captured through a modified Shields number that depends, among others, on the drag coefficient, $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$, determined from the force balance for a grain settling in a fluid at rest. To independently vary $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ in their simulations, the authors changed the boundary conditions on the grains' surfaces: By artificially shifting the locations of the no-slip conditions from the actual grain surface to a virtual surface a distance $l$ into the grain interior, they hoped to well approximate Navier-slip conditions with a slip length $l$. Here, we argue that this approximation is appropriate only if the thickness of the boundary layer that forms around the virtual surface is much larger than $l$, which we demonstrate was not the case for the authors' simulations. In particular, using independent DNS-DEM grain settling simulations for the same hydrodynamic conditions, we directly show that this approximation substantially overestimates the value of $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ of a Navier-slip sphere. This implies that the conditions created with their artificial method do not correspond to physically realistic scenarios and therefore do not support the authors' grain shape correction. To support this conclusion, we demonstrate that their entire numerical data can be alternatively explained by a simple null hypothesis model, without grain shape correction, based on the virtual-grain rather than the actual-grain size.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.</p>

Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.</p>

            <p>Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.</p>

            <p>For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Ren Zhou, Zheng-Cheng Gu</p>
            <p>The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</p>

            <p>Laminated safety glass (LSG) is a composite assembly of glass and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a viscoelastic polymer. LSG can be found in building facades, important landmarks around the world, and every major form of transportation. Yet, the assembly suffers from unwanted bubbles which are anathema to one of the most important features of glass: optical transparency. In here, we present an in-depth study of the reasons behind these bubbles, either during high-temperature quality control tests or normal glass operating conditions. We provide a physical model for bubble growth that deals with two gases, thermal effects on gas solubility and diffusivity, and a time-temperature dependent rheology. The model can be extended to n-component bubbles or other materials beyond PVB. By combining experiments and theory, we show that two gases are at play: air trapped in interfacial bubbles in the assembly during lamination and water initially dissolved in the polymer bulk. Both gases work in tandem to induce bubble growth in finished assemblies of LSG provided that (i) the original bubble nucleus has a critical size and (ii) the polymer relaxes (softens) sufficiently enough, especially at elevated temperatures. The latter constraints are relaxed in a condition we termed anomalous air oversaturation that may even trigger a catastrophic, yet beautiful ice flower instability.</p>

            <p>The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2. These results offer a microscopic explanation for the anomalously low thermal conductivity widely observed in transition-metal dichalcogenides and demonstrate how atomic-scale disorder dictates energy flow in two-dimensional materials.</p>

We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses.

We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.</p>

            <h2>Linked skyrmions in shifted magnetic bilayer</h2>

            <p>Magnetic solitons have recently attracted significant attention due to their intricate physical properties and potential applications in information processing. The majority of the studies in this field, however, are focused on a particular type of solitons known as skyrmions, characterised by a unit topological charge. Here, we present a shifted magnetic bilayer that can demonstrate magnetic solitons with arbitrary large topological charges. These configurations, which we call linked skyrmions, consist of multiple skyrmions linked together with topological point defects. These topological point defects, termed as anti-aligned points, originate from the mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in two different layers. By tuning the interlayer exchange coupling and the external magnetic field, one can also achieve different ground states in this bilayer. Additionally, the system also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be realised. Our findings, thus, can provide a way to achieve solitons with large topological charge and realise them in realistic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra J. Hardy, Samuel Cameron, Steven McDonald, Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Serrano Richaud, Sylvain Latil, Lorenzo Sponza</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. It is known that the gapwidth of these heterostructures can be classified into three families depending on the width of the graphene part. Here, by employing ab initio methods (standard and time-dependent density functional theory and GW), we demonstrate that such classification still holds for other electronic states close to the gap. We show that they display trends substantially different from those known for the gapwidth and originate family-specific features in the screening properties and optical absorption spectra (peak energy and intensity). In addition, our use of a tight binding model originally introduced for isolated nanoribbons allows us to discuss some crucial heterostructure's properties in view of those of its isolated building blocks, including charge redistribution at the edges, gap hierarchy inversion, and specific optical selection rules. By bridging the electronic structure to optical absorption spectra in a comprehensive set of systems, this study sets the stage for more refined investigations on the absorption properties of graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.</p>

            <p>The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.</p>

Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.</p>

            <p>Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</p>

            <p>We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The inelastic carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order using quasi-equilibrium Green's functions. It captures the combined effects of charge-carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption, and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Unlike the measurements, however, they do not increase at high doping concentrations in our model, which does not include scattering-mediated light absorption and/or carrier escape. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights for optimizing ICL carrier injectors.</p>

            <h2>Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex V. Plyukhin</p>
            <p>The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism (AM) has brought renewed attention to the Lieb lattice. Here, we broaden the scope of altermagnetic models on the Lieb lattice by using a general scheme based on spin clusters. We design various altermagnetic models with d- and g-wave on the Lieb lattice, and investigate its interplay with spin-orbit coupling. While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Our results highlight the exotic properties of AM, and suggest its potential applications in engineering topological quantum states.</p>

            <p>Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge</p>
            <p>When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</p>

            <p>In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</p>

            <p>We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</p>

We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, we find signatures of the measurement-induced transition observed in the no-click limit in the moments of the work distribution.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on 1.3 GHz niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at 16 MV/m. We also observe an additive effect of O and N impurities in reducing R$_\mathrm{T}$. We discuss these results in the context of field dependent nonequilibrium superconductivity, gap enhancement, and hydrogen trapping mechanisms.</p>

As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched Néel state from Rényi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental Rényi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and Rényi relative entropies.</p>

Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.</p>

The mw fields experienced by NVs across the diamond culet was calculated from Rabi frequency and found to be higher and more uniform than those generated by an equivalent simple mw line, which will improve performance for wide-field, high-pressure measurements to probe spatial variations across samples under pressure.</p>

            <p>Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.</p>

            <p>Accurate optical constants are essential for modelling light propagation, absorption, and ultimately photovoltaic performance in state of the art perovskite solar cells and is especially important for multiple junction or tandem cells. However, available datasets for metal halide perovskites remain sparse, inconsistent in quality, and often suffer from unphysical sub bandgap extinction caused by surface roughness and limitations of conventional ellipsometry fits. Here, we present a comprehensive library of complex refractive indices (n,k) for a technologically relevant set of FA based lead perovskites, spanning bromide compositions from 0 to 100 percent, and mixed Pb Sn perovskites with Sn fractions from 0 to 60 %. Using state of the art fabrication protocols that yield high quality films, we combine variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements with highly sensitive sub bandgap probes, including photothermal deflection spectroscopy for neat lead based perovskites and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy for Pb Sn alloys, to reconstruct fully zeroed dielectric functions across and below the band edge. The measured data are then stitched and recalculated via a Kramers Kronig consistent framework, ensuring physically accurate behaviour across the full spectral range. Finally, we introduce a transformation based interpolation scheme that preserves spectral shape and feature alignment, enabling reliable determination of (n,k) for any intermediate composition or band gap. This complete dataset and interpolation protocol provide a standardized foundation for optical modelling of perovskite and tandem solar cells, addressing longstanding data gaps and supporting accurate simulations of next generation photovoltaic architectures.</p>

            <p>Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katarzyna Sadecka, Marek Korkusinski, Ludmiła Szulakowska, Paweł Hawrylak</p>
            <p>We present a theory of the emission spectrum of magnetoexcitons interacting with a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall state of massive Dirac fermions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in high magnetic fields. Using an ab initio-parametrized massive Dirac fermion model including valley and spin degrees of freedom, combined with exact diagonalization techniques, we show that interband emission from the massive Dirac Fermion magnetoexciton interacting with $\nu = 1$ state directly probes intra-conduction-band excitations of the $\nu = 1$. Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $\nu = 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons. The calculated spectra are consistent with recent experiments [1-3], establishing magneto-spectroscopy as a probe of finite carrier densities in massive Dirac systems.</p>

            <p>The spin properties of excitons and charge carriers in CsPbBr$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystals are investigated by spin-dependent light scattering in magnetic fields up to 10 T. Spin-flip Raman scattering spectra measured under resonant excitation of exciton-polaritons show a rich variety of features provided by the Zeeman splittings of excitons and of electrons and holes interacting with the excitons. The magnitudes and anisotropies of their Landé $g$-factors are measured. A detailed consideration of the responsible mechanisms is presented and discussed in relation to the experimental data, in particular on the polarization properties of the Raman spectra. We consider several mechanisms for the combined spin-flip Raman scattering processes involving resident carriers and photoexcited excitons and suggest new ones, involving trions in the intermediate scattering state. A double electron spin-flip caused by the exciton interaction with two localized or donor-bound electrons is revealed. The spectral lines of Brillouin light scattering on exciton-polaritons shift in energy and become polarization-sensitive in magnetic field, evidencing the splitting of the exciton-polariton dispersion.</p>

            <h2>Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauro B. Braz, Luis G.G.V. Dias da Silva</p>
            <p>We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moiré bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijia Ke, Yusuf Shaidu, Jeffrey B. Neaton</p>
            <p>The degree of electronic coupling between individual layers in few-layer van der Waals heterostructures offers a route to engineer their magnetic, electronic, and optical functionalities. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the electronic coupling between two monolayers of CrSBr, an anisotropic two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor, is highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic with respect to their relative twist angle, exhibiting a pronounced maximum at the twin-stacking configuration. The coupling strength scales with both the degree of overlap of Br orbitals adjacent to the van der Waals gap and the cosine of half of the interlayer spin angle. This enhanced interlayer electronic coupling gives rise to excitons delocalized across the two layers with a strong polarization dependence that reflects the details of the interlayer spin alignment. Our results reveal a sensitive interplay between twist angle, magnetism, and excitonic properties in twin-stacked CrSBr bilayers, and they establish twin stacking as an effective route to engineering interlayer coupling and optical response in anisotropic two-dimensional magnets with rectangular lattices.</p>

            <p>Indium selenide (In$_2$Se$_3$) has garnered significant attention for its intriguing properties and applications in batteries, solar cells, photodetectors and ferroelectric devices. However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry.</p>

Unlike conventional approaches, this method incorporates essential vertex corrections within the same embedded-DMFT formalism used for the electronic structure calculation. Using the cDMFT-derived interaction strengths as input to embedded DMFT yields spectral functions in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments across a wide range of materials, spanning 3d to 5d transition-metal compounds, including correlated metals, Mott insulators, altermagnets, and unconventional superconductors. This unified many-body framework establishes a systematic first-principles route for determining interaction strengths in correlated materials and substantially enhances the predictive power of DFT+DMFT and its extensions.</p>

            <p>Quaternary Heusler alloys offer a versatile platform for engineering magnetic and topological transport phenomena through chemical flexibility and tunable disorder. Here, we report a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the magnetic, magnetotransport, and anomalous Hall properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuFeSi. The compound crystallizes in the LiMgPdSn-type structure with significant Co--Ru antisite disorder and exhibits soft ferromagnetism with a saturation magnetization of $4.21~\mu_{\mathrm{B}}/\mathrm{f.u.}$ at low temperature and a Curie temperature well above room temperature. Hall measurements reveal a robust anomalous Hall effect persisting up to 300~K, with an anomalous Hall conductivity of $\sim 74$~S/cm that is nearly temperature independent. Scaling analysis demonstrates that the anomalous Hall response is dominated by the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. First-principles calculations identify CoRuFeSi as a topologically nontrivial nodal-line semimetal in its ordered phase. Incorporation of experimentally relevant Co--Ru antisite disorder redistributes the Berry curvature and quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed anomalous Hall conductivity, while preserving half-metallicity. These results establish CoRuFeSi as a disorder-tolerant half-metallic ferromagnet with a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at room temperature, highlighting its potential for spintronic and Hall-based device applications.</p>

            <p>We study the canonical problem of a Fermi gas interacting with a weakly repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. To explore the quantum phases across the full range of boson-fermion interactions, we construct a versatile variational ansatz that incorporates pair correlations and correctly captures the different polaron limits. Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point. Our results suggest that first-order quantum phase transitions play a crucial role in the phase diagram of Bose-Fermi mixtures.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an experimental study of microwave single-photon transitions that are magnetic-field-insensitive in degenerate Fermi gases of $^{40}$K. This contrasts with microwave single-photon clock transitions for 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states and two-photon clock transitions for non 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states in bosonic alkali metal atoms. We show that there are two sets of special transitions between two different hyperfine ground states ($|F$=9/2, $m_{F}$=1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, -1/2$\rangle$ and $|$9/2, -1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, 1/2$\rangle$), whose microwave single-photon transition frequency is insensitive to low magnetic fields, as the first-order Zeeman shift is almost completely canceled. By using the microwave spectrum and Ramsey interference fringes, we demonstrate the long-time stability of the coherent transition under magnetic field fluctuations. These magnetic-field-insensitive microwave hyperfine transitions in ultracold $^{40}$K Fermi gases offer promising applications in quantum information and precision measurements.</p>

            <p>Traditional statistical mechanics is constrained by the binary paradigms of identical/distinguishable and bosonic/fermionic particle statistics, leading to a fundamental logical gap in describing systems with partial distinguishability. We propose WH Statistics, a unified theoretical framework governed by three key parameters: continuous distinguishability {\lambda}, exclusion weight \k{appa}, and intrinsic exclusivity {\gamma}. By deriving the microstate count and entropy, we show that this framework naturally recovers the Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, while also incorporating anyons and the classical hard-core (Langmuir) limit. We introduce a class of generalized quasiparticles, termed WHons, which exhibit exotic physical phenomena including non-monotonic degeneracy pressure peaks, Schottky-like specific heat anomalies, and tunable interference effects, driven by the interplay between fractional distinguishability and exclusion. This framework bridges the century-old discontinuity between quantum and classical exclusion principles, providing a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated systems and programmable quantum matter.</p>

We show how martingale properties emerge directly from the structure of reaction propensities without assuming detailed balance. Stochastic simulations of a simple chemical kinetic proofreading network are used to explore the dependence of the exponentiated entropy production on initial conditions and model parameters, validating our new work theorem relationships.

            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next-generation photovoltaics, laser sources and X-ray detectors. There is intense debate as to whether some photoactive halide perovskites exhibit ferroelectric behaviour and whether it might be possible to utilise the bulk photovoltaic effect to enhance the performance of halide perovskite solar cells. Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom. These discoveries together uncover previously hidden ferroic functionality in halide perovskite semiconductors, opening opportunities for enhanced conductivity and photovoltaic behaviour through domain wall engineering.</p>

The altermagnetic spin-splitting in the single-particle dispersion naturally gives rise to a ground state of two-electron bound pairs with nonzero center-of-mass momentum. This finite-momentum pairing can be interpreted as a two-body mechanism underlying the recently proposed altermagnetism-induced Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state. Additionally, when the nearest-neighbor attraction is strong, the resulting finite-momentum bound pairs exhibit a mixture of both spin-singlet and spin-triplet characteristics, suggesting the possibility of unconventional superconductors, where spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings coexist.</p>

            <p>Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>Water's phase diagram remains one of the most intricate and challenging benchmarks in molecular modeling. In this study, we compute the phase diagram of water using an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential trained on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the revPBE-D3 exchange and correlation functional. We compute solid-liquid chemical potential differences and melting points using biased coexistence simulations with the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Starting from these points, we trace coexistence lines using Gibbs-Duhem integration. This combination of methods allows us to consistently map pressure-temperature phase boundaries and reconstruct the full phase diagram between approximately 100-500 K and 0-4 GPa. The stability regions of the main ice polymorphs (Ih, II, V, VI, and VII) are reproduced in close agreement with experiments. As in earlier studies based on DFT, ice III is metastable and there are systematic shifts of coexistence lines with respect to experimental results. Our results demonstrate the capability of our general-purpose ACE potential to capture the complex phase behavior of water across wide thermodynamic conditions.</p>

Within this framework, we systematically revisit the Cross-Hohenberg classification of instabilities to assess the feasibility and characteristics of the various types of instability arising from the interplay between entropic and energetic contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that only type I and type III instabilities (the Cross-Hohenberg classification) can occur in this system; Energetic contributions do not explicitly generate instabilities, but may implicitly control their occurrence through their influence on the fixed-point (steady-state) concentrations. In cases where instabilities of different types coexist, we show that the resulting patterns are highly sensitive to the relative strengths of the competing instabilities.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are routinely used to model diverse atomistic phenomena, yet parameterizing them to accurately capture solid-state phase transformations remains difficult. We present error metrics and data-generation schemes designed to streamline the parameterization of MLIPs for modeling precipitation in multi-component alloys. We developed an algorithm that enumerates symmetrically distinct transformation pathways connecting chemical decorations on different parent crystal structures. Additionally, we introduce the weighted Kendall-$\tau$ coefficient and its semi-grand canonical generalization as metrics for quantifying MLIP accuracy in predicting low-temperature thermodynamics. We apply these approaches to parameterize an MLIP for a dilute Mg-Nd alloy. The resulting potential reproduces the complex early-stage precipitation behavior observed in experiment. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal competition between order-disorder and structural transformations. Furthermore, these results suggest a continuous transition between high-symmetry hcp and bcc crystal structures during aging heat treatments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Marciniak, M. Szymczak</p>
            <p>The development of visual luminescent thermometers capable of exhibiting pronounced color changes in response to temperature variations requires the rational design of phosphors with high spectrally selective thermal sensitivity. In this work, we present a strategy based on phase-transition-induced activation of cross-relaxation processes in LiYO2:Tb3+. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition modifies the point symmetry of Tb3+ ions in the host lattice, enhances the Stark effect, and enables energetic resonance required for efficient cross relaxation. Consequently, emission originating from the 5D3 excited state is rapidly quenched relative to that from the 5D4 level above approximately 300 K, resulting in a distinct temperature-dependent color change of the emitted light from blue to green. This mechanism yields exceptionally high chromaticity-coordinate-based sensitivities, reaching SRx,max = 0.40% K-1 and SRy,max=0.72% K-1 at 410 K. Furthermore, phase-transition-driven modifications of the Tb3+ emission spectral profile enable the realization of a multimode luminescent thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity of SRmax=13% K-1.

            <h2>Phase Transitions in Low-Dimensional Layered Double Perovskites: The Role of the Organic Moieties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Martín-García, Davide Spirito, Giulia Biffi, Sergey Artyukhin, Francesco Bonaccorso, Roman Krahne</p>
            <p>Halide double perovskites are an interesting alternative to Pb-containing counterparts as active materials in optoelectronic devices. Low-dimensional double perovskites are fabricated by introducing large organic cations, resulting in organic/inorganic architectures with one or more inorganic octahedral layers separated by organic cations. Here, we synthesize layered double perovskites based on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 that consist of double (2L) or single (1L) inorganic octahedral layers, using ammonium cations of different size and chemical structure. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals phase transition signatures in both inorganic lattice and organic moieties by detecting variations in their vibrational modes. Changes in the conformational arrangement of the organic cations to an ordered state coincide with a phase transition in the 1L systems with the shortest ammonium moieties. Significant changes of photoluminescence intensity observed around the transition temperature suggest that optical properties may be deeply affected by the octahedral tilts emerging at the phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity in NaAlSi</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixia Zhong, Qi Wang, Zhongzheng Yang, Fanbang Zheng, Wenhui Li, Yanpeng Qi, Shichao Yan</p>
            <p>Here, we report a scanning tunneling microscopy study on an s-wave superconductor NaAlSi, revealing the coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity. This stripe order manifests as a unidirectional spatial charge modulation with a commensurate period of four times the lattice constant. This modulation undergoes a phase shift in the differential conductance maps under opposite bias voltages, while its period remains approximately constant over an energy range of $\pm$50 meV. These features suggest that this stripe is likely a static charge order. Furthermore, we find that the stripe order imposes a periodic modulation on the intensity of the superconducting coherence peaks. This work provides new perspectives on the intricate interplay between stripe order and s-wave superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Thomas M. Henderson, Thomas D. Kühne, Gustavo E. Scuseria</p>
            <p>Mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation can render mean-field (Hartree-Fock, HF) descriptions effective for strongly correlated spin systems. As established in recent work, the application of such approaches is not limited by the nonlocal structure of JW strings or by site ordering, because string operators can be absorbed into Thouless rotations of a Slater determinant, and the variational optimization of a unitary Lie-Algebraic similarity transformation removes any ordering dependence. Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters. We derive the analytic orbital Hessian to diagnose HF stability and compute ground-state correlation energy through the random-phase approximation (RPA). Benchmark results for the XXZ and J1-J2 model on one- and two-dimensional lattices demonstrate that RPA significantly improves mean-field accuracy.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, studying the upper critical field and its anisotropy has been crucial for understanding superconducting mechanism and guiding applications. Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Uranium tellurides span magnetic and superconducting ground states, yet systematic electronic-structure information across the U-Te series remains scarce. In this study, we perform photoemission measurements on freshly prepared UxTey thin films covering the range of bulk stoichiometries under ultra-high vacuum (10^-9 Pa), enabling clean surfaces and compositions matching bulk phases, including the celebrated UTe2. X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) reveal consistent evolution of the U 4f and Te 3d core levels and valence states across the series, in good agreement with the limited bulk data. Supported by uniform ab initio calculations for all U-Te compounds, we identify systematic trends in U-Te hybridization and charge-transfer effects across the series. These results establish thin-film photoemission as a reliable route for mapping electronic-structure trends in tellurides of heavy elements with diverse electronic ground states.</p>

            <p>Atomic substitution provides a controlled route to engineer lattice dynamics in low-symmetry two-dimensional materials. Here, by combining polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we investigate the evolution of phonon characteristics in CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_{x}$ ($0 \leq x \leq \sim 0.5$) upon partial substitution of Br with Cl atoms. Progressive Cl substitution of Br induces systematic shifts of parent CrSBr out-of-plane $A_\textrm{g}$ phonon modes and activates additional Raman features. These features persist across different polarization configurations and excitation energies, reflecting substitution-induced symmetry lowering and local lattice perturbations. Explicit supercell phonon calculations combined with Raman $\Gamma$-density-of-states simulations identify these features as symmetry-lowered descendants of parent modes arising from alloy disorder. Complementary strain-dependent calculations reveal that anisotropic lattice compression plays a key role in renormalizing Cr-S dominated phonons. Under near-resonant excitation, stimulated Raman scattering-like amplification remains observable with increasing Cl content, highlighting the resilience of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in this system.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denan Li, Chris Ahart, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</p>

            <p>Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A {\gamma}-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate {\alpha}-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline {\alpha}-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.</p>

            <h2>Abelian and non-Abelian fractionalized states in twisted MoTe$_2$: A generalized Landau-level theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohao Li, Yunze Ouyang, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators are lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states that realize fractionalized quasiparticles without an external magnetic field. A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $\nu_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $\theta = 2.45^\circ$ and $2.13^\circ$. At $\theta = 2.45^\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $\nu_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL. In contrast, at $\theta = 2.13^\circ$, a charge-density-wave state prevails in the competition with the MR state due to the larger bandwidth. Our variational mapping provides a theoretical framework for exploring exotic fractionalized phases, including non-Abelian states, in realistic systems.</p>

The devices were fabricated on AlGaO/GaO heterostructures grown by ozone MBE on Fe-doped Ga2O3 (010) substrates. The tri-gate MOSHEMTs, with 1 micron-wide fins and Lg=155 nm, exhibit a peak current-gain cut-off frequency fT=70 GHz and a power-gain cut-off frequency fMAX=55 this http URL fT.L product of 10.85 GHz-micron is the highest among reported Ga2O3 FETs to date. The devices show Vth =-0.5 V, an on/off ratio 10^6 I=80 mA/mm, a peak gm=60 mS/mm, and a low gate leakage current of 10^(-10) mA/mm at Vgs=0.5 V. Passivation with a 100 nm ALD Al2O3 layer effectively removes DC/RF dispersion and maintains stable operation under pulsed IV and repeated RF measurements.

            <p>The interplay between the curved spacetimes of general relativity and quantum mechanical systems is an active field of research. However, analysis of relativistic gravitation on extended quantum systems remains understudied. To this end, we study here the effects of a general relativistic curved spacetime on the topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Kitaev superconducting wire. We find that the topological states remain robust and well localized. In the topological insulator we find that the energy level of the topological state becomes shifted away from zero according to the gravitational redshift, breaking the system's chiral symmetry. In contrast, the Majorana zero mode of the topological superconductor remains at zero energy. Furthermore, within the topological superconductor, we identify the possibility of a gravitationally induced topological phase transition leading to the formation of a domain wall, shifting one of the boundary Majorana zero modes into the bulk.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreyes Nallan, Jian-Gang Zhu</p>
            <p>Probabilistic computers replace logic gates with networks of interacting random variables, creating bidirectional systems that can back-derive inputs from outputs. Such architectures enable efficient generation of random samples, implementations of novel algorithms, and natural solutions to classically hard problems such as prime factorization. We present a new physical implementation for these networks: ferromagnetic disks whose magnetization switching process is triggered by current pulses, skewed by external magnetic fields, and randomized by ambient thermal noise. We show that geometry-dependent magnetostatic interactions between these magnetic cells lead to system behavior that emulates deterministic logic gates. Furthermore, by chaining multiple "gates," we achieve a highly accurate bidirectional one-bit full-adder, a proof of concept for complex multi-gate logic functions with reversible information flow. This analog magnetic probabilistic computer methodology improves on other implementations in speed, tunability, and energy efficiency, thereby enabling a powerful new pathway towards practical solution of classically hard problems.</p>

            <p>The rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) induced by self-demagnetization has been investigated in the giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) material Gd$_5$Si$_2$Ge$_2$. This shape-dependent effect had thus far only been reported in pure Gd, marking this as the first analysis of the effect in a sample with a magnetostructural first-order phase transition. By rotating the applied magnetic field vector while keeping its intensity constant, the demagnetizing field within a high-aspect ratio sample changes significantly, resulting in a RMCE. We characterize RMCE by determining the adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$) directly through temperature measurements, and the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M^{rot}$) via magnetometry and magnetostatic simulations. We obtain a remarkable maximum $\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$ of 1.77 K for a constant external field of 0.8 T, higher than that obtained under 1.0 T. The magnetostatic simulations not only corroborate the highly non-monotonous field-dependence of $|\Delta S_{M}^{rot}|$, which reaches 95\% of its maximum value at 0.8 T, 6.12 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for the experimentally measured shape, but also estimate a 35\% increase in the maximum $|\Delta S_{M}^{rot}|$ up to 8.67 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ in a simulated shape with higher aspect ratio.</p>

            <p>We study the Lanczos coefficients in a quadratic model given by an impurity interacting with a multi-mode field of fermions, also known as single impurity Anderson model. We analytically derive closed expressions for the Lanczos coefficients of Majorana fermion operators of the impurity for different structures of the coupling to the hybridisation band at zero temperature. While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model. These altogether evince the inadequacy of the Lanczos coefficients as a reliable criterion for classifying the integrability or chaoticity of the systems. Eventually, in the wide-band limit, we find exponential decay of autocorrelation functions in all the settings $(i)-(iv)$, which demonstrates the different structures of the Lanczos coefficients not being indicative of different physical behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinava Chatterjee, Chao-Xing Liu</p>
            <p>The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.</p>

            <p>Correlating structure with electronic functionality is central to the engineering of quantum materials and devices whose properties depend sensitively on disorder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers high spatial resolution together with access to structural, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. However, electrical transport measurements on functional quantum devices remain rare, particularly at liquid helium temperature. Here, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of niobium nitride (NbN) devices inside a TEM using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder. By optimizing a thermal radiation shield to limit radiation from the nearby pole pieces of the objective lens, we achieve an estimated base sample temperature of 8-9 K, as inferred from the superconducting transition temperatures of our devices. We find that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state, because the base sample temperature is close to the superconducting transition temperature of NbN. Finally, we perform calculations that underscore the importance of cryo-shielding for minimizing thermal radiation onto the device. This capability enables correlative low-temperature TEM studies, in which structural, spectroscopic, and electrical transport data can be obtained from the same device, thereby providing a platform for probing the microscopic origins of quantum phenomena.</p>

K substitution introduces hole carriers, whereas Mn provides local moments, resulting in bulk ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures up to $\sim 17$ K. Intrinsic magnetic ordering is further supported by an anomalous Hall contribution and a specific-heat anomaly near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. A key performance feature is a colossal negative magnetoresistance: for heavily Mn-doped compositions ($y \ge 0.3$), $\mathrm{MR}=[\rho(H)-\rho(0)]/\rho(0)$ reaches approximately $-100\%$ at 2 K and nearly saturates at a relatively low magnetic field of $\sim 0.35\,\mathrm{T}$.

            <p>The LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface hosts a rich range of electronic phenomena, including unconventional electron pairing that in quantum dots gives rise to a negative effective charging energy U. Here, we show freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes naturally hosting negative-U centers, where lateral confinement arises intrinsically, rather than from engineered nanostructures. These centers coexist with gate-tunable superconductivity and can remain stable upon thermal cycling from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature. Transport is in excellent agreement with calculations based on a negative-U Anderson model, and electrostatic simulations indicate characteristic center sizes of 20-80 nm. Our findings suggest that negative-U centers may arise from the intrinsic interfacial inhomogeneity typical of LAO/STO, and should therefore be considered a general feature of the LAO/STO interface. This could have important consequences for the microwave response of interfacial superconducting devices.</p>

The relatively small number of sites in each grid ($\sim 100$) enables us to compute the exact statistical properties of the systems as a function of temperature and chemical potential by Wang-Landau sampling. For each case considered we highlight the existence of distinct low-temperature ``phases'', featuring, among others, regular-polyhedral, cluster-crystal, and worm-like structures. We highlight similarities and differences between these motifs and those observed on the triangular lattice under the same conditions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results for the bottom-up realization of spherical templates with desired functionalities.</p>

            <p>We investigated the electrical conductivity of platinum nanowires with heights ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm, deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Post-deposition processing was employed to enhance the electrical conductivity of the platinum nanowires. Thermal annealing of as-deposited nanowires in air at 225$^{\circ}$C for 4 hours increased electrical conductance by up to five orders of magnitude. After annealing, 22.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$-long nanowires with a height of 36 nm exhibited resistances of approximately 10 k$\Omega$. This nanowire underwent a reduction in height to one-quarter of its original value, a reduction in width to one half, and a reduction in cross-sectional area by approximately one order of magnitude. The platinum-to-carbon weight ratio increased from 35:65 to 85:15. The electrical resistance decreased monotonically as temperature was lowered from room temperature to 100 mK, confirming that annealed FEBID platinum nanowires are promising building blocks for nanoelectronic devices operating at millikelvin temperatures.</p>

The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$. This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with crystal-field splitting and $J$-multiplet mixing jointly renormalizing the Sm$^{3+}$ moment, rather than collective exchange. For $H \parallel c$, the specific heat shows no $\lambda$-type anomaly down to 0.35~K but evolves into a well-defined two-level Schottky peak whose gap grows linearly with field, yielding $g_c\simeq0.62$ and recovering nearly all of $R\ln2$ at high fields, thereby confirming an effective $S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\tfrac12$ Kramers doublet description for $T\lesssim10$~K. Together, these results establish SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a weak-exchange, nearly single-ion triangular Kramers magnet in which frustration produce an anisotropic low-field correlated regime without inducing long-range order.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Avalanche Stability of Many-Body Localization with Power-Law Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longhui Shen, Bin Guo, Zhaoyu Sun</p>
            <p>We investigate the stability of the many-body localized phase against quantum avalanche instabilities in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain with long-range power-law interactions ($V\propto r^{-\alpha}$). By combining exact diagonalization of static properties with Lindblad master equation simulations of open-system dynamics, we systematically map the interplay between interaction range and disorder strength. Our finite-size scaling analysis of entanglement entropy identifies a critical interaction exponent $\alpha_c \approx 2$, which separates a fragile regime, characterized by an exponentially diverging critical disorder, from a robust short-range regime. To rigorously test the system's resistance to avalanches, we couple the boundary to an infinite-temperature bath and track the propagation of the thermalization front into the localized bulk. We find that the characteristic thermalization time follows a unified scaling law, $T_{r_{\text{th}}} \sim \exp[\kappa(\alpha) LW]$ (herein, $L$ is the system size, and $W$ is the disorder intensity), which diverges exponentially with the product of system size and disorder strength. This suppression enables the derivation of a quantitative stability criterion, $W_{\text{stab}}(\alpha)$, representing the minimum critical disorder strength required to maintain avalanche stability. Our results confirm that the MBL phase remains asymptotically stable in the thermodynamic limit when disorder exceeds an interaction-dependent threshold, bridging theoretical debates on long-range MBL and providing a roadmap for observing these dynamics in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <h2>CatMaster: An Agentic Autonomous System for Computational Heterogeneous Catalysis Research</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Honghao Chen, Jiangjie Qiu, Yi Shen Tew, Xiaonan Wang</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend. Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</p>

            <p>The coupling of spin and electronic degrees of freedom via the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an essential ingredient for many proposed future technologies. However, probing the strength and nature of SOI is a significant challenge, especially in heterostructures. Here, we consider the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas (NSdH) effect, a quantum oscillatory effect that occurs under conditions similar to those of the well-known SdH effect, but is second order in the applied electric field. We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI. In particular, we show that the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations in nonlinear conductivities can clearly distinguish between different types of SOI. As a demonstration, we show how NSdH can distinguish between the linear and cubic Rashba couplings that are expected in germanium heterostructures. Our results establish the NSdH effect as a powerful and sensitive probe of SOI, offering a new framework for characterizing materials relevant to topology, spintronics, and solid-state quantum information technologies.</p>

            <h2>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Yang, Zhixin Peng</p>
            <p>We present a unified theoretical framework for effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic potentials based on additive functionals of stochastic processes. By systematically combining the Poisson equation, corrector construction, and martingale decomposition, we show that both the long-time drift and diffusion of overdamped Brownian motion can be derived within a single and transparent scheme. In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states. This work provides a conceptually unified and mathematically controlled route to transport coefficients in periodic media, with direct relevance to stochastic transport, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.</p>

            <p>We studied transport of indirect excitons (IXs) and IX mediated spin transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure in magnetic fields up to 8 T. We observed the long-range IX transport and the long-range IX mediated spin transport in the magnetic fields. The IX transport and spin transport are characterized by the 1/e decay distances reaching $\sim$ 100 micrometers. The decay distance of the spin transport correlates with the decay distance of IX transport. These decay distances first increase and then decrease with increasing IX density for all studied magnetic fields. The long-range IX transport and the long-range spin transport in the magnetic fields are consistent with the similar long-range transport in zero magnetic field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan-Wei Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang</p>
            <p>Topological states of matter in disordered systems without translation symmetry have attracted great interest in recent years. These states with topological characters are not only robust against certain disorders, but also can be counterintuitively induced by disorders from a topologically trivial phase in the clean limit. In this review, we summarize the current theoretical and experimental progress on disorder-induced topological phases in both condensed-matter and artificial systems. We first introduce the topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) induced by random disorders and their topological characterizations and experimental realizations. We then discuss various extensions of TAIs with unique localization phenomena in quasiperiodic and non-Hermitian systems. We also review the theoretical and experimental studies on the disorder-induced topology in dynamical and many-body systems, including topological Anderson-Thouless pumps, disordered correlated topological insulators and average-symmetry protected topological orders acting as interacting TAI phases. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting potential directions for future explorations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashank Kumar Ojha, Jyotirmay Maity, Srimanta Middey</p>
            <p>Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. Müller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</p>

            <p>In modern technology, the optical readout of magnetic information is conventionally achieved by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, i.e., the polarization rotation of reflected light. The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.</p>

We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function. Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices.</p>

            <p>Compositionally complex solid solutions (CCSSs) consist of a randomly mixed single phase with the potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity through their polyelemental surface atom arrangements. However, microstructural complexity originating from multiple principal elements influences local structure, chemistry, and lattice strain, which might also affect electrocatalytic activity. Here, we investigate the effect of Ru content on electrochemistry and defect formation in Au-Pd-Pt-Ru CCSS thin films. Such defects could provide active sites when terminating at the CCSS surface or modify surface composition through preferential segregation. A thin-film material library covering a wide composition range was fabricated by room-temperature combinatorial co-sputtering. High-throughput compositional, structural and functional characterization, including electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical screening, were used to correlate composition and microstructural features with catalytic activity. Three representative compositions selected from the library - Au68Pd13Pt15Ru4, Au27Pd24Pt23Ru26, and Au9Pd21Pt18Ru52 - were examined in detail. The three samples exhibit face-centered cubic structures, with lattice contraction occurring with increasing Ru content. In addition, with increasing Ru content, a transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults was observed. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution reaction activity improves with higher Ru content. Atom probe tomography reveals local compositional fluctuations, including element-specific enrichment and depletion at grain boundaries. The findings provide a new insight into surface atom arrangement design in the CCSS electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.</p>

            <p>We propose to use the self-assembly ability of a block copolymer combined with compression-expansion cycles to obtain CdSe quantum dots (QDs) structures of different morphology. The methodology proposed consists in transferring onto mica mixed Langmuir monolayers of QDs and the polymer poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2 buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated, PS-MA-BEE, previously sheared by 50 compression-expansion cycles. Results indicate that the shear stress takes out nanoparticles at the air-water interface from metastable states and promoted a new equilibrium state of the Langmuir monolayer, then it was transferred onto mica by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) methodology and the morphology of the LB films was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy measurements. Our results show that when the amplitude strain increases the QDs domain size decreases and the LB film becomes more ordered. The dynamic of the monolayer relaxation after cycling involves at least three timescales which are related to the damping of surface fluctuation, raft rearrangement and component movements inside each raft. Brewster Angle Microscopy allowed visualizing in situ the raft rearrangement at the air-water interface.</p>

            <p>We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (\pcst), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.</p>

            <p>Self-interstitials play a central role in governing the mechanical and anti-irradiation properties of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), however, the prediction of interstitial formation energies (Ef) is formidable due to the chemically complex environments in RHEAs. Herein, we develop a framework based on the tight-binding model to quantify the effects of complex alloying and lattice distortion on Ef. Our scheme reveals that Ef is jointly determined by the average d-band center of RHEAs and the d-band width of interstitial sites. Notably, the d-band width mainly depends on the interatomic hopping matrix and atomic size-determined coordination number, which together make the metallic bonding around interstitials in RHEAs resemble the distance-dependence law of van der Waals forces. By capturing d-band coupling character, our descriptor describes both interstitial configurations within a universal framework. Our model reveals a new physical picture of interstitial formation, providing a useful tool for the design of high-performance RHEAs.</p>

            <p>Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is the primary tool for exploring nanoscale functionality, yet standard single-frequency operation is fundamentally limited, because the dynamic tip-sample interaction is mathematically underdetermined. While advanced methods such as Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) and Band Excitation (BE) address this by tracking resonance, they face critical limitations: DART suffers from feedback instability on complex topographies, while Band Excitation is constrained by severe trade-offs between spectral resolution and acquisition speed. Here, we introduce Dynamic Multiband Microscopy (DMM), a general framework that bridges these gaps by combining multifrequency excitation with continuous frequency sweeping. We implement this within an automated experimental workflow that autonomously identifies and targets measurement points of interest. In combination with quantitative interferometric detection, this approach brings SPM to the fundamental limits of noise and spectral sensitivity. Validated on ferroelectric nanofibers, this platform enables simultaneous, crosstalk-free 3D polarization mapping, establishing a universal framework for autonomous, high-fidelity nanoscale metrology.</p>

By shifting the laser beam position on the cantilever, direction-dependent piezoresponse signals are acquired analogous to classical vector PFM, but without the need to rotate the sample. Using polycrystalline ErMnO$_{3}$ as a model system, we demonstrate that the reconstructed piezoresponse vectors correlate one-to-one with the crystallographic orientations of the micrometer-sized grains, carrying grain-orientation and domain-related information. We establish a versatile approach for rapid, multimodal characterization of polycrystalline uniaxial ferroelectrics, enabling automated, high-throughput reconstruction of polarization and grain orientations with nanoscale precision.</p>

            <p>Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.</p>

Using a two-point spatial correlator, we demonstrate statistical time invariance of the evolving configurations and identify scaling forms shared across distinct models. We reveal a pronounced asymmetry in the growth of the largest clusters: one cluster emerges as a giant structure whose characteristic length exceeds the correlation length. Population-dependent scaling forms for the number densities of cluster areas are uncovered.

            <p>Nickelates represent an emerging class of superconductors that demand innovative approaches for structural and electronic phase modulations. Continuous control over superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in nickelates remains particularly challenging, hindering both fundamental understanding and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate SIT in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors utilizing multiple techniques, including an ${operando}$ monitored reduction (OMR) method. OMR enables ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the Ni 3${d}$ orbital electron occupancy from ~3${d}^7$ to ~3${d}^9$. The 3${d}$ occupancy is calibrated through systematic synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. SIT is further modulated via ionic liquid gating and magnetic field. Strikingly different from cuprates, our Nernst effect measurements show that pairing initiates at the onset of the resistive drop. The subsequent emergence of the Meissner effect at zero resistance marks the establishment of global phase coherence. Angle-dependent magnetotransport within the transition temperature regime indicates a mixture of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superconducting characters, suggesting the observed SIT deviates from the canonical 2D model. Our results provide a unique perspective on the interplay of structural and electronic phase transitions in the infinite-layer nickelates across the oxygen content-magnetic field-temperature parameter space.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear optical response as a probe of emergent Lorentz symmetry violation in noncentrosymmetric materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme J. Inacio, Nathanael N. Batista, Wesley Spalenza, Humberto Belich, Juan José Palacios, Wendel S. Paz</p>
            <p>We propose an electrically controlled protocol to detect weak Lorentz-violating (LV) backgrounds through the second-order shift photocurrent in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita Titov, Andrea Trombettoni</p>
            <p>We show that the large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model defined on a general graph has the same critical behavior as the corresponding quantum spherical model and that the critical exponents depend solely on the spectral dimension $d_s$ of the graph. To this end, we employ a classical to quantum mapping and use known results for the large $n$ limit of the classical $O(n)$ model on graphs. Away from the critical point, we discuss the interplay between the Laplacian and the Adjacency matrix in the whole parameter plane of the quantum Hamiltonian. These results allow us to paint the full picture of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model on graphs in the large $n$ limit.</p>

            <h2>Efficient charge transfer in solution-processed PbS Quantum Dot-reduced graphene oxide hybrid materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Martín-García, Anatolii Polovitsyn, Mirko Prato, Iwan Moreels</p>
            <p>Quantum dot - graphene hybrid materials have raised significant interest due to the unique synergy of the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and the transport properties of graphene. This stimulated the development of low-cost and up-scalable solution-processed strategies for hybrid materials with potential application in light harvesting and opto-electronic devices. Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods). We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub Rosiński, Michał Gawełczyk, Matthias Weiß, Hubert J. Krenner, Paweł Machnikowski</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive study of quantum dot (QD) coupling to various phononic modes in a phononic waveguide, combining multiband kp and configuration-interaction (CI) QD state simulations with finite-element waveguide mode modeling. We consider self-assembled Stranski-Krastanov InGaAs/GaAs as well as local droplet-etched GaAs/AlGaAs structures. Using kp-CI calculations, we quantify the strain and piezoelectric responses of InAs and GaAs QDs. By systematically isolating volumetric/shear deformation-potential and piezoelectric channels, we demonstrate how mode symmetries dictate distinct coupling mechanisms. We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree. The deep understanding of QD-acoustic couplings opens pathways to the optimal design of QD and waveguide structures, as well as to improved engineering of acousto-optic quantum interfaces.</p>

            <p>In this work we explore the possibility of using sparse statistical modeling in condensed matter physics. The procedure is employed to two well known problems: elemental superconductors and heavy fermions, and was shown that in most cases performs better than other AI methods, such as machine or deep learning. More importantly, sparse modeling has two major advantages over other methods: the ability to deal with small data sets and in particular its interpretabilty. Namely, sparse modeling can provide insight into the calculation process and allow the users to give physical interpretation of their results. We argue that many other problems in condensed matter physics would benefit from these properties of sparse statistical modeling.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang</p>
            <p>Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Surface wettability, governed by both topography and chemistry, plays a critical role in applications such as heat transfer, lubrication, microfluidics, and surface coatings. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Shiraishi--Mori construction is exhaustive for ferromagnetic quantum many-body scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Omiya</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) constitute a subtle violation of ergodicity through a set of non-thermal eigenstates, referred to as scar states, which are embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum. In a broad class of known examples, these scar states admit a simple interpretation: they are magnon excitations of fixed momentum on top of a ferromagnetic background. In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states. This architecture is closely related to the Shiraishi--Mori construction, and our main theorem establishes that an appropriate generalization of that construction is in fact essentially exhaustive for this class of scar states.</p>

            <p>The exploration of quantum phenomena in complex materials such as moiré superlattices is limited by the O(N^3) scaling of conventional electronic structure methods. Here we introduce a high-performance tight-binding framework that reduces the complexity to O(N^1.5) by transforming the Hamiltonian into a real symmetric form and combining Sylvester's inertia law with LDL decomposition. This approach enables efficient band structure calculations for large systems: solving magic angle twisted bilayer graphene in minutes on a laptop and scaling to 1.5 million atoms within days on a workstation. We apply it to the previously inaccessible ultra-low twist-angle regime (less than 0.16 degree) with mechanical strain relaxation and find robust flat bands persisting down to 0.09 degree. Our framework bridges density functional theory accuracy with large-scale quantum simulation, opening a route to systematic data-driven exploration of mesoscale quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonnathan Pineda, Mario Collura, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignaon, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We investigate operator delocalization in disordered one-dimensional spin chains by introducing -- besides the already known operator mass -- a complementary measure of operator complexity: the operator length. Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.</p>

            <p>Standard quantum metrology relies on ensemble-averaged quantities, such as the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), which often mask the fluctuations inherent to single-shot realizations. In this work, we bridge the gap between quantum information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics by introducing the Conditional Quantum Fisher Information (CQFI). Defined via the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, the CQFI generalizes the classical stochastic Fisher information to the quantum domain. We demonstrate that the CQFI admits a decomposition into incoherent (population) and coherent (basis rotation) contributions, augmented by a transient interference cross-term absent at the ensemble level. Crucially, we show that this cross-term can be negative, signaling destructive interference between classical and quantum information channels along individual trajectories. Leveraging this framework, we construct a stochastic information geometry that defines thermodynamic length and action for single quantum trajectories. Finally, we derive fundamental quantum speed limits valid at the single-trajectory level and validate our results using the quantum jump unraveling of a driven thermal qubit.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.</p>

            <p>Liquid crystal whispering gallery mode microlasers show high sensitivity to external stimuli and distinct spectral features, rendering them ideally suited for various sensing applications. They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments.</p>

            <h2>Connecting Magic Dynamics in Thermofield Double States to Spectral Form Factors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Sun, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>Under unitary evolution, chaotic quantum systems initialized in simple states rapidly develop high complexity, precluding any efficient classical description. Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic.</p>

            <p>Laser hardening of metals occurs under the influence of a shock wave, which changes the distribution and density of one-dimensional defects - dislocations. There is a relationship between the density of dislocations, the grain size and the resistance of a single crystal to shear loading. The mechanism of hardening processes continues to be intensively studied, and the dynamics of defects plays a central role here. In this paper, the dislocation entropy is analyzed from a combinatorial point of view and from the point of view of a physical oscillator with a given energy reserve. Both contributions play an important role in describing the free energy of a one-dimensional ensemble of dislocations, and are necessary to take into account the dynamic processes inside the grain of a polycrystalline structure.

            <p>Two of the most iconic systems of quantum physics are the particle in a box and the Coulomb potential (the third is, of course, the harmonic oscillator). In this expository paper, we consider the quantum solution to the problem of an electron confined between the grounded planes of an infinite capacitor. The potential arises from the image charges that form in the grounded planes, along with the added condition that at x = 0, L, where L is the distance between the planes, the wavefunction must be zero. This effectively couples a hydrogen like system to a particle-in-a-box (PIB) based on L, the distance between the planes. The problem of finding the electrostatic potential of this infinite series of image charges is an old one, going back to at least 1929. Here, we give a short derivation for one of the limiting cases that yields a compact expression and show how the Kellogg infinite summation formula converges to that value. We note here that this potential is a symmetric double well potential, so there will be many familiar properties of its solutions. Then using that potential, we solve Schrödinger's equation using a spectral technique. The limiting forms of a particle in a box for small L (and high E), and that of a (degenerate) bound image charge at large L and small energy are recovered. We also discuss the tunneling level splitting that occurs in the transition from the large L to the small L regime.</p>

            <p>Stochastic resetting describes dynamics which are reinitialized to a reference state at random times. These protocols are attracting significant interest: they can stabilize nonequilibrium stationary states, generate correlations in noninteracting systems, and enable optimal search strategies. While a constant reset probability results in a Markovian dynamics, much less is known about non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting. Here, we analyze memory effects in these processes -- examining the evolution of quantum states and of observables -- through witnesses of non-Markovianity for open quantum systems. We focus on discrete-time reset processes, which are of particular interest as they can be implemented on existing gate-operated quantum devices. We show that these processes are generically described by non-divisible maps and, in non-classical scenarios where the effective reset probability can become negative, can feature revivals in the state distinguishability. Our results reveal non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting and show that a time-dependent reset may be exploited to engineer enhanced stationary quantum correlations.</p>

            <p>Multiphase fluid flows comprising of mesoscale solid particles, liquid droplets, or gas bubbles are common in both natural and man-made systems, but quantifying the energy transfer is challenging due to complex bubble-particle interactions. In this study, we used ultrafast synchrotron X-ray imaging to study the mesoscale dynamic interactions among ultrasonic cavitation bubbles and hydrophobic particles or clusters. Critical dynamic information and data were extracted from the vast amount of X-ray images and then fed into the hybrid analytical-numerical model for calculating the energy transfer from the oscillating bubble and the imploding bubble to the nearby hydrophobic particles. Using the Ni spherical microparticles as an example, at bubble oscillation approximately 16% (80-320 nJ) of the local energy was transferred to the particle. At bubble implosion, the transferred energy increased approximately 26% (0.135-1.09 uJ). Local energy transfer occurred on timescales of 1 us to 1 ms and length scales of 1 um to 1 mm. Within each ultrasound cycle, kinetic and potential energy underwent complex exchanges, with local energy exhibiting a stepwise decay at the end of each cycle. The transferred energy was mainly consumed for enabling highly efficient particle dispersion. This research provides quantitative insights into optimizing hydrophobic nanomaterial dispersion and has broader implications for interfacial energy transfer processes such as making suspensions, composite materials and exfoliated 2D materials.</p>

Under extreme anisotropy, we observe a pronounced directional channeling effect, driven by anomalous symmetry-breaking velocity diffusion, which concentrates light propagation along preferential directions while suppressing transverse spreading.

            <h2>Interpretable, Physics-Informed Learning Reveals Sulfur Adsorption and Poisoning Mechanisms in 13-Atom Icosahedra Nanoclusters</h2>

            <p>Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</p>

We solve the integro-differential system of Smoluchowski-type kinetic and mass balance equations using a computationally efficient numerical algorithm based on low-rank matrices.

Our calculations confirm the tendency of a particulate ensemble to the universal particle-volume distribution to be approached asymptotically after a sufficiently long time, no matter what the initial particle-volume distribution might be.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Nava, Claudia Artiaco, Yuval Gefen, Igor Gornyi, Mikheil Tsitsishvili, Alex Zazunov, Reinhold Egger</p>
            <p>Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

In this work, we investigate an anomalous decay profile of the TERS intensity of the graphene 2D band as the tip-sample separation changes, observations enabled by high TERS efficiency and accuracy in tip-approach and tip-retract procedures. The anomalous results can be properly described by the addition of an ad hoc deformation to the effective tip-sample distance, rationalized here as due to the presence of a liquid meniscus formed via capillary forces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Mottes, Qian-Ze Zhu, Michael P. Brenner</p>
            <p>Stochastic kinetic models describe systems across biology, chemistry, and physics where discrete events and small populations render deterministic approximations inadequate. Parameter inference and inverse design in these systems require optimizing over trajectories generated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, but the discrete reaction events involved are inherently non-differentiable. We present an approach based on straight-through Gumbel-Softmax estimation that maintains exact stochastic simulations in the forward pass while approximating gradients through a continuous relaxation applied only in the backward pass. We demonstrate robust performance on parameter inference in stochastic gene expression, accurately recovering kinetic rates of telegraph promoter models from both moment statistics and full steady-state distributions across diverse and challenging parameter regimes. We further demonstrate the method's applicability to inverse design problems in stochastic thermodynamics, characterizing Pareto-optimal trade-offs between non-equilibrium currents and entropy production. The ability to efficiently differentiate through exact stochastic simulations provides a foundation for systematic inference and rational design across the many domains governed by continuous-time Markov dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Locality forces equal energy spacing of quantum many-body scar towers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas O'Dea, Lei Gioia, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal eigenstates embedded in the spectra of otherwise non-integrable Hamiltonians. Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local "parent" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that if the full set of Dicke states are exact eigenstates of an extensive local Hamiltonian, then their energies must necessarily be equally spaced. Our proof builds on recent results concerning parent Hamiltonians of the $W$ state, together with general algebraic structures underlying such quasiparticle towers. We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars.</p>

            <h2>Superradiant phase transitions in one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases with cavity-induced umklapp scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Song Pan</p>
            <p>The superradiant phase transitions of one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases in a transversely driven optical cavity, under the umklapp condition that the cavity wave number is equal to two times the Fermi wave number, are studied with bosonization and renormalization group techniques. The bosonization of Fermi fields gives rise to an all-to-all sine-Gordon (SG) model due to the cavity-assisted nonlocal interactions, where the Bose fields at any two spatial points are coupled. The superradiant phase transition is then mapped to the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition of the all-to-all SG model. The nesting effect, in which the superradiant phase transition can be triggered by an infinitely small atom-cavity coupling strength, is shown to be preserved for any nonattractive local interactions. For attractive local interactions, the phase transition occurs at a finite critical coupling strength. Nevertheless, the analysis of the scaling dimension indicates that the perturbation of the nonlocal cosine term is indeed relevant (irrelevant) when the scaling dimension is lower (higher) than the critical dimension, similar to the case of an ordinary local SG model. Our work provides an analytical framework for understanding the superradiant phase transitions in low-dimensional correlated intracavity Fermi gases.</p>

            <p>We report calculations of terahertz ellipticities in large-angle, 21.79$^\circ$ and 38.21$^\circ$, commensurate twisted bilayer graphene, and predict values as high as 1.5 millidegrees in the terahertz region for this non-magnetic material. This terahertz circular dichroism exhibits a magnitude comparable to that of chiral materials in the visible region. At low frequencies, the dichroic response is mediated by strong interlayer hybridization, which allows us to probe the symmetry and strength of these couplings. Crucially, lateral interlayer translation tunes this response, in contrast to small twist angle bilayer graphene's near invariance under under interlayer translation. We examine the magnitude and phase of the interlayer coupling for all structures containing fewer than 400 atoms per unit cell. Finally, we find that the dichroism can be manipulated by applying an electric field or with doping.</p>

            <h2>Instability cascades in crumpling mylar sheets follow a log-Poisson statistic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Boettcher, Paula A. Gago</p>
            <p>The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Using extensive simulations to generate long time-series of such buckling events, we show that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material characterized by a logarithmically growing length-scale. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</p>

            <p>In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an \textit{anomalous} transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Additionally, we predict a purely electric-field-driven non-linear out-of-plane magnetization. We compute the anomalous response within a general altermagnet $d$-wave model, with parameters extracted from the ab-initio electronic structure of an altermagnetic bilayer. Our results suggest altermagnetic surfaces as a promising platform for unconventional spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanda Hou, Molan Li, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>We propose a data-driven Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) framework for identifying continuous symmetry generators and their Lie-algebraic structure directly from phase-space trajectory data expressed in canonical coordinates. MLSD parameterizes candidate conserved quantities with neural networks and learns antisymmetric structure coefficients by enforcing Poisson-bracket closure, supplemented by a weak independence regularizer. We validate MLSD on two integrable benchmark systems -- the three-dimensional Kepler problem and the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator -- recovering the expected non-Abelian algebras (respectively $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$) up to basis transformations. This work focuses on integrable benchmark dynamics, where global conserved quantities are well-defined and admit compact representations learnable from canonical-coordinate trajectories. Extending symmetry discovery to mixed or chaotic phase-space regimes is an important direction for future work.</p>

            <p>We investigate the chiral dynamics of locally interacting bosons in a two-leg flux ladder, where on-site interactions, despite being fully isotropic, counterintuitively reverse the flux-induced chiral transport of density distribution. For a Bose-Einstein condensate (in the mean-field regime), this reversal arises from an interactiondriven dynamical band-occupation inversion, which selectively populates single-particle states of the opposing chirality. Strikingly, the chiral-transport inversion has a few-body, hence beyond-mean-field, origin, as the formation of two-body bound states with reversed chirality dominates the few-body dynamics. This dual pathway, that is, occupation inversion and bound-state formation, underlies the chiral-transport inversion, which challenges the conventional wisdom that isotropic interactions cannot bias density transport. Our work reveals the interplay between interactions and chirality and highlights how correlations engineer exotic quantum transport.</p>

First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry, and propose an explanation for the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit in terms of the symmetry category.</p>

            <p>Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been recently observed in certain transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and monolayer 2H-NbSe$_2$. While the pairing channel remains unknown, it has been argued that spin fluctuations can stabilize pairing in the two-component $E'$ channel, a $p$-wave spin-triplet state which could be consistent with some of the reported signatures. Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling, which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures to detect and distinguish the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. We quantify how nematic $E'$ states produce a diagonal anisotropy $\sigma_{xx}\!\neq\!\sigma_{yy}$ due to the broken threefold symmetry ($C_3$), while chiral $E'$ states yield a finite optical Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}^H$ due to broken time-reversal symmetry, and find both signals could be detected in current experiments. For instance, for realistic gaps in the meV range, we predict a relative anisotropy $\Delta\sigma/\sigma\sim10^{-5}$ in the nematic states, and a polar Kerr rotation of $\theta_K\!\sim\!10^{-5}$ rad in the chiral states. These symmetry fingerprints provide a practical route to distinguish nematic and chiral superconducting order in TMD superconductors.</p>

Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Additionally, we present spectroscopic insight into a previously hinted low-temperature phase, and provide evidence of its electronic origin. While shedding light on overlooked aspects of altermagnetism, these findings open pathways to spin-based technologies and lay a foundation for advancing the emerging field of altertronics.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case.</p>

            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Electronic flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices. There is a strong need for unconventional materials and strategies for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics. Here, we demonstrate that in nanowires of the quasi-one-dimensional, fully gapped charge-density-wave material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current, I -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. No residual minimum noise level is reached for the current of the electron-lattice condensate in (TaSe4)2I nanowires. Repeating the measurements for another charge-density wave conductor, NbS3-II, we found a similar reduction below the normal electron limit at room temperature. Our findings signal intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated electron transport regime.</p>

            <p>Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices. In these systems, topological edge states (TESs) have been reported in higher-energy magnon gaps, while the first magnon gap is found to be topologically trivial. In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge already in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs stabilized on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that chiral TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic-field-driven topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them. In addition, we find that TESs can coexist in the first and higher magnon gaps, which could enable frequency-multiplexed magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology and edge transport in noncollinear spin textures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Vianello, Matteo Ferraretto, Luca Salasnich</p>
            <p>We investigate the finite-temperature properties of a bosonic Josephson junction composed of N interacting atoms confined by a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential, modeled by the two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the statistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies, the population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence visibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.</p>

            <h2>Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shriya Gumber, Lorena Alzate-Vargas, Benjamin T. Nebgen, Arjen van Veelen, Smit Kadvani, Tammie Gibson, Richard Messerly</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</p>

            <h2>Marginal Metals and Kosterlitz-Thouless Type Phase Transition in Disordered Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-An Li, Bo Fu, Huaiming Guo, Björn Trauzettel, Song-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by strong numerical evidence and propose an interpretation in terms of vortex-antivortex pairs in the disorder-induced local in-plane spin magnetization. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoconductance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Perturbative renormalization group approach to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene using topological heavy fermion model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Huang, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We develop a perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory for the topological heavy fermion (THF) model, describing magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as an emergent Anderson lattice. Our theory focuses on an energy window where the interactions can be treated perturbatively within the THF model, providing insights into the low-energy physics. In particular, the realistic parameters place MATBG near an intermediate regime where the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the hybridization energy $\gamma$ are comparable, motivating the need for RG analysis. Our approach analytically tracks the flow of single-particle parameters and Coulomb interactions within an energy window below $0.1$ eV, providing implications for distinguishing between Kondo-like ($U\gg \gamma$) and projected-limit/Mott-semimetal ($U\ll \gamma$) scenarios at low energies. We show that the RG flows generically lower the ratio $U/\gamma$ and drive MATBG toward the chiral limit, consistent with the previous numerical study based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald model. The framework presented here also applies to other moiré systems and stoichiometric materials that admit a THF description, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, twisted checkerboard model, and Lieb lattice, among others, providing a foundation for developing low-energy effective theories relevant to a broad class of topological flat-band materials.</p>

            <h2>Realistic modelling of transport properties at finite temperature in magnetic materials by local quantization of a Heisenberg model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Engelke, Christian Heiliger</p>
            <p>The quantitative description of the electrical resistivity of a magnetic material remains challenging to this day. Qualitatively, it is well understood that the temperature-induced lattice and spin disorder determines the temperature dependence of the resistivity. While prior publications reached good agreement with experiment in the so-called supercell or direct approach for non-magnetic materials where the spin-disorder contribution to the resistivity is negligible, an accurate, purely theoretical description of magnetic materials remains elusive. This shortcoming can be attributed to the missing accuracy in the description of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder itself. In this work, we employ a joint approach from \textit{ab-initio} transport calculations and atomistic modeling of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder. Using the example of $\alpha$-Fe, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects using a semiclassical local quantization of the Heisenberg model significantly improves the description of the spin-disorder component to the electrical resistivity. Compared to previous approaches, this model includes the description of magnetic short-range order effects, enabling us to study temperature effects around and above the Curie temperature, where prior mean-field theory-based approaches inevitably predicted a constant contribution.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenze Fan, Juan Wang, Yan Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary Wolfgram, Jeffrey G. Ethier, Matthew Grasinger</p>
            <p>Electro-viscoelastic polymers have been studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes; however, the mechanisms governing their behavior in combined flow and electric fields remain poorly understood. To address this, we model charged polymers across scales. We extend the Rouse model to include charge density along the polymer chain and ambient electric fields, deriving the shear stress under homogeneous shear and electric fields. Viscosity exhibits anisotropic enhancement dependent on field-flow orientation with a scaling factor dependent on a charge sequence relaxation time, dielectric constant, and quadratic electric field term. These results inform a new continuum model--the upper-convected electro-Maxwell (UCEM) model--resembling an upper-convected Maxwell model with polarization stresses expressed through an electric field dyadic subject to upper-convected time derivatives. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of Kremer-Grest chains with charge sequences reveal distinct relaxation timescales for overall chain dynamics versus charge redistribution, manifested in shear and normal stress responses. Critically, upper-convected time derivatives of the electric field dyadic reproduce the viscosity scaling observed in both the Rouse and MD results; while standard continuum formulations without these terms fail to capture the scaling. Analysis of the dynamic rheological properties show that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field, in agreement with recent PMMA experiments.</p>

            <p>Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B 112, 125124 (2025)], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared (1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast (100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, although reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along these lines, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Is maximizing entropy always desirable? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with exploiting correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), represents a transformative strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.</p>

            <p>Recent studies on spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity resulting from the chiral nature of dipolar interactions in curved elements. However, the impact of spin-wave mode type on nonreciprocity remains unexplored. Using micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyzed the propagation of edge, fundamental, and width-quantized spin-wave modes in a ferromagnetic nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section. Our results show that the strength and sign of nonreciprocity depend on the mode type, as well as on the curvature magnitude of the nanowire's top and bottom surfaces and the strength of the external magnetic field. Interestingly, changing the mode type, for instance induced by altering the curvature or magnetic field, result in a significant change in the dispersion relation asymmetry. This effect underscores the important role of spin-wave profiles in nonreciprocity, deepens our fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries, and paves the way for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</p>

            <p>We aim to clarify the confusion and inconsistency in our recent works [1,2], and to address the incompleteness therein. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints is BRST-exact in our theory. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</p>

            <p>This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 67%. The developed algorithms and software modules may be useful to scientists and engineers working in the field of materials science in the future.</p>

            <p>Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</p>

            <p>In this study, we theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We employed a four-band model in which each BETS molecule is considered as a site and a two-band model that considers each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around $T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, which indicates a change in the dominant magnetic fluctuations. A broad structure indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations was observed above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, whereas the spin susceptibility peaked at a wavevector corresponding to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations below $T_\mathrm{kink}$. The kink disappears as the intra-dimer transfer integral increased and the AFM fluctuations were enhanced. Our findings are consistent with those of previous experimental observations, which have also reported a change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.</p>

            <p>We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we show, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.</p>

            <p>The percolation, Ising, and O($n$) models constitute fundamental systems in statistical and condensed matter physics. For short-range-interacting cases, the nature of their phase transitions is well established by renormalization-group theory. However, the universality of the transitions in these models remains elusive when algebraically decaying long-range interactions $\sim 1/r^{d+\sigma}$ are introduced, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $\sigma$ is the decay exponent. Building upon insights from Lévy flight, i.e., long-range simple random walk, we propose three universality diagrams in the $(d,\sigma)$ plane for the percolation model, the O($n$) model, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising model, respectively. The conjectured universality diagrams are consistent with recent high-precision numerical studies and rigorous mathematical results, offering a unified perspective on critical phenomena in systems with long-range interactions.</p>

We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</p>

            <p>Many years of intense research on cuprate superconductors have led to several discoveries, such as the pseudogap and charge density waves (CDW), yet a complete theory is still lacking. By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\it static} holes. With doping, {\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-two-dimensional soliton in a self-repulsive spin-orbit-coupled dipolar binary condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. K. Adhikari</p>
            <p>We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive binary dipolar and nondipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For a weak SO coupling, in a nondipolar BEC, one can have three types of degenerate solitons: a multi-ring soliton with intrinsic vorticity of angular momentum projection $+1$ or $-1$ in one component and 0 in the other, a circularly-asymmetric soliton and a stripe soliton with stripes in the density. For an intermediate SO couplings, the multi-ring soliton ceases to exist and there appears a square-lattice soliton with a spatially-periodic pattern in density on a square lattice, in addition to the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons. In the presence of a dipolar interaction, with the polarization direction aligned in the quasi-2D plane, only the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons appear.</p>

            <h2>Geometry induced net spin polarization of $d$-wave altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic bandstructures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the charge and the spin conductances exhibit characteristic patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Continuum-Field-Theoretical Construction of Conserved Currents, Non-Invertible Symmetries, and Mixed Anomalies in (3+1)D Non-Abelian Topological Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Feng Zhang, Yizhou Huang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dafne Prado Bandeira, Marco Tarzia</p>
            <p>Motivated by the analogy between many-body localization (MBL) and single-particle Anderson localization on hierarchical graphs, we study localization on the Husimi tree, a generalization of the Bethe lattice with a finite density of local loops of arbitrary but finite length. The exact solution of the model provides a transparent and quantitative framework to systematically inspect the effect of loops on localization. Our analysis indicates that local loops enhance resonant processes, thereby reducing the critical disorder with increasing their number and size. At the same time, loops promote local hybridization, leading to an increase in the spatial extent of localized eigenstates. These effects reconcile key discrepancies between MBL phenomenology and its single-particle Anderson analog. These results show that local loops are a crucial structural ingredient for realistic single-particle analogies to many-body Hilbert spaces.</p>

            <p>Altermagnet (AM), a recently identified class of collinear magnet, has garnered significant attention due to its unique combination of zero net magnetization and spin-split energy bands, leading to a variety of novel physical phenomena. Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.</p>

            <p>Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</p>

            <h2>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge</p>
            <p>When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</p>

            <p>We systematically characterize the dynamical evolution of time-parity (PT )-symmetric two-level systems with spin-dependent dissipations. If the control parameters of the gap are linearly tuned with time, the dynamical evolution can be characterized with parabolic cylinder equations which can be analytically solved. We find that the asymptotic behaviors of particle probability on the two levels show initial-state-independent redistribution in the slow-tuning-speed limit as long as the system is nonadiabatically driven across exceptional points. Equal distributions appear when the nondissipative Hamiltonian shows gap closing. So long as the nondissipative Hamiltonian displays level anticrossing, the final distribution becomes unbalanced. The ratios between the occupation probabilities are given analytically. These results are confirmed with numerical simulations. The predicted equal distribution phenomenon may be used to identify the closing of the energy gap from anti-crossing between two energy bands.</p>

            <h2>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Rajakumar, James D. Watson</p>
            <p>Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</p>

            <p>We establish three impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe. Suppose the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector in a high-dimensional subspace $\mathscr{H}_0$ of Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, such as the low-entropy subspace defined by the Past Hypothesis. We show that: (1) Any particular observation is incapable of identifying the universal state vector in $\mathscr{H}_0$ or substantially reducing the set of possibilities. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other. (2) For any reasonably probable measurement outcome and for most pairs of vectors in $\mathscr{H}_0$, that outcome will not appreciably favor one vector over the other. (3) Bayesian updating on any measurement result, unless it is extraordinarily improbable, has a negligible effect on the initial uniform probability distribution over the states in $\mathscr{H}_0$. These findings represent the most stringent epistemic constraints known for a quantum universe and are derived from a typicality theorem in quantum statistical mechanics. We close by considering how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</p>

            <p>We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael et al. [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75-91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode - an explicitly open quantum system - are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</p>

Unlike previous approaches, our formulation applies universally to both bosonic and fermionic setups, and remains valid even in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, allowing for the exact computation of the system's reduced density matrix across all parameter regimes. Remarkably, the GME shares the same operatorial structure as the Redfield equation and depends on a single kernel - a dressed environment correlation function accounting for all virtual interactions between the system and the environment. This simple structure grants a clear physical interpretation and makes the GME easy to simulate numerically, as we show by applying it to an open system based on two fermions coupled via superconductive pairing.</p>

These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials.

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

The obstruction to defining symmetry fractionalization is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose nontriviality signals a failure to define symmetry fractionalization consistently.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Choon-Lin Ho</p>
            <p>A recent interesting development in the dynamics of black hole phase transitions has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the thermodynamic phase transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole</p>

Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uri Levin, Noa Feldman, Moshe Goldstein</p>
            <p>The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\left(A;B\right)=S\left(\rho_{A}\right)+S\left(\rho_{B}\right)-S\left(\rho_{AB}\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.</p>

            <p>Understanding how soft matter systems, including biological ones, can develop collective electromagnetic phenomena under external fields at ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold, followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton - proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse phenomena in hydrogen-bonded media.</p>

            <h2>Direct temperature readout in nonequilibrium quantum thermometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Xie, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear quantum Kibble-Zurek ramps in open systems at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes N. Kriel, Emma C. King, Michael Kastner</p>
            <p>We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.</p>

Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2\pi\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities.

            <p>Recent studies have shown that certain antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials with the same symmetry breaking as ferromagnets can generate sufficiently large ferromagnetic (FM) responses. Here, we report that the new AFM material NbMnAs exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at zero field and at room temperature, despite having only a small net magnetization. A polycrystalline sample of NbMnAs, likely close to stoichiometric composition, exhibited an AFM state with a small spontaneous magnetization of approximately $6 \times 10^{-3} \mu_{\rm B}$/Mn and the AHE below $T_{\rm N}=354\,{\rm K}$. In contrast, single crystals of NbMnAs obtained by a flux method exhibited a deficiency at the As site, {which resulted} in a decrease in $T_{\rm N}$ and an increase in spontaneous magnetization. Although improvement of the single-crystal growth is still required, our study reveals that NbMnAs is a novel material capable of exhibiting significant FM responses derived from antiferromagnetism at room temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Chengzhi Wu, Xuelian Sun, Liangting Ye, Yirui Lu, Hai-Qing Lin, Wenhui Duan, Bing Huang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional Janus structures have garnered rapidly growing attention across multidisciplinary fields. However, despite extensive theoretical and experimental efforts, a principle for designing intrinsic Janus materials remains elusive. Here, we propose a first-principles alloy theory based on cluster expansion, incorporating a strong repulsive interaction of a cation-mediated anion-pair cluster and refined short-range cluster-cluster competitions, to unravel the formation mechanism of intrinsic Janus structures with a distorted 1T phase among numerous competing phases. Our theory not only explains why intrinsic Janus structures are accidentally observed in RhSeCl and BiTeI which are composed of alloyed elements from different groups, but also accurately predicts a wide range of 1T-like intrinsic Janus materials that are ready for synthesis. Intriguingly, as demonstrated in the case of RhSeCl, we reveal that intrinsic Janus materials can exhibit anomalous second-harmonic generation (SHG) with a distinct quantum geometric effect, originating from strong lattice and chemical-potential mirror asymmetry. Furthermore, a novel skin effect unexpectedly emerges in finite-thickness RhSeCl, accompanied by a hidden SHG effect within the bulk region. Our theory paves the way for the ab initio design of intrinsic Janus materials, significantly accelerating progress in Janus science.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic quantum description of surface plasmon polaritons: revealing intrinsic ultrastrong light-matter coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Maurer, Thomas F. Allard, Yanko Todorov, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</p>

            <p>The complex phase diagram of 1T-TiSe2 consists of a charge density wave (CDW) below 200 K, and CDW fluctuations of still unknown origin at higher temperatures. Here, we use time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy and density functional perturbation theory to uncover the formation mechanism of CDW fluctuations and their spectral features at 295 K. We investigated the transient dynamics of fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation, and directly correlate it with the CDW soft-phonon hardening. Surprisingly, our results show that the coherent amplitude mode modulating ultrafast CDW recovery persists above TCDW, and reveal that CDW fluctuations are dominated by the electron-phonon interaction rather than excitonic correlations as commonly believed. Our findings on these microscopic CDW fluctuations clarify the complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, could be useful in understanding the nature of the CDW phase transition in 1T-TiSe2 and similar quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of these interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{x}$. Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.</p>

The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p>

            <p>Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.</p>

            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are highly sought-after states with a possible application in quantum computation. Here, we show that vortex-core MZMs can carry a nontrivial angular momentum. This establishes new `flavors' of Majorana modes, independent of the Chern classification of topological superconductors. The MZM angular momentum is explicitly calculated for a microscopic model of a $d+id$ superconductor placed on a three-dimensional topological insulator ($d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model) using both exact diagonalization and the Chebyshev expansion. We classify all possible quantum numbers of MZMs depending on the windings of the order parameter and underlying normal state. The topological protection of the MZM is set by the bulk gap, quasiparticle poisoning by trivial in-gap states, and its localization length. All these severely limit the stability of MZMs in the $d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model, in contrast to earlier claims. Nevertheless, the possibility of having different flavors of MZM - in the form of angular momentum or something else - can provide a unique path forward for the study of MZMs.</p>

            <p>Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have shown that certain antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials with the same symmetry breaking as ferromagnets can generate sufficiently large ferromagnetic (FM) responses. Here, we report that the new AFM material NbMnAs exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at zero field and at room temperature, despite having only a small net magnetization. A polycrystalline sample of NbMnAs, likely close to stoichiometric composition, exhibited an AFM state with a small spontaneous magnetization of approximately $6 \times 10^{-3} \mu_{\rm B}$/Mn and the AHE below $T_{\rm N}=354\,{\rm K}$. In contrast, single crystals of NbMnAs obtained by a flux method exhibited a deficiency at the As site, {which resulted} in a decrease in $T_{\rm N}$ and an increase in spontaneous magnetization. Although improvement of the single-crystal growth is still required, our study reveals that NbMnAs is a novel material capable of exhibiting significant FM responses derived from antiferromagnetism at room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional Intrinsic Janus Structures: Design Principle and Anomalous Nonlinear Optics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Chengzhi Wu, Xuelian Sun, Liangting Ye, Yirui Lu, Hai-Qing Lin, Wenhui Duan, Bing Huang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional Janus structures have garnered rapidly growing attention across multidisciplinary fields. However, despite extensive theoretical and experimental efforts, a principle for designing intrinsic Janus materials remains elusive. Here, we propose a first-principles alloy theory based on cluster expansion, incorporating a strong repulsive interaction of a cation-mediated anion-pair cluster and refined short-range cluster-cluster competitions, to unravel the formation mechanism of intrinsic Janus structures with a distorted 1T phase among numerous competing phases. Our theory not only explains why intrinsic Janus structures are accidentally observed in RhSeCl and BiTeI which are composed of alloyed elements from different groups, but also accurately predicts a wide range of 1T-like intrinsic Janus materials that are ready for synthesis. Intriguingly, as demonstrated in the case of RhSeCl, we reveal that intrinsic Janus materials can exhibit anomalous second-harmonic generation (SHG) with a distinct quantum geometric effect, originating from strong lattice and chemical-potential mirror asymmetry. Furthermore, a novel skin effect unexpectedly emerges in finite-thickness RhSeCl, accompanied by a hidden SHG effect within the bulk region. Our theory paves the way for the ab initio design of intrinsic Janus materials, significantly accelerating progress in Janus science.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic quantum description of surface plasmon polaritons: revealing intrinsic ultrastrong light-matter coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Maurer, Thomas F. Allard, Yanko Todorov, Guillaume Weick, David Hagenmüller</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</p>

            <p>The complex phase diagram of 1T-TiSe2 consists of a charge density wave (CDW) below 200 K, and CDW fluctuations of still unknown origin at higher temperatures. Here, we use time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy and density functional perturbation theory to uncover the formation mechanism of CDW fluctuations and their spectral features at 295 K. We investigated the transient dynamics of fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation, and directly correlate it with the CDW soft-phonon hardening. Surprisingly, our results show that the coherent amplitude mode modulating ultrafast CDW recovery persists above TCDW, and reveal that CDW fluctuations are dominated by the electron-phonon interaction rather than excitonic correlations as commonly believed. Our findings on these microscopic CDW fluctuations clarify the complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, could be useful in understanding the nature of the CDW phase transition in 1T-TiSe2 and similar quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of these interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{x}$. Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.</p>

            <p>The recent achievement of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with transition temperatures exceeding 40 K in thin films under compressive strain and 80 K in bulk crystals under high pressure opens new avenues for research on high-temperature superconductivity. The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p>

            <p>Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Venditti, Christophe Berthod, Louk Rademaker</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are highly sought-after states with a possible application in quantum computation. Here, we show that vortex-core MZMs can carry a nontrivial angular momentum. This establishes new `flavors' of Majorana modes, independent of the Chern classification of topological superconductors. The MZM angular momentum is explicitly calculated for a microscopic model of a $d+id$ superconductor placed on a three-dimensional topological insulator ($d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model) using both exact diagonalization and the Chebyshev expansion. We classify all possible quantum numbers of MZMs depending on the windings of the order parameter and underlying normal state. The topological protection of the MZM is set by the bulk gap, quasiparticle poisoning by trivial in-gap states, and its localization length. All these severely limit the stability of MZMs in the $d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model, in contrast to earlier claims. Nevertheless, the possibility of having different flavors of MZM - in the form of angular momentum or something else - can provide a unique path forward for the study of MZMs.</p>

            <p>Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</p>

            <p>We analyze the dispersion of collective modes in a superconductor with $d-$wave symmetry of the order parameter in the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction. We use diagrammatic technique and quasiclassical theory in Keldysh-Nambu formalism to compute longitudinal and transverse pair susceptibilities and extract from them the dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse collective mode. We show that at T=0, the dispersion of the transverse (plasma) mode is the same as in an s-wave superconductor, but at a finite temperature it is softer and has a much larger decay rate due to the partial screening of the Coulomb potential by nodal quasiparticles. We show that the dispersion of the longitudinal mode depends on the direction of momentum with respect to the positions of the nodes of the d-wave gap, while the decay rate of this mode does not depend on momentum. We discuss experimental implications of our results.</p>

            <h2>Highly efficient superconducting diode effect in unconventional $p$-wave magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor de M. Froldi, Hermann Freire</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of superconducting phases, both with zero and finite Cooper-pair center of mass momenta, in recently proposed unconventional $p$-wave magnets. As a consequence, we find that, while these magnetic phases are in principle compatible with a conventional pairing state at zero field, a Fulde-Ferrell phase can generally be promoted as the leading instability under the application of a finite magnetic field. Interestingly, by calculating the efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of this finite momentum pairing state via a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we uncover that a high efficiency can be obtained in these systems for experimentally relevant spin splittings. Therefore, our prediction reveals that the experimental discovery of these new materials represents a promising platform for the construction of energy-efficient logic circuits that can potentially be used, e.g., in the fields of classical and quantum computing.</p>

Using exact Floquet dynamics, Floquet perturbation theory, and optimal-order van Vleck analysis, we identify a fine-tuned amplitude-to-frequency ratio where all Floquet states become localized despite dense resonances. The van Vleck expansion achieves superasymptotic accuracy up to an optimal orde; it ultimately breaks down due to resonant hybridization at a weak quasiperiodic potential, revealing that the observed localization is nonperturbative.</p>

            <p>We have examined the electrical behavior of Josephson junctions formed by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a Nb sample and a Nb tip, with normal-state resistances Rn varying between 1 kOhm and 10 MOhm. Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links.</p>

            <p>Catalysis-driven synthetic molecular motors operate in a loose mechanochemical coupling regime, one in which a decomposition of a fuel molecule does not reliably produce a forward step. In that regime, stochastic backward steps can significantly degrade the motor's current, prompting us to ask whether mechanically coupling multiple such motors can boost their averaged current. By simulating rotaxane-based motors with two classes of models--particle-based nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and jump-diffusion models--we show that current boosts are physically achievable. Our observed boosts, which amplify current by single-digit factors, emerge when coupling between motors can increase the activity, speeding up the rate of both forward and backward steps. In doing so, the bias for preferring forward steps actually degrades, but the lost bias can be largely recovered by raising the fuel concentration, demonstrating a general design strategy: amplify activity through coupling and restore bias through stronger driving.</p>

            <p>We employ state-of-the-art first-principles calculations to investigate the shandite compounds Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, which host Weyl fermions and complex magnetic textures. Their magnetic structures are governed primarily by exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, whereas the symmetry-allowed alternating-layer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to be negligible. We identify a previously unrecognized spin-chiral interaction (SCI) arising from the kagome lattice topology, which plays a decisive role in stabilizing the experimentally observed magnetic textures. The extracted magnetic parameters reproduce experimental trends, with the SCI emerging as a novel and dominant contribution. The calculated SCI strengths are 0.78 meV, 0.86 meV, and 0.87 meV for Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that short-wavelength magnetic textures drive phase transitions of the Weyl nodes, resulting in band flattening and the opening of an emergent gap. This newly identified SCI, together with the associated electronically driven phase transitions, provides a promising route for manipulating transport properties in spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid in a half-filled Chern band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Pavel A. Nosov</p>
            <p>The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryosuke Akashi</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in sulfur superhydride H$_{3}$S under extreme pressures has been explained theoretically, but it requires a peaked concentration of the electronic density of states (DOS), which has been found in first-principles calculations. The mechanism of this peak formation, though vital for its high transition temperature, has however remained obscure. We address this problem through detailed analysis of the first-principles electronic wave functions. The valence wave functions are shown to be significantly plane-wave-like. From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors.</p>

            <p>We study one-dimensional quantum gases in continuous space with cavity-mediated infinite-range interactions using variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods. Starting from the exact two-body solution, we construct a non-translationally invariant Jastrow wavefunction that accurately captures the spatial structure induced by the cavity field and provides an efficient many-body ansatz for both bosonic and fermionic systems. We analize properties of three characteristic quantum systems, subject to long-range interactions: (i) ideal Bose gas (ii) interacting Bose gas (iii) ideal Fermi gas. In the absence of short-range interactions, we identify a crossover from a stable, weakly modulated phase realized for repulsive interactions to a delocalized bound state for attractive interactions, marked by clustering, loss of superfluidity, and the absence of a thermodynamic limit. Introducing short-range repulsion, either through contact interactions or fermionic statistics, leads to the formation of a mesoscopic gas-like regime that disappears in the thermodynamic limit. A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties.</p>

            <p>Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum solver for single-impurity Anderson models with particle-hole symmetry</h2>

            <p>Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.</p>

            <h2>Curvature effect induces topological phase transitions in two dimensional topological superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan-Wen Lai, Meng-Chien Wang, Ching-Ray Chang, Seng-Ghee Tan</p>
            <p>Recently, topological superconductors have emerged as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics, owing to the exotic properties of Majorana quasiparticles residing on edges, surfaces, and vortex cores. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional s+p wave noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCS) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on a cylindrical manifold. By employing a thin-layer quantization approach, we derive the effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian to elucidate the interplay between surface curvature and topological phase transitions. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the curvature-induced geometric potential (da Costa potential) and the spatial reconfiguration of spin-momentum locking effectively modulate the superconducting gap. From a band theory perspective, we confirm that curvature serves as a critical tuning parameter, capable of driving topological phase transitions by inducing band inversion.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marija Stojkovic, Edward Linscott, Nicola Marzari</p>
            <p>Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</p>

            <h2>Time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Naoto Kan, Hidenori Fukaya</p>
            <p>We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three-dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zicun Li, Huanjing Gong, Ruijuan Xiao, Xinguo Ren</p>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.</p>

            <h2>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prabakaran Rajamanickam</p>
            <p>Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau-de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\ep = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\ep \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\ep)$ correction to the director field, in contrast to the $O(1/\ep^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Importantly, a stability analysis based on the intrinsic-basis decomposition shows that even small deviations of $O(1/\ep^2)$ from perfect scalar order can destabilise some Oseen-Frank solutions, indicating that only a restricted subset of solutions are realised as stable equilibria in the full Landau-de Gennes theory. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. These results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for modelling nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale systems.</p>

            <p>We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.</p>

            <h2>Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul L. Ebert, Yasir Iqbal, Alexander Wietek</p>
            <p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiko G. Yamada</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c > 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.</p>

            <p>The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics. Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness. Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.</p>

            <p>The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</p>

            <h2>A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion</h2>

            <p>Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balram Singh, Aman Singh, Stefan Mikulik, Jakub Jurczyk, Volker Neu, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco</p>
            <p>The exchange bias (EB) effect, arising from interfacial coupling between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers, induces a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy and underpins a wide range of spintronic functionalities. Extending the EB effect to three-dimensional (3D) architectures enables investigation of interfacial coupling in non-planar structures, which is a key step toward realizing spintronic functionalities beyond planar systems. Achieving this requires the fabrication of FM/AF bilayers with smooth interfaces and well-defined thicknesses on non-planar scaffolds, together with suitable characterization methods. In this work, we realize exchange-biased 3D FM/AF microwires by combining two-photon lithography with magnetron sputtering. CoFe/IrMn bilayers are deposited on microwire scaffolds with inclination angles of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg relative to the substrate, and their magnetization reversal is probed using dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry. We find that the EB and coercive fields vary in a characteristic way with the inclination angle, consistent with the systematic reduction in film thickness expected from inclined directional deposition. In addition, the EB magnitude is influenced by the combined effects of surface roughness of non-planar geometries and the directional growth of the bilayer, highlighting the importance of 3D scaffold surface quality for integrating magnetic multilayers. These results provide insight into the growth and magnetic behavior of sputter-deposited magnetic multilayers with functional interfaces on 3D geometries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Andrew L. Goodwin, Clare P. Grey, Siân E. Dutton</p>
            <p>Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the inter-membrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-Pérot and inter-membrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-Pérot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the collective motion of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.</p>

            <p>The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Kikuchi</p>
            <p>Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</p>

We study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. We observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, outperforming D$_2$ and HD. We use a reaction network model to describe the chemical dynamics and find that the enhanced molecular yield can be attributed to rapid vibrational excitations of the reactant gas.

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and a promising platform for future quantum information technology as silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times in solid-state. At the same time, silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics activity, and photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity and find the optimal donor species for different coupling mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Resonant fragility and nonresonant robustness of Floquet eigenstates in kicked spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesús A. Segura-Landa, Meenu Kumari, Daniel J. Nader, Sercan Hüsnügil, Ali SaraerToosi, Sergio Lerma-Hernández</p>
            <p>In classical systems, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem establishes that resonant tori of integrable Hamiltonians are destroyed by any nonintegrable perturbation, whereas nonresonant tori are only deformed up to a finite value of the perturbation parameter. In this contribution, we identify a quantum analog of this differentiated sensitivity for one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians subject to periodic instantaneous kicks. After detecting quantum signatures of resonances in the participation ratio and in the quasiprobability phase-space distribution of Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we show that eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian exhibit greater sensitivity against the perturbation when they satisfy a resonant condition. The sensitivity is quantified through the fidelity between perturbed and unperturbed eigenstates. This differentiated sensitivity becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows. Our findings are supported by numerical results and insights from analytical calculations based on unitary perturbation theory. Although our analysis focuses on kicked models, the mechanism could be extended to more general periodic drivings, providing a preliminary step toward a quantum counterpart of the classical breaking of resonant tori.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Levitt (LMO), Douglas Lundholm, Nicolas Rougerie (UMPA-ENSL)</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{ö}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</p>

            <p>Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</p>

            <h2>On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Huang, Qing-yu Cai</p>
            <p>This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by interactions that induce random-phase fluctuations. By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details, provided the coherent accumulation of systematic biases does not overwhelm the random-phase fluctuations. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. To quantitatively capture the probability distribution, we introduce a hierarchical ansatz approach. A Lorentzian ansatz models the bulk region, leading to self-consistent equations for the broadening and shift parameters, and yields a logarithmic entropy scaling with interaction strength. For the tail behavior, a Gaussian ansatz is formulated, and the corresponding self-consistent condition is derived and validated. By further combining these profiles into an enhanced Lorentzian-Gaussian hybrid ansatz, we achieve a unified and refined description of the full distribution. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm the predicted logarithmic entropy scaling and validate the self-consistent equations. Our framework effectively bridges the concepts of observational entropy and von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. These results resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirco Erpelding, Adrian Braemer, Martin Gärttner</p>
            <p>Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of superoperators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanming Che, Clemens Gneiting, Xiaoguang Wang, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</p>

            <p>Systematic exploration of amorphous ABC heterostructures revealed that nanoscale morphological modifications markedly improved their artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures were fabricated through plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking the centrosymmetry on the nanoscale. We observe a dependence of the optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials, SiO$_2$, TiO$_2$, and Al$_2$O$_3$, ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these thin films exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz} = 2.0 \pm 0.2$~pm/V at the wavelength of 1032~nm is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</p>

Interestingly, systems of this form can exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts.

By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Foster Thompson, Daniel K. J. Boneß, Mark Dykman, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.</p>

            <h2>Hidden long-range correlations in the ion distribution at the graphite / [bmim][NTf$_2$] electrified interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Veloza-Diaz, Robinson Cortes-Huerto, Pietro Ballone, Nancy C. Forero-Martinez</p>
            <p>A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Despite a few peculiarities due to the size and complexity of the ions, properties such as the density of ions throughout the capacitor, the screening of the surface charge on the electrodes by the IL and exact sum rules for the radial distribution functions of cations and anions generally comply with the results of time honored theories of the electrostatic double layer. This soothing regularity may conceal hidden correlations still compatible with the static screening rules, propagating far inside the IL the information on the state of charge of the capacitor. Evidence in this respect might have been detected by vibrational spectroscopy (see, for instance, Langmuir 2021, vol. 37, 5193-5201) showing changes in optical properties of the IL far from the charged electrodes. We show that grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into instantaneous neutral pairs reveals an intriguing long range ordering of ions normal to the interface, driven by the capacitor state of charge. These correlations manifest themselves through the parallel orientation of the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. We speculate that this effect changes the average intensity of fluctuating electric fields deep in the IL, while average, static fields vanish in agreement with well established screening laws. This effect, which could change the spectroscopic properties of the IL, is present in the simulated [bmim][NTf$_2$] / graphite capacitor, but too small to be unambiguously confirmed by the present simulations with a safe margin over the error bar. The conceptual interest in these effects, however, will motivate further studies of the same or similar electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Emergent chiral Higgs mode in $π$-flux frustrated lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Lanaro, Lorenzo Maffi, Marco Di Liberto</p>
            <p>Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Driven "Sinusoidal" Valley Control of Hybridized $Γ-\mathrm{K}$ Excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingtong Zhu, Kang Lan, Shiling Li, Ning Hao, Ping Zhang, Jiyong Fu</p>
            <p>The photoluminescence (PL) of momentum-indirect $\rm \Gamma- K$ excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ under biaxial strain was recently observed by Blundo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067402 (2022)], yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here we develop a unified framework that reproduces the measured PL and reveals its fundamental excitonic mechanism. We reveal that: (i) the PL originates from genuinely hybridized direct-indirect excitonic eigenstates, rather than nominally mixed species with fixed dominant character; (ii) the direct exciton converts into the indirect one via a previously unrecognized two-step pathway -- exchange-interaction-driven exciton transfer followed by a spin flip; and (iii) a higher-energy indirect exciton, absent from prior studies, acts as a crucial intermediate mediating this conversion. Beyond explaining experiment, our theory predicts a striking strain-driven "sinusoidal'' valley response, furnishing a continuously tunable valley dial that far exceeds binary control schemes. This unified picture of strain-engineered direct-indirect exciton dynamics introduces a new paradigm for manipulating long-lived valley degrees of freedom, opening a pathway toward programmable valley pseudospin engineering and next-generation valleytronic quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahas Kamat, Jared Dans, Shanta Saha, Daniel F. Agterberg, Johnpierre Paglione, B. J. Ramshaw</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in three dimensions is almost universally governed by Ginzburg-Landau mean field theory, with critical fluctuations typically confined to within a few percent of the transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to "local" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Xi Li, Rui-Qiang Wang, Ming-Xun Deng, Hou-Jian Duan</p>
            <p>We present a systematic study of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films under both dark and illuminated conditions. In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure.</p>

We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, in which its altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate in connection with crystal-orientation-dependent spintronic functionalities. By elucidating the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal using micro-ARPES, we found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures show a good agreement with the bulk-band calculations for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with those for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization in the bulk bands, suggesting the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. In addition, we identified a nearly flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively. Our first-principles calculations and analysis of Berry phase attribute these states to the topological surface bands emerging from the bulk Dirac nodal lines around the Fermi level. Our results indicate that such topological surface/interface states must be considered to understand the spintronic functionalities of RuO2, and may provide new insights into its catalytic characteristics.</p>

            <p>The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</p>

            <p>Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</p>

            <p>The mechanisms of fast low-temperature Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) of W + 10% wt. Ni powders were investigated. The powder compositions were obtained in two methods: (i) by mixing W and Ni powders in a specified ratio (hereinafter referred to as W + Ni); (ii) by Ni deposition on the surface of submicron W particles allowing the formation of particles with a core W - shell Ni structure (hereinafter referred to as W@Ni). To reduce the concentrations of oxygen and oxides, the powders were annealed in hydrogen. The solid-phase sintering was performed at various temperatures (1000-1150°C), pressures (40-80 MPa), heating rates (50-500°C/min), and isothermal holding times (0-20 min). The sintering temperatures corresponded to the onset of intense dissolution of W in Ni. The samples had high relative density and small grain sizes. The activation energy of SPS of the mixed powders was close to the one of the grain boundary diffusion. The key mechanism for the compaction of W@Ni particles in the SPS process is Coble creep. The increasing of the sintering temperature was shown to lead to an increase in the solubility of W in Ni and, consequently, to an increase in the number of secondary Ni4W particles formed during cooling down. The grain growth has a minor effect on the mechanical properties of the W alloy compared to the changes in its phase composition.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a growing appreciation for the effects of quantum critical fluctuations on gapless boundary degrees of freedom. Here we consider the boundary dynamics of the non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (NCCP$^{N-1}$) model in two spatial dimensions, with $N$ complex boson species coupled to a fluctuating $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field. These models describe quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm, such as the deconfined quantum critical point between superconducting (SC) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) phases. We show that, in a large-$N$ limit and with the bulk tuned to criticality, boundaries of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model display logarithmically decaying, or ``extraordinary-log,'' correlations. In particular, when monopole operators exhibit quasi-long-ranged order at the boundary, we find that the extraordinary-log exponent of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit is $q=N/4$, signifying a new family of boundary universality classes parameterized by $N$. In the context of the QSH -- SC transition, the quantum critical point inherits helical edge modes from the QSH phase, and this extraordinary-log behavior manifests in their Cooper pair correlations.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Two-Body Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil Karuzin, Leonid Levitov</p>
            <p>Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring whenever $\Phi$ crosses integer values. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little--Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</p>

            <h2>Multi-level charge fluctuations in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan Albrecht, Feiyang Ye, N. Tobias Jacobson, John M. Nichol</p>
            <p>Discrete charge fluctuations, routinely observed in semiconductor quantum dot devices, may contribute significantly to device drift and errors resulting from qubit miscalibration. Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 \mu$eV/mV up to $4 \mu$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes. We expect that these characterization results may aid in subsequent spatial triangulation of the charge fluctuators.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoelectric torque in polar magnetic bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong Shen, Jun Chen, Xiaoyan Yao, Shuai Dong</p>
            <p>Energy-efficient fast switching of spin orientations or textures is a core issue of spintronics, which is highly demanded but remains challenging. Different from the mainstream routes based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbit torque, here we propose another mechanism coined as magnetoelectric torque to switch the magnetization in polar magnetic bilayers via pure electric field. In some magnetic van der Waals bilayers, when the electrostatic energy of polarization can compensate the interlayer magnetic coupling, a magnetoelectric torque is generated to fastly flip spins within a few picoseconds, which is demonstrated by combining the first-principles calculations, analytic model, as well as atomistic simulations. Such a magnetoelectric torque doesn't rely on the spin-orbit coupling and is generally active in polar magnetic homostructures and heterostructures. Our work provides an alternative route to switch magnetization in nanoscale, which may benefit the energy-saving and fast-response spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Large room temperature anomalous Nernst effect coupled with topological Nernst effect from incommensurate spin structure in a Kagome antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajun Ma, Jiaxing Liao, Yazhou Li, Yuwei Zhang, Jialu Wang, Jinke Bao, Yan Sun, Shuang Jia, Yuke Li</p>
            <p>Kagome magnets exhibit a range of novel and nontrivial topological properties due to the strong interplay between topology and magnetism, which also extends to their thermoelectric applications. Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 {\mu}V K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 {\mu}V K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system.</p>

            <h2>Nodal-line-enhanced quantum geometric effects: anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects in the parity-mixed antiferromagnet NbMnP</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ibuki Terada, Vu Thi Ngoc Huyen, Yuki Yanagi, Michi-To Suzuki</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall effect has been understood in terms of the geometric nature of Bloch bands and impurity scattering, and has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic materials such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Recently, a large anomalous Hall effect was reported in the noncollinear antiferromagnetic metal NbMnP whose magnetic order is a mixture of the even-parity and the odd-parity magnetic components. Such a magnetic structure is expected to exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect from the symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet ordering. Here, we theoretically investigate the intrinsic anomalous and nonlinear Hall effect of NbMnP induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch band using the first-principles calculation and the Wannier interpolation method. We found that the intrinsic Hall response of NbMnP is predominantly governed by the strongly enhanced Berry curvature and Berry-connection-polarization dipole on a specific mirror plane. These enhanced geometric quantities originate from the spin-orbit-coupling-induced gap openings along the nodal lines. Our results indicate that NbMnP serves as a model system for investigating transport phenomena originating from nodal-lines in parity-mixed antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Critical quantum states and hierarchical spectral statistics in a Cantor potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Iwase</p>
            <p>We study the spectral statistics and wave-function properties of a one-dimensional quantum system subject to a Cantor-type fractal potential. By analyzing the nearest-neighbor level spacings, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and the scaling behavior of the integrated density of states (IDS), we demonstrate how the self-similar geometry of the potential is imprinted on the quantum spectrum. The energy-resolved level spacings form a hierarchical, filamentary structure, in sharp contrast to those of periodic and random systems. The normalized level-spacing distribution exhibits a bimodal structure, reflecting the deterministic recurrence of spectral gaps. A multifractal analysis of eigenstates reveals critical behavior: the generalized fractal dimensions $D_q$ lie strictly between the limits of extended and localized states, exhibiting a distinct $q$-dependence. Consistently, the IPR indicates the coexistence of quasi-extended and localized features, characteristic of critical wave functions. The IDS shows anomalous power-law scaling at low energies, with an exponent close to the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying Cantor set, indicating that the geometric fractality governs the spectral dimensionality. At higher energies, this scaling crosses over to the semiclassical Weyl law. Our results establish a direct connection between deterministic fractal geometry, hierarchical spectral statistics, and quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>The complexity of biomolecular interactions necessitates advanced methodologies to accurately capture their behavior in solution. In this work, we focus on monoclonal antibodies and adopt a multi-scale coarse-graining strategy for their modeling, with particular emphasis on the role of electrostatic interactions. Using scattering experiments, theoretical analysis, and large-scale computer simulations, we explicitly compare two selected case studies-markedly different in their charge distributions. Through mutually corroborating lines of evidence, we demonstrate that conventional approaches relying on electrostatic screening and implicit charge representations fail to capture the structural and thermodynamic properties of antibody solutions when strong charge heterogeneity is present, even at a moderate (amino acid) level of coarse-graining. These findings highlight the importance of a correct treatment of electrostatic interactions and ion screening for heterogeneously- and oppositely-charged colloidal and protein systems. Such considerations are essential to move beyond descriptive models towards a truly predictive framework, with direct implications for the formulation of therapeutics and the treatment of other complex soft-matter systems.</p>

            <p>Spin transfer torques (STTs) control magnetisation by electric currents, enabling a range of nano-scale spintronic applications. They can destabilise the equilibrium magnetisation state by counteracting magnetic relaxation. Here, we maximise the STT effect through a dedicated growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, such that magnetic anisotropies originating from the interface and shape almost cancel each other. The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware. Our results establish isotropic magnets as a platform to study as-yet-uncharted, far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics including anti-magnonics, with promising implications for unconventional computing paradigms.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles framework for the calculation of phonons in nanostructures with cyclic and/or helical symmetry. In particular, we derive a cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted representation of the dynamical matrix at arbitrary phonon wavevectors within a variationally formulated, symmetry-adapted density functional perturbation theory framework. In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.</p>

            <p>Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.</p>

            <p>Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</p>

            <p>The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which is corroborated by the fit of magnetic specific heat data following the J1-J2 model with the nearest neighbor exchange interaction of J1 = -0.197 K between the Jeff = 1/2 states of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our {\mu}SR experiments that support the realization of Jeff = 1/2 at low temperatures. The specific heat experiments do not detect a phase transition down to 56 mK. The magnetic specific heat shows a broad maximum 90 mK suggesting a disordered ground state with short range spin correlations. The associated magnetic entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field {\mu}SR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest a dynamic, disordered ground state in this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet.

            <p>We theoretically investigate the stable mechanism of a ring soliton in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and their time-dependent counterparts. In the uniform situation, we discover that the ring soliton is always driven away from its initial location, and moves towards the edge due to a curvature-induced effective potential. The ring soliton is impossible to remain static at any location in the uniform system. To balance the density difference between the ring soliton's two sides, a harmonic trap is introduced, which can exert an effect to counterbalances the curvature-induced effective potential. This enables the ring dark soliton to become a stable state at a particular equilibrium position r_s, where the free energy of the ring dark soliton just reaches the maximum value. Once ring soliton is slightly deviated from r_s, some stable periodic oscillations of ring soliton around r_s will turn out. Some dissipation will possibly occur to ring soliton once its minimum radius is comparable to the healing length of soliton's Friedel oscillation. This dissipation will increase the oscillation amplitude and finally make the ring soliton decay into sound ripples. Our research lays the groundwork for a more in-depth understanding of the stable mechanism of a ring dark soliton in the future.</p>

We introduce a general framework to incorporate multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way, showing that additional modes contribute small energy corrections noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation, these contributions reduce to a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal plane, providing a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. Together, these results establish a rigorous framework for describing polaritonic states in crystalline solids.</p>

            <p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p>

            <p>Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</p>

            <p>Selective spectroscopic disentanglement of surface and bulk quantum orders remains an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems.</p>

We show here that a slightly weaker property of the limit free energy does extend to non-convex models. Indeed, under the assumption that the limit free energy exists, we show that this limit can always be represented as a critical value of the said functional. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, we also show that any subsequential limit of the law of the overlap matrix is a critical point of this functional.

            <p>Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshali Mitra, Sukrut Mondkar, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Alexander Soloviev</p>
            <p>Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature. We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Stubenrauch, Naomi Auer, Richard Kempter, Benjamin Lindner</p>
            <p>Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

            <h2>Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Galen J. Wilkerson</p>
            <p>Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</p>

            <h2>Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Barthelemy</p>
            <p>We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Memory Extension of Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramandeep Dewan</p>
            <p>Tegmark's decoherence bound is derived under the assumption of a strictly memoryless environment. We show that this result corresponds to the singular limit of a finite-memory theory. For exponentially correlated environments decoherence is generically quadratic at short times and the decoherence time scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bath we derive the exact non-Markovian coherence equation and verify the predicted scaling using an exact pseudomode mapping. Tegmark's bound is recovered only in the vanishing-memory limit.</p>

            <h2>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piotr Sierant, Jofre Vallès-Muns, Artur Garcia-Saez</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( this https URL ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>In many-body quantum systems, interactions drive the emergence of correlations that are at the heart of the most intriguing states of matter. A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations.</p>

            <p>The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c > 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors - atomically thin crystalline materials that can be stacked into more complex heterostructures - have opened a promising avenue for superconducting electronics thanks to their properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain in other superconducting materials. These include strong resilience to high in-plane fields, electrostatic tuneability, and non-reciprocal transport rooted in inversion-symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition to highlighting the importance of these properties for superconducting electronics, this review gives an overview over the physical mechanisms that govern and influence superconductivity in vdW materials including Ising pairing, band inversion, and proximity effects at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces that do not have an equivalent in thin-film systems. This overview then sets the basis to survey the wide range of functionalities enabled by superconducting vdW devices including gate-controlled devices, superconducting diodes, and circuit elements for readout and control of quantum bits. The review concludes with a forward look at wafer-scale growth and deterministic assembly of vdW devices, highlighting concrete pathways that can enable the transition from vdW device prototypes to deployable components for cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies.</p>

Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the spin splitting of the Kondo resonance, whose spatial distribution sensitively captures the symmetry of the underlying altermagnetic order. Furthermore, the impurity spin correlations reflects the anisotropy of the RKKY interaction due to the altermagnetic Fermi surface splitting. This work provides a framework for studying the competition between the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction and altermagnetism, in the simplest possible system.</p>

            <h2>Derivation and Analysis of Amplitude Equation for Generalized AMB+ in Presence of Chemical Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayantan Mondal, Prasenjit Das</p>
            <p>We derive and analyze the amplitude equation for the roll patterns in case of generalized Active Model B+ (AMB+) in the presence of chemical reactions. The generalized AMB+ differs from the original AMB+ introduced by Tjhung \textit{et al.} [E. Tjhung \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X \textbf{8}, 031080 (2018)] by the addition of a quadratic term, $g\phi^2$, in the expression for the equilibrium part of the current. Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $\lambda$ and a rotational current of strength $\xi$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $\Gamma$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $\Gamma_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $\lambda$, and $\xi$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters. Further, we derive the condition for the \textit{Eckhaus instability} from the stability analysis of the amplitude equation as well as from the phase diffusion equation, and find that it is independent of $g$.</p>

            <p>Self-oscillations of the magnetization due to self-induced torque (SIT) in a magnetic double tunnel junction that consists of perpendicularly polarized, pinned and free layers is investigated along with the field-like torque (FLT). The associated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is numerically analysed to exhibit the oscillations of magnetization driven by the current. From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT.</p>

Remarkably, the K-containing compound exhibits two distinct transition temperatures, corresponding to two separate sets of bilayer-split bands, as evidenced by temperature-dependent superconducting gap and spectral weight near the Fermi energy, while its Cs counterpart displays conventional single transition behavior. These experimental observations are well described by the weakly coupled two-band model of Eilenberger theory, which identifies suppressed interband pairing interactions between the bilayer-split bands as the key mechanism. By exploring quantum phenomena in the weak-coupling limit within a multiband system, our findings pave the way for engineering exotic superconductivity via band-selective pairing control.</p>

Our first-principles calculations identify YbSb$_2$ as a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological metal hosting a Dirac nodal line near the Fermi level. Symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg Landau framework indicates an internally antisymmetric nonunitary triplet (INT) state as the most probable superconducting ground state. Calculations based on an effective low-energy model further demonstrate that this INT state hosts gapless Majorana surface modes, establishing YbSb$_2$ as a topological superconductor. Our results highlight YbSb$_2$ as a unique material platform where type-I superconductivity coexists with triplet-pairing and nontrivial topology.</p>

However, this cAFM nanofabrication process can only occur in the air, with simultaneous device decay described under the "water-cycle" writing mechanism. These restrictions pose ongoing challenges for device optimization in the quantum regime at mK temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a "waterless" cAFM lithography approach that is compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments. Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm. Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides.</p>

            <p>Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</p>

In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice.

            <p>Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</p>

            <p>Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.</p>

We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.</p>

            <p>We derive a framework for classifying topological bands in three-dimensional photonic band structures, where the zero frequency polarization singularity implied by Maxwell's equations complicates the direct application of existing symmetry-based approaches. Building on recent advances in the regularization of photonic bands, we use the recently introduced concept of stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) to show how photonic band structures can be unambiguously characterized in terms of equivalence classes of band representations. We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.</p>

            <h2>Comminution as a Non-Hermitian Quantum Field Theory: Log-Size Jump Generators, Branching Embeddings, and the Airy Solvable Sector</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan J. Segura</p>
            <p>Pure-breakage population balance equations (PBEs) give the standard deterministic description of fragmentation and comminution. They predict mean particle size distributions, but they do not determine fluctuations, size-size correlations, or universality under coarse-graining. We develop a field-theoretic framework anchored in the PBE kernel inputs (selection rate and daughter distribution) and compatible with the stochastic Doi-Peliti approach. From homogeneous kernels we derive an exact Markov jump generator in log-size for a mass-weighted (tagged-mass) distribution, with a jump law that is a probability density fixed by the daughter distribution. The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian qLDPC: TQFT Formalism, Addressable Gauging Measurement and Application to Magic State Fountain on 2D Product Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanyu Zhu, Ryohei Kobayashi, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincaré CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.</p>

            <p>The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</p>

            <h2>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanshi Yang (Northwood High School)</p>
            <p>The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Le Houx</p>
            <p>The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ademola Soyemi, Tibor Szilvasi</p>
            <p>The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.</p>

            <h2>Approximate FKG inequalities for phase-bound spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyaki Mukherjee, Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization. In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model.</p>

            <h2>Simulated Annealing-based Candidate Optimization for Batch Acquisition Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Md Ahnaf Akif Alvi, Raymundo Arróyave, Douglas Allaire</p>
            <p>Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Marcolli, Martin James, Agnese Seminara</p>
            <p>We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.</p>

            <p>Coherence transfer is a multi-disciplinary topic of interest, including chemistry, biology and physics. In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\,\mu$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures.</p>

In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.</p>

We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</p>

Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.</p>

            <p>Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates.</p>

            <p>We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</p>

            <h2>Radiation-induced Instability of Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</h2>

            <p>Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic theory of phonon polaritons and long wavelength dielectric response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olle Hellman, Leeor Kronik</p>
            <p>We present a first-principles approach for calculating phonon-polariton dispersion relations. In this approach, phonon-photon interaction is described by quantization of a Hamiltonian that describes harmonic lattice vibrations coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the material. All Hamiltonian parameters are obtained from first-principles calculations, with diagonalization leading to non-interacting polariton quasiparticles. This method naturally includes retardation effects and resolves non-analytical behavior and ambiguities in phonon frequencies at the Brillouin zone center, especially in non-cubic and optically anisotropic materials. Furthermore, by incorporating higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian, we also account for quasiparticle interactions and spectral broadening. Specifically, we show how anharmonic effects in phonon polaritons lead to a dielectric response that challenges traditional models. The accuracy and consequences of the approach are demonstrated on GaP and GaN as harmonic test systems and PbTe and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as anharmonic test systems.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. W. González, T. Brumme, E. Suárez Morell, A. M. León</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>We present the results of an experimental investigation into buoyant rigid spheres rising through highly concentrated collections of hydrated hydrogel particles. The volume fraction of particles is such that the mechanical properties of the material are intermediate between a very viscous fluid and a soft solid. Despite the established time dependent, non-Newtonian character of hydrogels, we find that when the surface of the material is free, an immersed buoyant sphere rises with a constant speed. The effects of the motion are observed to be highly localized around the sphere. When the stress exerted on the material is changed by varying the mass of the sphere, its terminal velocity is found to depend exponentially on its buoyancy. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found when a solid lid is placed on the surface of the material. In this case, a seemingly thixotropic, sublinear time-dependent motion is found. It is observed that linear motion of the sphere is accompanied by flow at the surface of the material whereas fluid movement is suppressed when a lid is present. We use these observations to provide a hypothesis which links the exponential stress dependence of the rheology of the material to the effects of the boundary conditions on the kinematics of the intruder.</p>

            <h2>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Weberszpil, Ralf Metzler</p>
            <p>We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</p>

            <p>We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged CF Hilbert space, with the trace-condition term emerging naturally in the small-$q$ limit as part of the CF Hamiltonian. Going beyond the small-$q$ limit, we apply our theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ and calculate its CF band structures. The resulting CF phase diagram matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter. Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a single inertial probe driven into a nonequilibrium steady-state by random collisions with self-propelled active walkers. The probe and walkers are confined within a gravitational harmonic potential. We evaluate the robustness of the effective temperature concept in this active system by comparing values of distinct, independently motivated definitions: a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation, a kinetic temperature, and a work fluctuation relation. Our experiments reveal that, under specific conditions, these independent measurements yield a remarkably consistent effective temperature over a wide range of system configurations. Furthermore, we also identify regimes where this consistency breaks down, which delineates the fundamental limits of extending equilibrium-like thermodynamic concepts to athermal, actively driven systems.</p>

            <h2>Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wouter Buijsman</p>
            <p>The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlevé differential equation is solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry (provided that the time-reversal operator squares to the identity matrix). A Wigner surmise-inspired analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.</p>

            <p>Free gasses of spinless fermions moving on a lattice-symmetric geometric background are considered. Their topological properties at zero temperature can be used to classify their Fermi seas and associated boundaries. The flat orbifolds ${\Rb}^{d}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space, are used to accomplish this task. Two topological classes exist for $d=1$: an interval, which is identified as a conductor, and a circumference, which corresponds to an insulator. The number of topological classes increases to 17 for $d=2$: 8 have the topology of a disk, that are generally recognized as conductors, and 4 correspond to a 2-sphere, matching insulators. Both sets eventually contain a finite number of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The remaining cases in the listing relate to conductors (annulus, Möbius strip) and insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle). Examples that fall under this list are given, along with physical interpretations of the singularities. It is anticipated that the findings of this classification will be robust under perturbative interactions due to its topological character.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elmeri O. Rivasto</p>
            <p>A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.</p>

            <h2>Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</p>

            <p>Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments. Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity to match with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave planar resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to $2.57 \cdot 10^{-7} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $2.87 \cdot 10^{-8} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.</p>

Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</p>

            <p>The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds to the "natural" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switch the Néel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.</p>

We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.</p>

            <p>Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remain not fully elucidated. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with different levels of porosity, achieved by simulating structural models with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal the interplay between pore size and accessibility and the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity (480 and 310 mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.</p>

We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture gets altered, when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states.

We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear advective coefficient of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find an excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath particles during two-body scattering.</p>

The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point of the energy functional -- the critical droplet or instanton -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations about this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial-value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for critical droplets close to the coexistence line, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and predict its signature in experimental images of a nucleating gas, increasing the rigor of comparisons between nucleation theory and experiment.</p>

            <p>Understanding how interparticle interactions govern phase behavior is central to controlling self-organization in multicomponent soft-matter systems. In particular, the role of cross-interactions between unlike components remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate how cross-interaction character controls phase behavior in binary mixtures of hard and soft particles using coarse-grained modeling, Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. Four representative systems are examined that differ only in whether interactions between unlike particles are bounded or hard-sphere. We show that penetrable (bounded) cross-interactions are both necessary and sufficient to induce microphase separation, even in the absence of attractive forces. Such systems exhibit dispersed states, macrophase separation, and microphase-separated morphologies characterized by finite-wavelength compositional ordering. In contrast, purely hard-sphere cross interactions suppress microphase separation entirely, despite strong local clustering. Comparison between theory and simulations reveals qualitative agreement in phase topology, while simulations additionally capture hierarchical and multiscale ordering near crossover regimes. These findings establish cross-interaction softness as a fundamental design principle for controlling phase behavior in multicomponent colloidal and soft-matter systems.</p>

            <p>Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of the group representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations were performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with wave vector q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 302 materials. Our method successfully identified the magnetic structures for 212 of these materials. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,900 magnetic materials. To demonstrate the utility of our database, we apply it to the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, leading to the identification of 1,070 and 392 instances, respectively.</p>

In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively escape local minima defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the target local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.</p>

Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.</p>

            <h2>Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul L. Ebert, Yasir Iqbal, Alexander Wietek</p>
            <p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Philipp Stürmer, Stephanie Reimann</p>
            <p>Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, rather than the interparticle interactions, can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting superradiance dynamics from single diamond nanocrystals with a physically consistent model for fluorescence decay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub J. Borkowski, Artur Czerwinski, Piotr Kolenderski</p>
            <p>The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition in a context-sensitive random language model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuma Toji, Jun Takahashi, Vwani Roychowdhury, Hideyuki Miyahara</p>
            <p>Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades. The recent rise of large language models has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities. However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking. In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics, we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context-sensitive grammars, which we call the context-sensitive random language model, and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model. We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly zero to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider. Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase. This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but are generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</p>
