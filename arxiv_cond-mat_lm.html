            <h2>Quantum entanglement of XY-type spin dimers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianli Ma, Brianna R. Billingsley, Madalynn Marshall, David A. Dahlbom, Yiqing Hao, Daniel M.Pajerowski, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Xiaojian Bai, Cristian D. Batista, Tai Kong, Huibo Cao</p>
            <p>We report a comprehensive study on the origin of the enigmatic disordered ground state within the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$, at low temperatures. The magnetization and heat capacity data show a lack of magnetic ordering down to 73 mK. We deploy a localized spin dimer model which can accurately reproduce the dynamic structure factor of the neutron data, magnetization and heat capacity data. Remarkably, the intra-dimer exchange interaction shows strong XY-type anisotropy and the ground state of BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$ is in an entangled state $(|\uparrow\uparrow> - |\downarrow\downarrow>)/\sqrt{2}$. This is in contrast to the singlet dimer state that is obtained for Heisenberg interactions. These results confirm that BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$ is in a quantum paramagnet state consisting of entangled spin dimer states.</p>

            <h2>Entropy spectroscopy of a bilayer graphene quantum dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christoph Adam, Hadrien Duprez, Natalie Lehmann, Antoni Yglesias, Solenn Cances, Max Josef Ruckriegel, Michele Masseroni, Chuyao Tong, Artem Olegovich Denisov, Wei Wister Huang, David Kealhofer, Rebekka Garreis, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Klaus Ensslin, Thomas Ihn</p>
            <p>We measure the entropy change of charge transitions in an electrostatically defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene. Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a two-fold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a three-fold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our work demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices build in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van der Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent discovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such materials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine magnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many challenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic materials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their often-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization dynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and facilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing synthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale, high-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be used for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials provides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of new phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap presents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for various relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis, characterization, and applications. We hope that this work can provide a strong starting point for young researchers in the field and provide a general overview of the key challenges for more experienced researchers.</p>

            <h2>$N$-photon bundles emission in high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huanhuan Wei, Jing Tang, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>High-spin quantum systems, endowed with rich internal degrees of freedom, constitute a promising platform for manipulating high-quality $n$-photon states. In this study, we explore $n$-photon bundles emission by constructing a high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) within a single-mode cavity interacting with a single spin-$3/2$ atom. Our analysis reveals that the $n$-photon dressed state splittings can be significantly enhanced by adjusting the linear Zeeman shift inherent to the internal degrees of freedom in high-spin systems, thereby yielding well-resolved $n$-photon resonance. The markedly enhanced energy-spectrum anharmonicity, stemming from strong nonlinearities, enables the realization of high-quality $n$-photon bundles emission with large steady-state photon numbers, in contrast to conventional spin-1/2 JCM setups. Of particular interest is the realization of an optical multimode transducer capable of transitioning among single-photon blockade, two- to four-photon bundles emission, and photon-induced tunneling by tuning the light-cavity detuning in the presence of both cavity and atomic pump fields. This work unveils significant opportunities for diverse applications in nonclassical all-optical switching and high-quality multiphoton sources, deepening our understanding of creating specialized nonclassical states and fundamental physics in high-spin atom-cavity systems.</p>

Energy relaxation is provided by inelastic photon scattering on a two-dimensional electron gas in magnetic field.

            <h2>Phase Diagram and Spectroscopic Signatures of Supersolids in Quantum Ising Magnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$</h2>

            <p>A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter that exhibits the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. \red{While theoretical studies have predicted that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can host a supersolid phase, experimental validation has remained elusive. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spins, we investigate the supersolid phase in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$.} Here, we present the magnetic phase diagram and neutron scattering results for K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, which features nearest-neighbor Ising-like interactions with $J_z = 2.96(2)$ meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$ meV. In zero field, neutron spectroscopy reveals the gradual development of a quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with Z$_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) below 15 K. \red{At temperatures below 0.3 K, the fully developed supersolid phase is evidenced by the coexistence of a gapless Goldstone mode arising from broken U$(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (superfluidity), and a gapped pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with lifted accidental XY degeneracy (solidity).} In $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields 1.1 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T, a prominent 1/3 magnetization plateau phase emerges, accompanied by a \red{plausible} high-field supersolid phase (17 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T). Our results establish K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$as an exceptional realization of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice quantum Ising magnet, document its magnetic phase diagram featuring two supersolid phases, and uncover spectroscopic \red{signatures} of zero-field supersolidity in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet.</p>

            <h2>Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kelvin Dsouza, Patrick Del Vecchio, Nicolas Rotaru, Oussama Moutanabbir, Daryoosh Vashaee</p>
            <p>This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</p>

            <h2>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

            <h2>$N$-photon bundles emission in high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huanhuan Wei, Jing Tang, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>High-spin quantum systems, endowed with rich internal degrees of freedom, constitute a promising platform for manipulating high-quality $n$-photon states. In this study, we explore $n$-photon bundles emission by constructing a high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) within a single-mode cavity interacting with a single spin-$3/2$ atom. Our analysis reveals that the $n$-photon dressed state splittings can be significantly enhanced by adjusting the linear Zeeman shift inherent to the internal degrees of freedom in high-spin systems, thereby yielding well-resolved $n$-photon resonance. The markedly enhanced energy-spectrum anharmonicity, stemming from strong nonlinearities, enables the realization of high-quality $n$-photon bundles emission with large steady-state photon numbers, in contrast to conventional spin-1/2 JCM setups. Of particular interest is the realization of an optical multimode transducer capable of transitioning among single-photon blockade, two- to four-photon bundles emission, and photon-induced tunneling by tuning the light-cavity detuning in the presence of both cavity and atomic pump fields. This work unveils significant opportunities for diverse applications in nonclassical all-optical switching and high-quality multiphoton sources, deepening our understanding of creating specialized nonclassical states and fundamental physics in high-spin atom-cavity systems.</p>

            <h2>Uniquely identifying quantum Hall phases in charge neutral graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jincheng An, Ganpathy Murthy</p>
            <p>Charge-neutral graphene in the quantum Hall regime is an example of a quantum Hall ferromagnet in a complex spin-valley space. This system exhibits a plethora of phases, with the particular spin-valley order parameters chosen by the system depending sensitively on the short-range anisotropic couplings, the Zeeman field, and the sublattice symmetry breaking field. A subset of order parameters related to lattice symmetry-breaking have been observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, other order parameters, particularly those which superpose spin and valley, are more elusive, making it difficult to pin down the nature of the phase. We propose a solution this problem by examining two types of experimentally measurable quantities; transport gaps and collective mode dispersions. We find that the variation of the transport gap with the Zeeman and sublattice symmetry breaking fields, in conjunction with the number of Larmor and gapless modes, provides a unique signature for each theoretically possible phase.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Anharmonic Effects on the Superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S at High Pressures: a First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pugeng Hou, Francesco Belli, Tiange Bi, Eva Zurek, Ion Errea</p>
            <p>Making use of first-principles calculations we analyze the effect of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S, one of the lowest enthalpy structures in the C-S-H system, in the 150-300 GPa pressure range within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict a correction to the crystal structure, which is formed by an H3S lattice and CH4 molecules, the phonon spectra, and the pressure-dependent superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Our results show that quantum ionic fluctuations have an impact on the distance between H atoms and S atoms in the H3S host lattice, pushing it towards more symmetric bonds, while the methane molecules are barely affected. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure is dynamically stable above 150 GPa, which is 30 GPa lower than the pressure at which the harmonic approximation predicts the emergence of an instability. As a consequence of the strong anharmonic enhancement of the phonon frequencies, the electron-phonon coupling constant is suppressed by 46% at 200 GPa, and even more at lower pressures. As a result, the superconducting critical temperature is overestimated by around 50 K at 200 GPa, such that it falls below 150 K in the whole pressure range studied. Our results underline that ternary hydrides are subject to strong anharmonic effects on their structural, vibrational, and superconducting properties.</p>

            <h2>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Kun Jiang, Fu-Chun Zhang</p>
            <p>The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter that exhibits the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. \red{While theoretical studies have predicted that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can host a supersolid phase, experimental validation has remained elusive. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spins, we investigate the supersolid phase in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$.} Here, we present the magnetic phase diagram and neutron scattering results for K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, which features nearest-neighbor Ising-like interactions with $J_z = 2.96(2)$ meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$ meV. In zero field, neutron spectroscopy reveals the gradual development of a quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with Z$_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) below 15 K. \red{At temperatures below 0.3 K, the fully developed supersolid phase is evidenced by the coexistence of a gapless Goldstone mode arising from broken U$(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (superfluidity), and a gapped pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with lifted accidental XY degeneracy (solidity).} In $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields 1.1 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T, a prominent 1/3 magnetization plateau phase emerges, accompanied by a \red{plausible} high-field supersolid phase (17 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T). Our results establish K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$as an exceptional realization of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice quantum Ising magnet, document its magnetic phase diagram featuring two supersolid phases, and uncover spectroscopic \red{signatures} of zero-field supersolidity in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet.</p>

            <p>This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasufumi Nakano, Olivier Bleu, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish</p>
            <p>We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. We show that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. Furthermore, we show that this light enhancement is sensitive to the dipole moment and is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions. Our results reveal the role of dark exciton states in dipolariton interactions as well as the optimal bilayer properties for achieving strong interactions.</p>

            <h2>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Ghafari Cherati, Anton Pershin, Ádám Gali</p>
            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <p>Cavity magnomechanics is one important hybrid magnonic platform that focuses on the coherent interaction between magnons and phonons. The resulting magnon polarons inherit the intrinsic properties of both magnons and phonons, combining their individual advantages and enabling new physics and functionalities. But in previous demonstrations the magnon-phonon coupling either have limited bandwidth or cannot be efficiently accessed. In this work, we show that by utilizing the slow-wave hybrid magnonics configuration based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs), the coherent magnon-phonon interaction can be efficiently observed over a frequency range larger than 7 GHz on a YIG thin film device. In particular, the capability of the SSPPs in exciting short-wavelength magnons reveals a novel size effect when the magnons are coupled with high-over tone bulk acoustic resonances. Our work paves the way towards novel magnomechanical devices.</p>

            <h2>Photocurrent Enhancement due to Spin-Exchange Carrier Multiplication in Films of Manganese-Doped 'Inverted' CdSe/HgSe Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungchul Noh, Clément Livache, Donghyo Hahm, Valerio Pinchetti, Ho Jin, Changjo Kim, Victor I. Klimov</p>
            <p>Incorporation of manganese impurities into II-VI semiconductors results in a dramatic change in their properties due to strong exchange interactions between the Mn ion and the semiconductor host. In colloidal quantum dots (QDs), these interactions result in a rapid bidirectional energy transfer between the magnetic impurity and the QD intrinsic states, which is characterized by an extremely high energy transfer rate of more than ~5 eV/ps. This rate is higher than the rate of energy loss due to phonon emission (typically, ~1 eV/ps or less), so Mn-QD interactions could in principle be used to capture and utilize the kinetic energy of the hot carrier before it is lost to phonons. Here, we demonstrate that by using Mn-doped CdSe/HgSe core/shell QDs, we can efficiently convert the kinetic energy of a hot exciton into an additional electron-hole pair (exciton). This carrier multiplication process occurs through rapid capture of a hot exciton by a Mn ion, which then undergoes spin flip relaxation, producing two excitons near the QD band edge. Due to the inverted geometry of the CdSe/HgSe QDs, both electrons and holes resulting from carrier multiplication occupy the QD shell, allowing them to be easily extracted from the QD for potential use in electro-optical devices or chemical reactions.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic effects on infrared vibrational and Raman spectroscopy from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Hao Chan, Zhenglu Li, Steven G. Louie</p>
            <p>We develop a first-principles approach to compute infrared (IR) vibrational absorption and Raman scattering spectra with excitonic effects included. Our method is based on a perturbative expansion of electron-phonon and electron-light couplings in the time-dependent adiabatic GW (TD-aGW) theory. We show that excitonic effects in the IR absorption spectrum can be included by replacing the free electron-hole propagators in the perturbative expression for independent particles with their interacting counterparts, which are readily available from standard GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations. For Raman spectrum, our derived expression agrees with the single and double resonance terms from a diagrammatic approach. We show significant excitonic enhancement in both the IR and resonance Raman scattering intensity for monolayer MoS2, WS2, and WSe2. Moreover, the exciton-phonon coupling strength and exciton energy landscape can be accessed by analyzing resonance Raman spectrum of these materials.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. We show the linearly (circularly) polarized light can generate injection (shift) current in the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction when the Néel vector points in an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current does not depend\ on the frequency $% \omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $% \varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}\leq \hbar \omega \leq \hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.</p>

            <p>A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire based Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-TC) superconductivity. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial ultrathin films. Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 single-phase-crystalline films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Resistivity measurements and magnetic-field responses indicate onset TC = 45 K. The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8.5 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) show that the films maintain a tetragonal phase with coherent epitaxial compressive strain ~2% in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature through strain engineering in heterostructures.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and band topology is expected to uncover numerous novel physical phenomena. However, the majority of research has focused on periodic crystalline structures, with comparatively fewer studies exploring quasicrystalline systems. In this paper, we delve into the influence of asymmetric hopping on the topological insulators, specifically focusing on quantum spin Hall insulators and higher-order topological insulators in an octagonal Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. We demonstrate that asymmetric hopping can significantly alter the distribution of edge states, leading to a uniform distribution across all boundaries or localizing them at a single edge, depending on the symmetry adjustments. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of higher-order topological corner states under perturbations, showing that these states can maintain their distribution even in the presence of non-Hermiticity. Our findings not only expand the current understanding of topological states in quasicrystals under non-Hermitian conditions, but also provide valuable theoretical guidance for manipulating corner state distributions in non-Hermitian quasicrystalline higher-order topological insulators.</p>

            <p>Active systems comprising micron-sized self-propelling units, also termed microswimmers, are promising candidates for the bottom-up assembly of small structures and reconfigurable materials. Here we leverage field-driven colloidal assembly to induce structural transformations in dense layers of microswimmers driven by an alternating current (AC) electric field and confined in a microfabricated trap under the influence of gravity. By varying the electric field frequency, we realize significant structural transformations, from a gas-like state at high frequencies to dynamically rearranging dense crystalline clusters at lower frequencies, characterized by vorticity in their dynamics. We demonstrate the ability to switch between these states on-demand, showing that the clustering mechanism differs from motility-induced phase separation. Our results offer a valuable framework for designing high-density active matter systems with controllable structural properties, envisioned to advance the development of artificial materials with self-healing and reconfiguration capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irea Mosquera-Lois, Johan Klarbring, Aron Walsh</p>
            <p>Point defects dictate the properties of many functional materials. The standard approach to modelling the thermodynamics of defects relies on a static description, where the change in Gibbs free energy is approximated by the internal energy. This approach has a low computational cost, but ignores contributions from atomic vibrations and structural configurations that can be accessed at finite temperatures. We train a machine learning force field (MLFF) to explore dynamic defect behaviour using $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ and $\textit{V}{\mathrm{_{Te}^{+2}}}$ in CdTe as exemplars. We consider the different entropic contributions (e.g., electronic, spin, vibrational, orientational, and configurational) and compare methods to compute the defect free energies, ranging from a harmonic treatment to a fully anharmonic approach based on thermodynamic integration. We find that metastable configurations are populated at room temperature and thermal effects increase the predicted concentration of $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ by two orders of magnitude -- and can thus significantly affect the predicted properties. Overall, our study underscores the importance of finite-temperature effects and the potential of MLFFs to model defect dynamics at both synthesis and device operating temperatures.</p>

In the presence of an edge it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle modes can be distinguished as edge modes and bulk modes, which appear at different energies. The bulk-edge correspondence is obtained by an analytic continuation from the in-gap edge modes to the bands of bulk modes. By varying the energy we find a transition from localized edge modes to delocalized bulk modes. We calculate the quasiparticle currents, discuss briefly how these currents couple to external currents, and predict how this can be used to control the quasiparticle modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Qi, Karin M. Rabe</p>
            <p>We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We show that 6 of these 7 remaining structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (o-FE), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (o-FE2), and and monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.</p>

            <p>Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</p>

            <h2>The Interplay Between Electron Localization, Magnetic Order, and Jahn-Teller Distortion that Dictates LiMnO$_2$ Phase Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronald L. Kam, Luca Binci, Aaron D. Kaplan, Kristin A. Persson, Nicola Marzari, Gerbrand Ceder</p>
            <p>The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with extended Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V) that are self-consistently determined, the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases (around 5.8 eV) are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures (around 6.4 eV). The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps > 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism and Strain Induced Altermagnetic Transition in Cairo Pentagonal Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyi Li, Yu Zhang, Adrian Bahri, Xiaoliang Zhang, Chunjing Jia</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered class of magnetic order characterized by vanishing net magnetization and spin-splitting band structures, has garnered significant research attention. In this work, we introduce a novel two-dimensional system that exhibits $g$-wave altermagnetism and undergoes a strain-induced transition from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism. This system can be realized in an unconventional monolayer Cairo pentagonal lattice, for which we present a realistic tight-binding model that incorporates both magnetic and non-magnetic sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-trivial band topology can emerge in this system by breaking the symmetry that protects the spin-polarized nodal points. Finally, \emph{ab initio} calculations on several candidate materials, such as FeS$_2$ and Nb$_2$FeB$_2$, which exhibit symmetry consistent with the proposed tight-binding Hamiltonian, are also presented. These findings open new avenues for exploring spintronic devices based on altermagnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic structure of polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ with N\'eel-type skyrmion lattice probed by $^{51}$V NMR</h2>

            <p>We report the magnetization and the $^{51}$V NMR measurements in the polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ in which a magnetic skyrmion lattice appears in the structural domain with the polar axis parallel to the magnetic field. Although we successfully separate the $^{51}$V NMR signals in the domain from those in the other structural domains, only the high-frequency region of NMR spectrum is observed due to a significant increase of the spin-echo decay rate in the low-frequency region. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[111]$, we find the NMR signals from the supermagnetized cycloidal state in the parallel domains as well as from the conical state in domains where the polar axis is tilted from the magnetic field. No NMR signal from the skyrmion lattice state is observed, suggesting a significant increase of the decay rate by additional low-energy excitations caused by dynamics of the skyrmions. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[001]$, where all the structural domains are magnetically equivalent, multiple NMR peaks converge into one peak at the saturation magnetic field. This field dependence is explained by the closing of magnetic cones as approaching the forced-ferromagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Flat electronic bands in condensed matter provide a rich avenue for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we report an optical spectroscopy study of a topological hourglass semimetal Nb3SiTe6 with the electric field of the incident light parallel to its crystalline ab-plane. The ab-plane optical conductivity spectra of Nb3SiTe6 single crystals exhibit a remarkable peak-like feature around 1.20 eV, which is mainly contributed by the direct optical transitions between the two ab-initio-calculation-derived flat bands along the momentum direction Z-U. Our results pave the way for investigating exotic quantum phenomena based on the flat bands in topological hourglass semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Axion insulator, Weyl points, quantum anomalous Hall effect and magnetic topological phase transition in Eu3In2As4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyu Yao, Ruihan Zhang, Sheng Zhang, Haohao Sheng, Youguo Shi, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Zhijun Wang</p>
            <p>The magnetic topological phases attract much interest, such as the axion insulator, higher-order topology, Weyl semimetals, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Here, we predict that the axion insulator phase, magnetic Weyl points, and QAHE can be achieved in Eu3In2As4. Recently, the single-crystal Eu3In2As4 has been successfully synthesized, which exhibits an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Our first-principles calculations show that it lies on the phase boundary between multiple magnetic topological phases, and the magnetic anisotropy is weak, with an energy difference less than 1 meV. In the AFM state, it can be tuned to an axion insulator by tensile strain. The quantized axion angle $\theta = \pi$ and the magnetic higher-order topology are characterized by the parity index $Z_4 = 2$. By applying an external magnetic field, the induced ferromagnetic (FM) state becomes an ideal magnetic topological semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points or a nodal ring. The QAHE can be achieved in FM multilayer films of Eu3In2As4 on a magnetic insulating substrate.</p>

            <h2>Capturing thin-film microstructure contributions during ultrafast laser-metal interactions using atomistic simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hariprasath Ganesan, Stefan Sandfeld</p>
            <p>Progress in the emerging fields of atomic and close-to-atomic scale manufacturing is underpinned by enhanced precision and optimization of laser-controlled nanostructuring. Understanding thin films' crystallographic orientations and microstructure effects becomes crucial for optimizing the laser-metallic thin film interactions; however, these effects remain largely unexplored at the atomic scale. Using a hybrid two-temperature model and molecular dynamics, we simulated ultrafast laser-metal interactions for gold thin films with varying crystallographic orientations and microstructure configurations. Microstructure features, namely grain size, grain topology, and local crystallographic orientation, controlled the rate and extent of lattice disorder evolution and phase transformation, particularly at lower applied fluences. Our simulations provided comprehensive insights encompassing both the nanomechanical and thermodynamic aspects of ultrafast laser-metal interactions at atomic resolution. Microstructure-aware/informed thin film fabrication and targeted defect engineering could improve the precision of nanoscale laser processing and potentially emerge as an energy-efficient optimization strategy.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Manipulation of Spin Splitting Torque in Altermagnetic RuO2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichi Zhang, Hua Bai, Lei Han, Jiankun Dai, Chong Chen, Shixuan Liang, Yanzhang Cao, Yingying Zhang, Qian Wang, Wenxuan Zhu, Feng Pan, Cheng Song</p>
            <p>Due to nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE), altermagnets can generate time-reversal-odd spin current and spin splitting torque (SST) with spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Hence the effective manipulation of SST would provide plenty of opportunities for designable spintronic devices, which remains elusive. Here, the electrical control of SST is achieved in altermagnetic RuO2, based on controllable Néel vector of RuO2 and Néel vector-dependent generation of SST. We demonstrate the current-induced switching of Néel vector via spin-orbit torque in RuO2 films, according to the reversible polarity of electrical transport measurements and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). The XMLD also unprecedentedly demonstrates that Néel vector really exists in altermagnets. The switching of Néel vector to the current direction and resultantly enhanced spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector brings about stronger ASSE-induced spin current. Our findings not only enrich the properties of altermagnets but also pave the way for high speed memories and nano-oscillators with excellent controllability and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Electron-Magnon Interaction-Induced Topological Phase Transition in Magnetic Weyl Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Sourounis, Aurélien Manchon</p>
            <p>Despite the tremendous interest raised by the recent realization of magnetic Weyl semimetals and the observation of giant anomalous Hall signals, most of the theories used to interpret experimental data overlook the magnetic fluctuations, which are ubiquitous in such materials and can massively impact topological and transport properties. In this work, we predict that in such magnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons substantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase transition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl nodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find that Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon interactions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating the resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open perspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl semimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature.</p>

Our results for the ground state energy $B_N$ and size $R_N$ improve previously known large-$N$ asymptotes and we better understand the crossover to the few-body regime. The oscillatory breathing motion results from the quantum-mechanical breaking of the mean-field scaling symmetry.

            <p>Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a procedure for constructing a maximally localized Wannier basis for a subspace of bands with a non-zero Chern number. Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we analyze the limits of using the projection procedure to obtain a Wannierizable subspace from a set of topologically obstructed bands. The Wannier functions from this subspace form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. We consider the Haldane tight-binding model in the Chern phase as the platform for our investigation.</p>

            <p>We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</p>

            <h2>Supercell Wannier Functions and Emergent Kondo Lattices in Topological Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Monsen, Martin Claassen</p>
            <p>Conventional theories for Mott insulators involve well-localized electronic orbitals. This picture fails in the presence of topological obstructions in Chern bands which prevent the formation of exponentially localized orbitals and are instead often viewed by analogy to Landau levels. Here, we show that strong interactions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott insulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be naturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized orbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a gauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which segregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier orbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as an itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological obstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study fractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3 filling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can stabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken translation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional Chern insulating states. Our results predict a new scenario for time-reversal-symmetric interacting topological bands in solids, beyond conventional Landau level paradigms for the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ultrafast structural dynamics of LaAlO3 thin films driven by short mid-infrared laser pulses at 20 THz. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals an immediate lattice expansion and an acoustic breathing mode of the film. First-principles theory and a spring-mass model identify the direct coupling between coherently driven infrared-active phonons and strain as the underlying mechanism. Time-resolved optical birefringence measurements confirm that the amplitude of this acoustic mode scales linearly with the pump fluence, which agrees with the theory. Furthermore, time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering indicates that THz excitation enhances crystallinity by inducing a non-thermal increase in structural symmetry originating from preexisting defects. These findings highlight the potential of a multimodal approach-combining time-resolved X-ray and optical measurements and first-principles theory-to elucidate and control structural dynamics in nanoscale materials.</p>

NaAlSi and NaAlGe are similar topological nodal-line semimetals, but they have distinct properties. NaAlSi is a superconductor at 6.8 K, whereas NaAlGe is an insulator with a pseudogap of approximately 100 K. Using the potassium-indium flux method, we succeeded in synthesizing a single crystal of KAlGe, a new anti-PbFCl compound. First principles electronic structure calculations reveal that KAlGe is isoelectronic with NaAlSi and NaAlGe. KAlGe undergoes a metal-to-metal transition at 89 K and exhibits no superconductivity above 1.8 K. The low temperature phase has significantly lower carrier density and extremely high mobility, similar to Dirac electron systems. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction experiments show a structural change that breaks the fourfold symmetry during the phase transition. Electron-phonon interactions may be responsible for superconductivity in NaAlSi, whereas excitonic electron-hole interactions are thought to play an important role in KAlGe and possibly NaAlGe. Our findings demonstrate that fascinating physics lies within the compound family.</p>

            <p>Large, high-purity single-crystals of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are essential for exploiting its many desirable and interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy that h-BN crystals can be grown by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ). The diameters of grown boules range from 3 -- 5 mm with lengths from 2 -- 7 mm. Tomography indicates variable grain sizes within the boules, with the largest having areas of $\approx$ 1 mm $\times$ 2 mm and thickness $\approx$ 0.5 mm. Although the boules contain macroscale flux inclusions, the h-BN lattice itself is of high quality for samples grown under optimized conditions. The currently optimized growth procedure employs an Fe flux, moderate N$_2$ pressure ($P_{N2} \approx$ 6 bar), and a growth rate of 0.1 mm/h.Raman spectroscopy for an optimized sample gives an average linewidth of 7.7(2) cm$^{-1}$ for the $E_{2g}$ intralayer mode at 1365.46(4) cm$^{-1}$ and 1.0(1) cm$^{-1}$ for the $E_{2g}$ interlayer shear mode at 51.78(9) cm$^{-1}$. The corresponding photoluminescence spectrum shows sharp phonon-assisted free exciton peaks and minimal signal in the energy range corresponding to carbon-related defects ($E$ = 3.9 -- 4.1 eV). Our work demonstrates the viability of growing h-BN by the TSFZ technique, thereby opening a new route towards larger, high-quality crystals and advancing the state of h-BN related research.</p>

The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</p>

Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system, with a recurrence relation between different system sizes. We solve the degeneracy problem by showing the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain. Mapping the counting problem to a combinatorial one and obtaining the exact generating function, we prove the recurrence relation on both open and periodic chains. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation.</p>

            <p>We consider a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the assisted hopping limit, where direct electron hopping is subdominant. At fixed electron-phonon coupling and in the absence of Coulomb interactions, the model shows a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid in the adiabatic limit and a quantum antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at high phonon frequencies. Here, we show that by adding terms to the model that reinforce the AFM phase, thereby lowering the critical phonon frequency, the quantum phase transition becomes strongly first order. Our results do not depend on the symmetry of the model. In fact, adding a Hubbard-$U$ term to the model lowers the O(4) symmetry of the model to SU(2) such that the DQCP we observe has the same symmetries as other models that account for similar quantum phase transitions.</p>

The new release improves upon version 2.0 through the introduction of several emerging real-time path integral (PI) methods, including fast centroid molecular dynamics (f-CMD) and fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) methods, as well as our recently introduced hybrid CMD (h-CMD) method for the accurate and efficient simulation of vibrational infrared spectra. Several test cases, including liquid bulk water at 300 K and ice Ih at 150 K, are used to showcase the performance of different implemented PI methods in simulating the infrared spectra at both ambient conditions and low temperatures where NQEs become more apparent. Additionally, using different salt-in-water (i.e., dilute) and water-in-salt (i.e., concentrated) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) aqueous electrolyte solutions, we demonstrate the applicability of our recently introduced h-CMD method implemented in DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 for the large scale simulation of IR spectra of complex heterogeneous systems. We show that h-CMD can overcome the curvature problem of CMD and the artificial broadening of T-RPMD for the accurate simulation of the vibrational spectra of complex, heterogeneous systems with NQEs included.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX3-based (X = S, Se) heterostructures</h2>

            <p>Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the explorations of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX3 (X = S, Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting arises in the AA-stacking MnPX3/MPX3 (M = Cd, Mg, Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting emerges in the AB-stacking configurations. Combining MnPX3 and ferroelectric substrates like CuInP2S6 results in switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on band structures, which can be tuned by applying out-of-plane electric fields to non-volatilely reversing the ferroelectric polarization. In summary, our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsically chiral exciton polaritons in an atomically-thin semiconductor</h2>

            <p>Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Emerging Microelectronic Materials by Design: Navigating Combinatorial Design Space with Scarce and Dispersed Data</h2>

            <p>The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate that a spin current can be induced by the acousto-electric evanescent wave, an electric field associated with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) that decay along the surface normal. A previous study showed that a magnetic-field-dependent dc voltage (acoustic voltage) emerges in heavy metal (HM)/ferromagnet (FM) bilayers under excitation of SAWs. The effect, referred to as the acoustic spin Hall effect, was understood by assuming a SAW-induced ac spin current rectified by the oscillation of the FM layer magnetization and the inverse spin Hall effect. However, the mechanism of the spin current generation remained unidentified. Here we measure the acoustic voltage as a function of the SAW propagation direction relative to the crystalline orientation of a LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We find that the magnetic field angle dependence of the acoustic voltage exhibits a phase shift depending on the SAW propagation direction. The result is consistently explained in terms of the acousto-electric evanescent wave generating the spin current in HM layer via the spin Hall effect, thus clarifies the origin of the acoustic spin Hall effect.</p>

A key highlight of this study is the observation of the influence of interactions on the collisional scattering process. We measure the production of scattering halos at different interaction levels by varying the number of particles and the scattering length, and quantitatively assess the applicability of perturbation theory. To delve into a general theory of scattering halos, we introduce a scattering factor and obtain a universal relation between it and the halo ratio. Furthermore, we simulate the formation of scattering halos under non-perturbative conditions and analyze the discrepancies between simulation results and experiments through a return pulse experiment. This study enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying scattering processes in many-body systems and provides new perspectives for further theoretical research.</p>

            <p>The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with Néel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized Néel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernd Aichner, Sandra Keppert, Johannes D. Pedarnig, Wolfgang Lang</p>
            <p>Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Magnetic Field and Temperature on Half Width at Half Maximum of Multi-photon Absorption Spectrum in Two-dimensional Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cao Thi Vi Ba, Nguyen Quang Bau, Nguyen Dinh Nam, Anh-Tuan Tran, Nguyen Thu Huong</p>
            <p>We use the Profile numerical method to calculate the spectral line width, or half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the absorption peaks of multi-photon absorption processes in a two-dimensional graphene system (2DGS) according to important external parameters such as magnetic field and temperature in the presence of strong electromagnetic waves (SEMW). The appearance of these absorption peaks is theoretically obtained from magneto-phonon resonance conditions within the framework of the quantum kinetic equation. The results take into account both scattering mechanisms: electron-optical phonon and electron-acoustic phonon. Under the influence of the magnetic field, according to the increasing photon energy of the SEMW, the graph showing the dependence of the multi-photon nonlinear absorption coefficient on photon energy has the form of absorption spectrum lines following magneto-phonon resonance conditions. When increasing the value of the external magnetic field and the intensity of the SEMW, the intensity of the resonance peaks increases. In addition, the HWHM W of the resonance peaks of multi-photon absorption processes increases with increasing magnetic field $\mathrm{B}$ according to the square root law $\mathrm{W} = \kappa\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}$ but is independent of temperature. The value of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process is larger than the value of the HWHM of the multi-photon absorption processes. The calculations of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process in this paper are consistent with previous experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Thus, our calculations of the HWHM of multi-photon absorption processes can serve as reliable predictions for future experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Adachi, Hiroki Kojima, Takashi Ikegami</p>
            <p>To further understand the complex behavior of swimming microorganisms, the spontaneous motion of nonliving matter provides essential insights. While substantial research has focused on quantitatively analyzing complex behavioral patterns, characterizing these dynamics aiming for inclusive comparison to the behavior of living systems remains challenging. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigated the 'life-like' behavior of an oil droplet in an aqueous surfactant solution by identifying behavioral modes of spontaneous motion patterns in response to varying physical parameters, such as volume and oil concentration. Leveraging data-driven nonparametric dynamical systems analysis, we discovered the low dimensionality and nonlinearity of the underlying dynamical system governing oil droplet motion. Notably, our simulations demonstrate that the two-dimensional Langevin equations effectively reproduce the overall behavior experimentally observed while retaining the rational correspondence with physical parameter interpretations. These findings not only elucidate the fundamental dynamics governing the spontaneous motion of oil droplet systems but also suggest potential pathways for developing more descriptive models that bridge the gap between nonliving and living behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of the effect of increasing weak electromagnetic wave by a strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh-Tuan Tran, Nguyen Dinh Nama, Nguyen Thi Thanh Nhan, Nguyen Quang Bau</p>
            <p>Analytic expressions for the absorption coefficient (AC) of a weak electromagnetic wave (EMW) in 2D Graphene under influence of strong laser radiation are calculated using the quantum kinetic equation (QKE) in the case of electron-optical phonon scattering in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The dependence of the AC on the intensity $E_{02}$ and the frequency $\Omega_2$ of a weak EMW, on the intensity $E_{01}$ and the frequency $\Omega_1$ of a strong laser radiation, on the temperature T of the system is obtained. These results are investigated from low temperature to high temperature. These results are obtained from the QKE method, which broke the limit of the Boltzmann kinetic equations (only investigated in the high-temperature domain). Besides, the numerical results show that the AC of a weak EMW in 2D Graphene can have negative values. This demonstrates the possibility of increasing weak EMW by strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene. This is different from a similar problem in bulk semiconductors and the case without strong laser radiation. In the case of the presence of an external magnetic field, the numerical calculation results also show the appearance of the peak spectral lines that obey the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. The appearance of these resonance peaks provides a model illustrating the dependence of the Half-Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) on the external magnetic field. This is an important criterion for the fabrication of graphene-related electronic components and orientation for future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical quantum typicality: A simple method for investigating transport properties applied to the Holstein model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Petar Mitrić</p>
            <p>We examine the practical applicability of the so-called dynamical quantum typicality (QT) for the calculation of the frequency dependent mobility in electron-phonon systems. The QT approach relies on the insight that even a single, randomly chosen pure state within a high-dimensional Hilbert space can effectively represent the entire statistical ensemble. This significantly simplifies the calculation of the current-current correlation function, which in turn, within the linear response theory, is directly related to the frequency dependent mobility. The time evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$ and the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\beta H}$ are handled using the Runge-Kutta scheme. As a result, we achieve a simple, transparent method that is easy to implement, with computer memory requirements and computational effort scaling linearly with the Hilbert space dimension and the time grid length. Although this approach is quite general, we restrict our numerical results to the Holstein model for which several reliable benchmarks are available. We demonstrate that the QT effectively complements other currently employed methods by overcoming some of their inherent limitations.</p>

            <h2>Shape of Polystyrene Droplets on Soft PDMS: Exploring the Gap Between Theory and Experiment at the Three-Phase Contact Line</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khalil Remini, Leonie Schmeller, Dirk Peschka, Barbara Wagner, Ralf Seemann</p>
            <p>The shapes of liquid polystyrene (PS) droplets on viscoelastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates are investigated experimentally using atomic force microscopy for a range of droplet sizes and substrate elasticities. These shapes, which comprise the PS-air, PS-PDMS, and PDMS-air interfaces as well as the three-phase contact line, are compared to theoretical predictions using axisymmetric sharp-interface models derived through energy minimization. We find that the polystyrene droplets are cloaked by a thin layer of uncrosslinked molecules migrating from the PDMS substrate. By incorporating the effects of cloaking into the surface energies in our theoretical model, we show that the global features of the experimental droplet shapes are in excellent quantitative agreement for all droplet sizes and substrate elasticities. However, our comparisons also reveal systematic discrepancies between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions in the vicinity of the three-phase contact line. Moreover, the relative importance of these discrepancies systematically increases for softer substrates and smaller droplets. We demonstrate that global variations in system parameters, such as surface tension and elastic shear moduli, cannot explain these differences but instead point to a locally larger elastocapillary length, whose possible origin is discussed thoroughly.</p>

            <h2>A crack-length control technique for phase field fracture in FFT homogenization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Aranda, Javier Segurado</p>
            <p>Modeling the propagation of cracks at the microscopic level is fundamental to understand the effect of the microstructure on the fracture process. Nevertheless, microscopic propagation is often unstable and when using phase field fracture poor convergence is found or, in the case of using staggered algorithms, leads to the presence of jumps in the evolution of the cracks. In this work, a novel method is proposed to perform micromechanical simulations with phase field fracture imposing monotonic increases of crack length and allowing the use of monolithic implementations, being able to resolve all the snap-backs during the unstable propagation phases. The method is derived for FFT based solvers in order to exploit its very high numerical performance n micromechanical problems, but an equivalent method is also developed for Finite Elements (FE) showing the equivalence of both implementations. It is shown that the stress-strain curves and the crack paths obtained using the crack control method are superposed in stable propagation regimes to those obtained using strain control with a staggered scheme. J-integral calculations confirm that during the propagation process in the crack control method, the energy release rate remains constant and equal to an effective fracture energy that has been determined as function of the discretization for FFT simulations. Finally, to show the potential of the method, the technique is applied to simulate crack propagation through the microstructure of composites and porous materials providing an estimation of the effective fracture toughness.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor, the pressurized $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$, we present a renormalized mean-field theory of a bilayer single-band $t$-$J$ model, highlighting the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p>

An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</p>

            <p>Extensive studies on the impact of bismuth incorporation into the (Ga,Mn)As prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) on its structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties are summarized in this review. Thin epitaxial layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6% Mn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under either a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions. The high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have evidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces with the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small decrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in the coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small atomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer, predominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band, considerably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations of magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars prepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as a result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of magnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit torque effect. The latter effect is of special interest for applications to the next generation non-volatile data storage and logic spintronic devices, utilizing electrically controlled magnetization reversal.</p>

            <p>Aligning with the everlasting search for quantum spin liquids (QSLs), identifying the QSL in Kitaev magnets has garnered great research interest during the past decade and remains nevertheless an enormous challenge. One of the major difficulties lies in that Kitaev QSL is typically fragile against competing interactions like off-diagonal exchanges, which are ubiquitous in real materials due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effect. This, in turn, gives rise to many intriguing field-induced novel phases and thermal Hall effect. In this review, we will focus on the interplay of Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ exchanges from a numerical perspective. This review discusses some representative exotic phases such as $\Gamma$ spin liquid, nematic ferromagnet, spin-flop phase, and distinct chiral-spin states with spontaneously time-reversal symmetry breaking. It also presents quantum phase diagrams of anisotropic Kitaev-$\Gamma$ chains that exhibit kaleidoscopes of both ordered and disordered phases.</p>

Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</p>

            <p>A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point.

            <h2>Quantum Phase Diagram of the Bilayer Kitaev-Heisenberg Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elahe Samimi, Antonia Duft, Patrick Adelhardt, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Saeed S. Jahromi</p>
            <p>We study the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice with large-scale tensor network calculations based on the infinite projected entangled pair state technique as well as high-order series expansions. We find that beyond various magnetically ordered phases, including ferromagnetic, zigzag, antiferromagnetic (AFM) and stripy states, two extended quantum spin liquid phases arise in the proximity of the Kitaev limit. While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.</p>

            <h2>First-Principles' Derived Force Field for hBN Nanostrucrtures; Applications to Monolayers, Nanotubes and Nanotori</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aristotelis P. Sgouros, Markos Arapchatzis, Nektarios N. Lathiotakis, Konstantinos Papagelis, George Kalosakas</p>
            <p>In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. An analytical expression has been provided for the dependence of the bending rigidity of relatively large diameter hBN nanotubes on their radius.</p>

            <h2>AFM Cantilever Magnetometry for Measuring Femto-Nm Torques Generated by Single Magnetic Particles for Cell Actuation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria V. Efremova, Lotte Boer, Laurenz Edelmann, Lieke Ruijs, Jianing Li, Marc A. Verschuuren, Reinoud Lavrijsen</p>
            <p>Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6$\pm$0.6$\cdot$10$^{-15}$ Nm torque while applying 373$\pm$5 mT field at 12$\pm$2 degrees to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 $\mu$m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a $\approx$ 1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles' mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high PMA.</p>

            <p>We measured the microwave response of a HgTe quantum well Josephson junction embedded into an RF SQUID loop which is inductively coupled to a superconducting resonator. The side-contacted devices studied here operate in bulk transport mode, with a separation between the superconducting contacts smaller than both the estimated carrier mean free path and superconducting coherence length. We extract the current-phase relation and the phase-dependent microwave dissipation, that, at low temperature, primarily is related to photon-induced transitions between the Andreev bound states. We study the effects of gate voltage and temperature on our devices and compare the measurements with a tight-binding model based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. A combined analysis of both microwave admittance components allows us to confirm the presence of a small gap in the Andreev bound state spectrum at phase $\pi$, indicating high interface transparency, matching our observations in DC measurements of a similar device. Our work demonstrates the versatility of microwave measurements as a tool for Josephson junction characterization and highlights the importance of the interface properties for side-contacted Josephson devices.</p>

            <h2>Buried Interfaces and Spin Orientation in [Co/Pt]10 /Fe multilayer with Orthogonal Magnetic Anisotropy: Effect of Fe Thickness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadhana Singh, Manisha Priyadarsini, Sharanjeet Singh, Ilya Sergeev, Marcus Herlitschke, H. C. Wille, Dileep Kumar</p>
            <p>In the present work, spin orientation and variation of the strength of coupling in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer have been investigated as a function of the thickness of the Fe layer. [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer has orthogonal anisotropy with the Fe layer, and [Co/Pt]ML has in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular anisotropy, respectively. Measurements are performed using in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and isotope-sensitive depth-resolved nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) technique. Real-time in-situ MOKE measurement during Fe growth reveals that with an increase in thickness of the Fe layer, moments of Fe layer reorientation from out of the plane to in-plane direction. This is attributed to the decrease in the coupling between the [Co/Pt]ML and Fe layer. For the depth-dependent study, two [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayers having the same thickness but different positions of the Fe57 marker layer ([Co/Pt]MLFe/Fe57) and [Co/Pt]MLFe57/Fe ) were studied using the NRS technique. Films with varying external magnetic fields were also studied to investigate coupling strength. Measurements were performed under the x-ray standing wave conditions to enhance resonance yield. It is observed that for the 75 Å Fe in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer, the coupling varies along the depth of the Fe layer. The coupling is strong at [Co/Pt]ML and Fe interface with spins of the Fe layer aligned in the out-of-plane direction, whereas moments away from the interface are weakly coupled and aligned in-plane along the magnetic easy axis. Due to this gradient in strength of coupling along the depth, a large magnetic field is required to reorient spins at the interface along the magnetic hard axis of the Fe layer; however, spins away from the interface can rotate freely even in the low magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Pressure Evolution of Magnetic Structure and Quasiparticle Excitations in Anisotropic Frustrated Zigzag Chains</h2>

            <p>Frustrated magnetic systems with anisotropic exchange interactions have been recognized as key platforms for discovering exotic quantum states and quasiparticles. In this study, we report the pressure evolution of magnetic structures and quasiparticle excitations in the frustrated semiconductor YbCuS2, characterized by Yb3+ zigzag chains with competing exchange interactions. At ambient pressure, YbCuS2 exhibits a magnetic transition at TN ~ 0.95 K, forming an incommensurate helical magnetic order. Under hydrostatic pressure of 1.6 GPa, TN increases to 1.17 K, and the magnetic structure changes to a commensurate one, which can be regarded as an odd-parity magnetic multipole order. Remarkably, pressure suppresses the gapless quasiparticle excitations. These findings suggest that pressure alters the exchange interactions between the Yb ions, affecting both the magnetic ground state and the quasiparticle excitations. Our results highlight the pivotal role of anisotropic interactions in one-dimensionality to stabilize the complex quantum phases, offering insights into the interplay among frustration, dimensionality, multipoles and emergent quasiparticles.</p>

            <p>Providing radio frequency (RF) signals to circuits working in cryogenic conditions requires bulky and expensive transmission cabling interfacing specialized RF electronics anchored at room temperature. Superconducting Josephson junction arrays (JJAs) can change this paradigm by placing the RF source and detector inside the chip. In this work, we demonstrate that DC-biased JJAs can emit signals in the C-band frequency spectrum and beyond. We fabricate reproducible JJAs comprised of amorphous MoGe or NbTiN superconducting islands and metallic Au weak links. Temperature, magnetic fields, applied currents, and device design are explored to control the operation of the RF sources, while we also identify important features that affect the ideal source behavior. Combined with the proven ability of these JJAs to detect microwave radiation, these sources allow us to propose a fully DC-operated cryogenic on-chip measurement platform that is a viable alternative to the high-frequency circuitry currently required for several quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Magnetoresistance effect lays the foundation for spintronics, magnetic sensors and hard drives. The pursuit of magnetic materials with colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and/or angular magnetoresistance (AMR) has attracted enduring research interest and extensive investigations over past decades. Here we report on the discovery of field-induced record-breaking CMR of ~ -10^14 % and AMR ~ 10^14% achieved simultaneously in an antiferromagnetic rare-earth dichalcogenide EuSe2. Such intriguing observations are attributed to strong magnetic anisotropy and magnetic-field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the localized Eu2+ spins, which in turn closes the bandgap by lifting the degeneracy of Se-5p bands near Fermi level. Our DFT calculations perfectly replicate the experimental findings based on the Brillouin function and carries transport model. The present work provides a potential simple antiferromagnetic material for achieving angle-sensitive spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>The quantum $p$-spin renormalization group in the large $N$ limit as a benchmark for functional renormalization group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Parham Radpay</p>
            <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the glassy phase in $p$-spin quantum models, this paper examines the dynamics of the $N$-vector $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the framework of renormalization group theory. First, we focus on perturbation theory, which is more suitable than nonperturbative techniques due to the specific temporal non-locality of the model after disorder integration. We compute the one-loop $\beta$-function and explore the structure of its fixed points. Next, we develop the nonperturbative renormalization group approach based on the standard Wetterich-Morris formalism, using two approximation schemes to address the model's non-locality. We investigate the vertex expansion in the symmetric phase and assess the reliability of the approximations for the fixed-point solutions. Finally, we extend our analysis beyond the symmetric phase by using an expansion around the vacuum of the local potential. Our numerical investigations particularly focus on the cases $p = 2$ and $p=3$.</p>

            <h2>Fluid-Derived Lattices for Unbiased Modeling of Bacterial Colony Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryan Verhoef, Rutger Hermsen, Joost de Graaf</p>
            <p>Bacterial colonies can form a wide variety of shapes and structures based on ambient and internal conditions. To help understand the mechanisms that determine the structure of and the diversity within these colonies, various numerical modeling techniques have been applied. The most commonly used ones are continuum models, agent-based models, and lattice models. Continuum models are usually computationally fast, but disregard information at the level of the individual, which can be crucial to understanding diversity in a colony. Agent-based models resolve local details to a greater level, but are computationally costly. Lattice-based approaches strike a balance between these two limiting cases. However, this is known to come at the price of introducing undesirable artifacts into the structure of the colonies. For instance, square lattices tend to produce square colonies even where an isotropic shape is expected. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations and therefore study lattice-induced orientational symmetry in a class of hybrid numerical methods that combine aspects of lattice-based and continuum descriptions. We characterize these artifacts and show that they can be circumvented through the use of a disordered lattice which derives from an unstructured fluid. The main advantage of this approach is that the lattice itself does not imbue the colony with a preferential directionality. We demonstrate that our implementation enables the study of colony growth involving millions of individuals within hours of computation time on an ordinary desktop computer, while retaining many of the desirable features of agent-based models. Furthermore, our method can be readily adapted for a wide range of applications, opening up new avenues for studying the formation of colonies with diverse shapes and complex internal interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Mudry, Ömer M. Aksoy, Claudio Chamon, Akira Furusaki</p>
            <p>The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum phase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with competing Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is known. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up to a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at the O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a tricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature where the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the first-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the competing phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by thermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.</p>

            <p>The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.</p>

Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies.

In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.</p>

            <p>Controlling the domain structure of ferroic materials is key to manipulating their functionality. Typically, quasi-static electric, magnetic, or strain fields are exploited to transform or pole ferroic domains. In contrast, metallurgy makes use of fast thermal quenches across phase transitions to create new functional states and domain structures. This approach employs the rapid temporal evolution of systems far from equilibrium to overcome the constraints imposed by comparably slow interactions. However, guiding the nonequilibrium evolution of domains towards otherwise inaccessible configurations remains largely unexplored in ferroics. Here, we harness thermal quenches to exert control over a ferroic domain pattern. Cooling at variable speed triggers transitions between two ferroic phases in a rare-earth orthoferrite, with transient domain evolution enabling the selection of the final domain pattern. Specifically, by tuning the quench rate, we can either generate the intrinsic domain structure of the low-temperature phase or transfer the original pattern of the high-temperature phase - creating a hidden metastable domain configuration inaccessible at thermal equilibrium. Real-time imaging during rapid quenching reveals two distinct time scales governing domain evolution: a fast fragmentation phase, followed by a slower relaxation towards a new pattern or back to the original one. This dynamic control of domain configurations, alongside external fields, strain engineering, and all-optical switching, offers a novel approach for actively manipulating ferroic order.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhodeep Dey, Smarajit Karmakar</p>
            <p>Active glasses refer to a class of driven non-equilibrium systems that share remarkably similar dynamical behavior as conventional glass-formers in equilibrium. Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various biological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces additional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density fluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular dynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more strongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit results in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We also propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation spectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective temperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the dynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing activity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system size dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not been found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small activities.</p>

            <p>Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</p>

            <p>The growing interest in 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials stems from their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics, magnonics and quantum information technologies. Among them, CrSBr is a semiconductor that stands out, owing to its high Curie temperature (TC ~ 146 K), air stability and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of Dy doping (12.5%, 25%, and 50%) on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CrSBr monolayer. Our results reveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy, modulates TC, and can create quasi-1D ferromagnetic chains that arise from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate the properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to the CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the single-layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, relying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of CrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced applications at the 2D limit.</p>

            <p>In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful to capture electrical conductivities with intuitive parameters of densities and mobilities of electron-like and hole-like carriers, as well as to predict their magnetic field dependence. Yet, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst ($S_{xy}$) coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with field, respectively. Such field dependences were predicted by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and the Mott relation of the two-band system, and they are realized when two conditions are simultaneously met [1]: the multiple of cyclotron frequency ($\omega_c$) and relaxation time ($\tau$) is much larger than one, $\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and the tangent of Hall angle ($\theta_H$) is much smaller than one, $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. We use the relation between two carrier densities $n_e$ (electron-like) and $n_h$ (hole-like) derived from the field dependence of the TE coefficients, to refine the two-band model fittings. The compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$, where $\Delta n = n_e-n_h$) is found two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in the unrestricted fitting and hence the larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the framework of the semiclassical theory, we deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}\times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$. Our findings offer crucial insights not only for identifying the empirical conditions for the field-induced enhancement of the TE performance but also for engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</p>

            <h2>Third-Order Exceptional Point in Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled cold atoms</h2>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</p>

The theory incorporates the scattering geometry and polarization dependence of the Raman process and the small but finite wave vectors of the phonons for correctly describing the scattering with longitudinal optical (LO) modes in optically anisotropic solids. We implement the theory for first-order Raman scattering and showcase the approach for wurtzite Gallium Nitride and the complex chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3 in comparison to experiment. We subsequently discuss several common estimates for second-order Raman scattering in complex materials, and highlight similarities and differences to established theoretical approaches and simulation protocols both from phonon theory and molecular dynamics.</p>

            <p>Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.</p>

In particular, we argue that the main common feature of such phenomenologies is to have emerged from the induction, by nanoengineering, of novel characteristic lengths for each order, or of custom regular spatial patterns affecting them. We claim, thus, that a fruitful path to discover new phenomenology is opened by these and future searches of novel nanostructurations of superconducting materials.</p>

            <p>The hardness of materials plays an important role in material design. There are numerous experimental methods to measure the hardness of materials, but theoretical prediction of hardness is challenging. By investigating the correlation between hardness and the elastic properties of materials, namely shear and bulk moduli, the pressure derivative of bulk modulus, we have constructed a simple and physically intuitive hardness model. By introducing the spatial variation of the shear modulus, it is possible to predict the hardness anisotropy of materials to define the minimum and maximum values of hardness possessed by a particular material. Furthermore, by using the equation of states to define the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, it is possible to determine the temperature dependencies of hardness for given materials. All quantities in the model can be obtained directly from accurate first-principles calculations or from experiments, making it suitable for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>A unified and consistent electrical double layer model for treatment of core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeeshan Ahmad</p>
            <p>The electrical double layer (EDL) is fundamental to the operation of devices for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Existing models of EDL in solid electrolytes focus predominantly on the space charge layer and lack a complete treatment of the core layer which is an integral part of the EDL. The core layer exhibits significant variations in defect properties, such as defect formation energy (DFE), which influence the ionic charge carrier distribution in the space charge layer. In this work, we develop a general framework for treating both the core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes under dilute and concentrated regimes. We incorporate functional forms of the DFE variation in the core layer and defect-defect interactions that are consistent with previous first-principles simulations of solid electrolytes at surfaces and interfaces. Our simulations reveal that the core layer significantly impacts the potential distribution and defect concentrations in the solid electrolyte. In addition, the core contributes substantially to the conductivity when the surface DFE is much lower than the bulk DFE. Our model paves the way for accurate calculations of properties such as capacitance and ionic conductivity of solid-solid interfaces required for enhancing and optimizing the performance of solid-state electrochemical devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.M. Botana, M.V.Ramallo</p>
            <p>We study the critical fluctuations near the resistive transition of very thin films of high-temperature cuprate superconductors composed of a number $N$ of only a few unit cells of superconducting bilayers. For that, we solve the fluctuation spectrum of a Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau model for few-bilayers superconductors considering two alternating Josephson interlayer interaction strengths, and we obtain the corresponding paraconductivity above the transition. Then, we extend these calculations to temperatures below the transition through expressions for the Ginzburg number and Kosterlitz--Thouless-like critical region. When compared with previously available data in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ few-bilayers systems, with $N=1$ to $4$, our results seem to provide a plausible scenario for their critical regime.</p>

            <p>In this study, we explore the topological properties of the photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, focusing on both aligned and cyclic stacking configurations under the influence of off-resonant circularly polarized light. We derive precise analytical expressions for the quasi-energy bands in the aligned stacking case, while numerical results for cyclic stacking are obtained at the Dirac points. Our findings reveal that the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by circularly polarized light completely lifts the degeneracy at the $t^{a,c}$-point intersections at these Dirac points. To investigate the topological signatures of the driven $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, we examine the Berry phase through anomalous magnetic and thermal responses. Notably, at $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, we find that the orbital magnetic moments associated with both corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, along with their Berry curvatures. For values of $0 < \alpha < 1$, off-resonant light induces deformations in the bands near the Dirac points, leading to two equally sized gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum. The position of the chemical potential within these gaps significantly influences the orbital magnetization. We observe that linear variations in magnetization correlate with Chern numbers on either side of $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$. These topological features manifest as distinct quantized values of anomalous Hall conductivity across both stacking types...</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuntal Talit, David A. Strubbe</p>
            <p>The mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials are important for device flexibility, resistance to fracture, epitaxial growth, surface energetics of quantum dots, and induction or relief of stress in thin films due to thermal expansion and phase changes. These issues are particularly salient for solar cells in space applications. Nonetheless, few studies are available on the mechanical properties of the paradigmatic hybrid perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPI). Experimental results are only available for the room-temperature tetragonal phase, and there are significant discrepancies among them. Results from density functional theory (DFT) are available for all three phases but have even larger discrepancies from each other and from experiments. To clarify the disorder in the literature, we have studied the elastic properties of all three phases in detail with DFT calculations. We have examined the effect of different aspects in calculation methodology such as use of energy or stress, the structure, exchange-correlation functionals, Van der Waals corrections, pseudopotentials, $k$-point sampling, and formulas for anisotropic elasticity and polycrystalline averages. Our results provide accurate reference values and an appropriate general methodology for elastic properties of metal halide perovskites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</p>

            <p>In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p>Understanding the geometric properties of quantum states and their implications in fundamental physical phenomena is at the core of modern physics. The Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) is a central physical object in this regard, encoding complete information about the geometry of the quantum state. The imaginary part of the QGT is the well-known Berry curvature, which plays a fundamental role in the topological magnetoelectric and optoelectronic phenomena. The real part of the QGT is the quantum metric, whose importance has come to prominence very recently, giving rise to a new set of quantum geometric phenomena, such as anomalous Landau levels, flat band superfluidity, excitonic Lamb shifts, and nonlinear Hall effect. Despite the central importance of the QGT, its experimental measurements have been restricted only to artificial two-level systems. In this work, we develop a framework to measure the QGT (both quantum metric and Berry curvature) in crystalline solids using polarization-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Using this framework, we demonstrate the effective reconstruction of the QGT in solids in the archetype kagome metal CoSn, which hosts topological flat bands. The key idea is to introduce another geometrical tensor, the quasi-QGT, whose components, the band Drude weight and orbital angular momentum, are experimentally accessible and can be used for extracting the QGT. Establishing such a momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopic probe of the QGT is poised to significantly advance our understanding of quantum geometric responses in a wide range of crystalline systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (3D-CVAE) for automated anomaly detection in Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Spectrum Imaging (EELS-SI) data. Our approach leverages the full three-dimensional structure of EELS-SI data to detect subtle spectral anomalies while preserving both spatial and spectral correlations across the datacube. By employing negative log-likelihood loss and training on bulk spectra, the model learns to reconstruct bulk features characteristic of the defect-free material. In exploring methods for anomaly detection, we evaluated both our 3D-CVAE approach and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), testing their performance using Fe L-edge peak shifts designed to simulate material defects. Our results show that 3D-CVAE achieves superior anomaly detection and maintains consistent performance across various shift magnitudes. The method demonstrates clear bimodal separation between normal and anomalous spectra, enabling reliable classification. Further analysis verifies that lower dimensional representations are robust to anomalies in the data. While performance advantages over PCA diminish with decreasing anomaly concentration, our method maintains high reconstruction quality even in challenging, noise-dominated spectral regions. This approach provides a robust framework for unsupervised automated detection of spectral anomalies in EELS-SI data, particularly valuable for analyzing complex material systems.</p>

            <p>Behavioral experiments on the ultimatum game (UG) reveal that we humans prefer fair acts, which contradicts the prediction made in orthodox Economics. Existing explanations, however, are mostly attributed to exogenous factors within the imitation learning framework. Here, we adopt the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their moves aiming to maximize their accumulated rewards. Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player is assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and responder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both experiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability of successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with observations in behavioral experiments. Our mechanism analysis reveals that the system undergoes two phases, eventually stabilizing into fair or rational strategies. These results are robust when the rotating role assignment is replaced by a random or fixed manner, or the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our findings thus conclude that the endogenous factor is sufficient to explain the emergence of fairness, exogenous factors are not needed.</p>

            <p>Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of kinetically constrained lattice fermion models showing weak ergodicity breaking. The supersymmetric algebra naturally induces non-ergodic dynamics, as we illustrate here by introducing a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model. Supersymmetry directly implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic toy model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering quantum many-body scar-like eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model.</p>

            <p>The Epstein zeta function generalizes the Riemann zeta function to oscillatory lattice sums in higher dimensions. Beyond its numerous applications in pure mathematics, it has recently been identified as a key component in simulating exotic quantum materials. This work establishes the Epstein zeta function as a powerful tool in numerical analysis by rigorously investigating its analytical properties and enabling its efficient computation. Specifically, we derive a compact and computationally efficient representation of the Epstein zeta function and thoroughly examine its analytical properties across all arguments. Furthermore, we introduce a superexponentially convergent algorithm, complete with error bounds, for computing the Epstein zeta function in arbitrary dimensions. We also show that the Epstein zeta function can be decomposed into a power law singularity and an analytic function in the first Brillouin zone. This decomposition facilitates the rapid evaluation of integrals involving the Epstein zeta function and allows for efficient precomputations through interpolation techniques. We present the first high-performance implementation of the Epstein zeta function and its regularisation for arbitrary real arguments in EpsteinLib, a C library with Python and Mathematica bindings, and rigorously benchmark its precision and performance against known formulas, achieving full precision across the entire parameter range. Finally, we apply our library to the computation of quantum dispersion relations of three-dimensional spin materials with long-range interactions and Casimir energies in multidimensional geometries, uncovering higher-order corrections to known asymptotic formulas for the arising forces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang He, Vassiliy Lubchenko</p>
            <p>We construct a thermodynamic potential that can guide training of a generative model defined on a set of binary degrees of freedom. We argue that upon reduction in description, so as to make the generative model computationally-manageable, the potential develops multiple minima. This is mirrored by the emergence of multiple minima in the free energy proper of the generative model itself. The variety of training samples that employ N binary degrees of freedom is ordinarily much lower than the size 2^N of the full phase space. The non-represented configurations, we argue, should be thought of as comprising a high-temperature phase separated by an extensive energy gap from the configurations composing the training set. Thus, training amounts to sampling a free energy surface in the form of a library of distinct bound states, each of which breaks ergodicity. The ergodicity breaking prevents escape into the near continuum of states comprising the high-temperature phase; thus it is necessary for proper functionality. It may however have the side effect of limiting access to patterns that were underrepresented in the training set. At the same time, the ergodicity breaking within the library complicates both learning and retrieval. As a remedy, one may concurrently employ multiple generative models -- up to one model per free energy minimum.</p>

            <h2>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Benedetti, Horacio Casini, Javier M. Magan</p>
            <p>Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c<1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</p>

            <p>The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this Letter, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically solve our model for degree correlation and validate the theoretical predictions against empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Colmenarez, Seyong Kim, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. We observe that the erasure errors enter as a classical average over fully depolarizing channels. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a $50\%$ threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds under realistic noise and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</p>

            <h2>Interface-sensitive microwave loss in superconducting tantalum films sputtered on c-plane sapphire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony P. McFadden, Jinsu Oh, Lin Zhou, Trevyn F.Q. Larson, Stephen Gill, Akash V. Dixit, Raymond Simmonds, Florent Lecocq</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. We determine that the source of loss is located at the Ta/sapphire interface and show that it can be fully mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating the sapphire surface with \textit{in-situ} argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details that should allow for the reproducible growth of low-loss Ta film across fabrication facilities.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (`automatic potential-landscape explorer'). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium-oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning -- with a long-term vision of making it a genuine mainstream tool in physics, chemistry, and materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samir Das, Shishira Mahunta, Nikhil Gupt, Victor Mukherjee, Arnab Ghosh</p>
            <p>We use Full Counting Statistics to study fluctuations and optimal control in a three-terminal Floquet quantum thermal transistor. We model the setup using three qubits (termed as the emitter, collector and base) coupled to three thermal baths. As shown in Phys. Rev. E 106, 024110 (2022), one can achieve significant change in the emitter and collector currents through a small change in the base current, thereby achieving a thermal transistor operation. Using sinusoidal and pi-flip modulations of the base qubit frequency, we show that the variance of the base current is much less compared to those of the emitter and collector currents, while the opposite is true in case of the Fano factor. We then apply optimal control through the Chopped Random Basis optimization protocol, in order to significantly enhance the amplification obtained in the transistor. In contrast, a reduction in the Fano factor of the setup through optimal control is associated with a large base current, thereby suggesting a trade-off between precision and base current. We expect our results will be relevant for developing heat modulation devices in near-term quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manu Canals, Natalia Chepiga, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaehyeok Jin, Gregory A. Voth</p>
            <p>Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</p>

            <p>Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to ionic surfaces with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve long-standing debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering valuable benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is completely open-source, making it possible to now routinely apply cWFT to complex problems in ionic surface chemistry.</p>

            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Cogoni, Giovanni Busonera, Enrico Gobbetti</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of the fastest paths in transportation networks under increasing congestion, modeled as a linear decrease in edge travel speed with density due to interactions among selfish agents. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the fastest directed routes connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows, characterizing their shape through effective length, maximum detour, and area under the curve, and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the performance metric's distribution across uniformly distributed paths. The study covers both random planar networks with controlled characteristics and real urban networks of major cities. The low-density network regime, in which an initial smooth performance degradation is observed up to a critical traffic volume, is followed by the emergence of complex patterns of spatially heterogeneous slowdowns as traffic increases, rapidly leading to disjoint subnetworks. The failure of a few edges leads to a catastrophic decrease in the network performance. The fastest paths for all cities show a peak for detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level, defined as the flex of the rejected path ratio curve. Inness generally shows a slight attraction by city centers on paths for light traffic, but this reverses to strong repulsion during congestion. We exploit path performance to uncover an asymmetric behavior of different regions of the networks when acting as origins or destinations. Finally, the Gini coefficient is used to study the unequal effects of path performance degradation with traffic.</p>

            <h2>The Fractional Hall hierarchy from duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristan Jensen, Amir Raz</p>
            <p>We show that a modified version of Son's Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Seiberg et al gives a candidate unified description of the gapped and gapless fractional quantum Hall states within a single Landau level. Our main tool is the successive application of three-dimensional dualities to partially filled Landau levels of composite fermions, which imply that this theory has a complicated landscape of gapped vacua and critical points. This construction is the Lagrangian, or effective field theory, analogue of the flux attachment procedure. The critical points exist at even denominator filling and are well-described by a Fermi surface for a weakly coupled composite fermion coupled to an abelian Chern-Simons theory. The gapped states include odd-denominator filling fraction states with an abelian Chern-Simons description which we show matches the one expected for hierarchy states, as well as non-abelian states at even-denominator filling that arise from pair instabilities of the composite fermion's Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <p>The present study was conducted on dispersed YBa2Cu3O6+d (YBCO) during its hydration in gas-tight containers with K2CO3X1.5H2O crystal hydrate. The samples were exposed to an electromagnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz or microwave radiation of 2 GHz. Changes in the weight of various bodies located in the immediate vicinity of containers with YBCO material were detected: when above the containers, the bodies lose weight, while the weight of bodies located under the containers, on the contrary, increases. The maximum weight defect recorded in experiments with a 5 g YBCO sample was about 1 mg. Discovered weight changes are very similar to the result obtained by E.E. Podkletnov et al. [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992. V. 203. P. 441] - they observed a decrease in the weight of bodies placed above a rotating YBCO disk which was in a superconducting state and exposed to an alternating magnetic field. Podkletnov and other researchers put forward a hypothesis about screening of the gravitational field by the rotating YBCO-superconductor. Distinctive features of our experiments are the absence of the superconducting state in the YBCO material and its rotation. However, it is clear to us that we have observed the same phenomenon and, to our knowledge, this is probably the first time that Podkletnov effect has been confirmed in an independent study. Our interpretation of the effect differs from the initial one. According to our results, the YBCO material initiates a redistribution between bodies of a certain substance that affects their weight or mass.</p>

            <p>As a prototypical example for a heterostructure combining a weakly and a strongly interacting quantum many-body system, we study the interface between a semiconductor and a Mott insulator. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating or evanescent (quasi) particle solutions on both sides and assume that the interactions among the electrons in the semiconducting regions can be absorbed by an effective potential. While the propagation is described by a band-like dispersion in both the weakly and the strongly interacting case, the inverse decay length across the interface follows a different dependence on the band gap in the Mott insulator and the semiconductor. As one consequence, tunnelling through a Mott insulating layer behaves quite differently from a semiconducting (or band insulating) layer. For example, we find a strong suppression of tunnelling for energies in the middle between the upper and lower Hubbard band of the Mott insulator.</p>

            <p>In standard bosonic Josephson junctions (BJJs), particles tunnel between two single-well potentials linked by a finite barrier. The dynamics of standard BJJs have been extensively studied, both at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory. In the present work, we introduce the concept of a composite BJJ. In a composite BJJ, particles tunnel between two double-well potentials linked by a finite potential barrier between them. We focus on many-body facets of quantum dynamics and investigate how the complex structure of the junction influences tunneling. Employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, highly-accurate many-boson wave-functions are obtained from which properties are computed. We analyze the dynamics using the survival probability, the degree of fragmentation of the junction, and the fluctuations of observables, and discuss how many-boson tunneling behaves, and how it may be controlled, using the composite nature of the junction. A central result of this work relates to the degree of fragmentation of composite BJJs with different numbers of bosons. We provide strong evidence that a universal degree of fragmentation into multiple time-dependent modes takes place. Further applications are briefly discussed.</p>

In this paper, by the direct calculation of the Landau expansion for DW free energy, we argue that the phase transition between DW and metallic/SC phase in organic superconductors goes by first order at low enough temperature, which explains the spatial segregation of DW and SC at large length scale, consistent with experimental observations. This first-order phase transition is not directly related to SC and happens even above the SC transition temperature.</p>

            <p>We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</p>

            <p>We construct an efficient momentum space approach to the superconductivity in quasiperiodic multilayer systems. To this end, we extend the Brillouin zone (BZ) folding method to the superconducting (SC) phases by formulating the gap equation in the momentum space representation with the BZ folding. We show that the physical observables in quasiperiodic multilayers are generally given by so-called quasiperiodic functions. Consequently, there appear SC order parameters with finite momenta in the BZ folding method, which corresponds to the spatial fluctuation of the SC order in quasiperiodic multilayers. We also find a systematic way to compute the physical observables in the BZ folding method with a proper normalization condition using the continued fraction approximation. We apply the BZ folding method to a one-dimensional toy model of quasiperiodic superconductors and demonstrate its numerical efficiency compared to the conventional method based on the real space representation with a large system size. We also study a quasiperiodic bilayer system of Rice-Mele model and an s-wave superconductor to demonstrate an efficient computation of optical responses of a quasiperiodic superconductor with inversion symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Understanding spin wave (SW) damping, and how to control it to the point of being able to amplify SW-mediated signals, is one of the key requirements to bring the envisaged magnonic technologies to fruition. Even widely used magnetic insulators with low magnetization damping in their bulk, such as yttrium iron garnet, exhibit 100-fold increase in SW damping due to inevitable contact with metallic layers in magnonic circuits, as observed in very recent experiments [I. Bertelli et al., Adv. Quantum Technol. 4, 2100094 (2021)] mapping SW damping in spatially-resolved fashion. Here, we provide microscopic and rigorous understanding of wavevector-dependent SW damping using extended Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with nonlocal damping tensor, instead of conventional local scalar Gilbert damping, as derived from Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory. In this picture, the origin of nonlocal magnetization damping and thereby induced wavevector-dependent SW damping is interaction of localized magnetic moments of magnetic insulator with conduction electrons from the examined three different types of metallic overlayers -- normal, heavy, and altermagnetic. Due to spin-split energy-momentum dispersion of conduction electrons in the latter two cases, the nonlocal damping is anisotropic in spin and space, and it can be dramatically reduced by changing the relative orientation of the two layers when compared to the usage of normal metal overlayer.</p>

            <h2>Elastic interactions compete with persistent cell motility to drive durotaxis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhaya Bose, Haiqin Wang, Xinpeng Xu, Arvind Gopinath, Kinjal Dasbiswas</p>
            <p>The directed migration of cells toward stiffer substrate regions or durotaxis is relevant to tissue development and tumor progression. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model for single cell durotaxis that incorporates both elastic deformation-mediated cell-substrate interactions and the stochasticity of cell migration. Our model is motivated by a key observation in an early demonstration of durotaxis: a single, contractile cell at a sharp interface between a softer and a stiffer region of an elastic substrate reorients and migrates towards the stiffer region. We model migrating cells as self-propelling, persistently motile agents that exert contractile traction forces on their elastic substrate. The resulting substrate deformations induce elastic interactions with mechanical boundaries, captured by an elastic potential. Cell dynamics are governed by two critical parameters: the strength of the traction-induced boundary interaction (A) and the persistence of cell motility (Pe). The resulting elastic forces and torques align cells perpendicular (parallel) to the boundary and accumulate (deplete) them at clamped (free) boundaries. A clamped boundary induces an attractive potential, promoting durotaxis, while a free boundary generates a repulsive potential, preventing anti-durotaxis. By analyzing steady-state position and orientation probabilities, we show how accumulation and depletion depend on elastic potential strength and motility. We compare our findings with biological microswimmers and other active particles that accumulate at confining boundaries. The model defines metrics for boundary accumulation and durotaxis, presenting a phase diagram with three regimes: durotaxis, adurotaxis, and motility-induced accumulation. Our model predicts how durotaxis depends on cell contractility and motility, offering insights and testable predictions for future experiments.</p>

            <h2>A minimal model of inelastic tunneling of vibrating magnetic molecules on superconducting substrates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Athanasios Koliogiorgos, Richard Korytár</p>
            <p>We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.</p>

            <p>An emerging concept for identification of different types of spin liquids is through the use of spontaneous spin noise. Here we develop spin noise spectroscopy for spin liquid studies by considering Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, a material hypothesized to be either a quantum or a spiral spin liquid. By enhancing techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies we measure the time and temperature dependence of spontaneous flux $\varPhi(t, T)$ and thus magnetization $M(t, T)$ of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ samples. The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise $S_M(\omega,T)$ reveals intense spin fluctuations with $S_M(\omega,T) \propto \omega^{-\alpha(T)}$ and 0.84 < $\alpha (T)$ < 1.04 . Both the variance $\sigma_M^2(T)$ and the correlation function $C_M(t,T)$ of this spin noise undergo crossovers at a temperature $T^* \approx$ 450 mK. While predictions for quantum spin liquids are inconsistent with this phenomenology, those from Monte-Carlo simulations of a 2D spiral spin liquid state in Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ yield overall quantitative correspondence with the measured frequency and temperature dependences of $S_M(\omega,T), C_M(t,T)$ and $\sigma _M^2(T)$, thus indicating that Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ is a spiral spin liquid.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongqian Zhu, Jia-Tao Sun, Jinbo Pan, Jun Deng, Shixuan Du</p>
            <p>The anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is a pivotal phenomenon that allows for the exploitation of the valley degree of freedom in materials. A general strategy for its realization and manipulation is crucial for valleytronics. Here, by considering all possible symmetries, we propose general rules for the realization and manipulation of AVHE in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices. The realization of AVHE requires breaking the enforced symmetry that is associated with different valleys or reverses the sign of Berry curvature. Further manipulation of AVHE requires asymmetry operators connecting two states with opposite signs of Berry curvature. These rules for realizing and manipulating AVHE are extendable to generic points in momentum space. Combined with first-principles calculations, we realize the controllable AVHE in four representative systems, i.e., monolayer AgCrP2Se6, CrOBr, FeCl2 and bilayer TcGeSe3. Our work provides symmetry rules for designing valleytronic materials that could facilitate the experimental detection and realistic applications.</p>

            <h2>Incorporating precipitation-related effects on plastic anisotropy of age-hardenable aluminium alloys into crystal plasticity constitutive models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Wessel, Emin Semih Perdahcıoğlu, Ton van den Boogaard, Alexander Butz, Wolfram Volk</p>
            <p>Crystal plasticity finite element simulations are frequently employed to predict the plastic anisotropy of polycrystalline metals based on their crystallographic texture. In age-hardenable aluminium alloys, however, the texture-induced plastic anisotropy is known to affect by precipitation. This paper presents a new modelling approach to incorporate this effect into crystal plasticity constitutive models. The approach focuses on the overall effect of precipitation, which is assumed to result in an additional directional dependency with respect to a global material orientation, superimposed with the texture-induced plastic anisotropy. This additional directional dependency is implemented into a conventional crystal plasticity constitutive model via a modified hardening law that introduces two new parameters, of which only one is treated as a free parameter. To demonstrate the applicability of the new modelling approach, it is applied to an age-hardenable AA6014-T4 aluminium alloy and compared against a state-of-the-art crystal plasticity constitutive model that considers only crystallographic texture. The results demonstrate that the new modelling approach significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the plastic anisotropy for the AA6014-T4 aluminium alloy studied.</p>

            <p>V-based XVH$_3$ (X = Li,K) hydrides perovskites are investigated for their hydrogen storage capacity using the WIEN2K code. To verify the stability of these hydrides, first-principles investigations are employed to examine their structural, electronic and hydrogen storage properties. According to structural studies these compositions hydrides are stable and part of the cubic space group (221 Pm-3m). We have examined many aspects of these compositions throughout, using the PBE-GGA exchange correlation potential. We obtained the energy versus volume curve and found the stable phase and structural parameter of these hydrides using equation of state given by Birch-Murnaghan's. These hydrides thermodynamic stability is expressed in terms of their gravimetric hydrogen storage this http URL goal of this study is to compute the standard enthalpy of formation and thermal desorption to ascertain the stability of these hydrides. Based on band structure and density of state plots it is found that these compositions are metallic in nature. The study presents a preliminary theoretical approach for hydrogen storage applications of thermoelectric compositions, revealing their strong thermoelectric responses and potential for green energy sources.</p>

            <p>Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows to control the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateo Uldemolins, Freek Massee, Tristan Cren, Andrej Mesaros, Pascal Simon</p>
            <p>The spatial structure of in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states induced by a magnetic impurity in a superconductor is the essential ingredient for the possibility of engineering collective impurity states. Recently, a saddle-point approximation [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144503] revealed how the spatial form of a YSR state is controlled by an anisotropic exponential decay length, and an anisotropic prefactor, which depends on the Fermi velocity and Fermi-surface curvature. Here we analyze scanning tunnel microscope (STM) data on YSR states in NbSe$_2$, focusing on a key issue that the exponential decay length predicted theoretically from the small superconducting gap is much larger than the observed extent of YSR states. We confirm that the exponential decay can be neglected in the analysis of the anisotropy. Instead, we extract the anisotropic prefactor directly from the data, matching it to the theoretical prediction, and we establish that the theoretical expression for the prefactor alone captures the characteristic flower-like shape of the YSR state. Surprisingly, we find that up to linear order in the superconducting gap the anisotropic prefactor that determines the shape of YSR states is the same as the anisotropic response to the impurity in the underlying normal metal. Our work points out the correct way to analyze STM data on impurities in small-gap superconductors, and reveals the importance of the normal band structure's curvature and Fermi velocity in designing multi-impurity in-gap states in superconductors.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear photomagnetization is a process by which an oscillating electric field induces a static magnetization. We show that all 32 crystallographic point groups admit such spin polarization using circularly polarized electric fields to second order (as in the usual spin orientation or inverse Faraday effect) but only 29 points groups admit spin polarization using linearly polarized electric fields to second order. The excluded point groups are the highly symmetric $m$-3$m$, -$43m$ and 432. Using density functional theory we compute the spectrum of the second-order electric spin susceptibility of prototypical semiconductors Te, Se, SnS$_2$, GaAs, InSb and Si which corresponds to nonmagnetic materials with and without inversion symmetry. We show that nonlinear photomagnetization can be comparable to those of naturally occurring ferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <p>A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</p>

            <p>In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this work, we propose to realize emergent spacetime SUSY using reconfigurable Rydberg atom arrays featuring two distinct sets of Rydberg excitations, tailored for implementation on dual-species platforms. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we leverage the hybrid analog-digital nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which allows for the simulation of a physical Hamiltonian and the execution of a digital quantum circuit on the same platform. This hybrid protocol offers a new perspective for uncovering the hidden structure of emergent spacetime SUSY.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jevgenijs Kaupuzs, Roderick Melnik</p>
            <p>Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been performed to refine the estimation of the correction-to-scaling exponent $\omega$ in the 2D $\varphi^4$ model, which belongs to one of the most fundamental universality classes. If corrections have the form $\propto L^{-\omega}$, then we find $\omega=1.546(30)$ and $\omega=1.509(14)$ as the best estimates. These are obtained from the finite-size scaling of the susceptibility data in the range of linear lattice sizes $L \in [128,2048]$ at the critical value of the Binder cumulant and from the scaling of the corresponding pseudocritical couplings within $L \in [64,2048]$. These values agree with several other MC estimates at the assumption of the power-law corrections and are comparable with the known results of the $\epsilon$-expansion. In addition, we have tested the consistency with the scaling corrections of the form $\propto L^{-4/3}$, $\propto L^{-4/3} \ln L$ and $\propto L^{-4/3} /\ln L$, which might be expected from some considerations of the renormalization group and Coulomb gas model. The latter option is consistent with our MC data. Our MC results served as a basis for a critical reconsideration of some earlier theoretical conjectures and scaling assumptions. In particular, we have corrected and refined our previous analysis by grouping Feynman diagrams. The renewed analysis gives $\omega \approx 4-d-2 \eta$ as some approximation for spatial dimensions $d<4$, or $\omega \approx 1.5$ in two dimensions.</p>

Through extensive many-body exact diagonalization, we provide compelling evidence for various fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs, including the Laughlin states, Halperin states, and FCIs with tunable topological orders in Chern number |C| = 2 bands. We also discuss the relationship among band geometry, band filling and spin polarization. Notably, by examining both the entanglement spectrum and many-body Chern number, we reveal a state with Laughlin-like topological order emerging in the |C| = 2 band, which challenges the existing theoretical understanding of high Chern number (high-C) FCIs. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators and underscore the need for further investigation into high-C FCIs.</p>

For their 1D counterparts, the Janus nanotubes possess curvature, which introduce an additional degree of freedom to break the structural symmetry.

In addition, Janus MSSe nanotubes (M=W, Mo), with diameters surpassing 40 Å and Se positioned externally, consistently demonstrate lower energy states than their Janus monolayer counterparts. However, there have been limited studies on the preparation of Janus nanotubes, due to the synthesis challenge and limited sample quality. Here we first synthesized MoS2 nanotubes based on SWCNT-BNNT heterostructure and then explored the growth of Janus MoSSe nanotubes from MoS2 nanotubes with the assistance of H2 plasma at room temperature. The successful formation of the Janus structure was confirmed via Raman spectroscopy, and microscopic morphology and elemental distribution of the grown samples were further characterized.

When the interaction between them is short-ranged, the long-time behavior of the driven particle is remarkably universal -- the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and the typical position of the driven particle exhibits the same qualitative behaviors independent of the specific form of the potential. In particular, the MSD grows as $t^{1/2}$ in one dimension and $\log t$ in two spatial dimensions. We compute the exact scaling functions for the position distribution in $d=1$ and $d=2$. These functions are universal when the interaction is short-ranged. For long-ranged interactions, the MSD of the driven particle grows as $t^{\phi}$ with exponent $\phi$ depending on the tail of the potential.</p>

This geometry supports a two-band insulating electronic system with Chern topology induced by a complex hopping parameter. Inspired by the recent advances in the topology of non-Hermitian systems, in this work we study a non-Hermitian version of the topological checkerboard lattice. The complex band structure and Berry curvature are calculated. In the insulating phase, the Chern number is the same as in the Hermitian version, but the Hall conductivity is no longer quantized. The dependence of the Hall conductivity with the non-Hermitian parameters is investigated. The non-Hermiticity can be seen as a result of dissipation caused by coupling the system to the environment, so this study casts light on the topology of open systems in condensed matter physics.</p>

Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</p>

            <p>The study of the gauge field is an everlasting topic in modern physics. Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical Raman lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we propose a straightforward way to engineer one-dimensional density-dependent gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard model in spin-orbit coupled Raman lattices. Next, we study the model from two perspectives: few-body quantum walk dynamics and many-body ground state. In the first perspective, we show that large spin-flipped tunneling can lead to a deep two-body bound state. In the second perspective, mean-field and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations consistently reveal three different phases, i.e. the Mott insulator phase, the superfluid phase, and the magnetic superfluid phase.

            <p>We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave may appear in these Chern bands with $1/3$ filling. Furthermore, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of materials such as ReAg$_2$Br$_6$, ReAu$_2$I$_6$ and ReCu$_2X_6$ ($X$=Cl, Br, I). These notable predictions in pristine 2D materials, if realized experimentally, could offer a new playground for exploring correlated topological states at elevated temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanfeng Zhai</p>
            <p>Numerical modeling of polycrystal plasticity is computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals.

            <h2>Unconventional superconductivity in altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanuildo S. de Carvalho, Hermann Freire</p>
            <p>We investigate some possible symmetries of the superconducting state that emerges in three-dimensional altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate within a weak-coupling approach that these altermagnets, which naturally possess an order modulated by a vector form factor $\boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, favor spin-triplet superconductivity described by gap functions given by $\boldsymbol{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) \times \boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) = - \boldsymbol{u}(-\mathbf{k})$. Consequently, this singles out $f$-wave spin-triplet superconductivity as the most favorable pairing state to appear in the vicinity of $d$-wave altermagnetism. Furthermore, we obtain that the combination of spin-singlet superconducting states with altermagnetism gives rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that, for a class of spin-orbit coupled altermagnetic models, a superconducting phase is expected to appear at low temperatures as an intertwined $d + if$ state, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.</p>

            <h2>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Iskin</p>
            <p>We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the analogous tensor to estimate the average size of Cooper pairs within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime of dispersive bands, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</p>

            <h2>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tina N. Mihm, K. Jing Trerayapiwat, Xinxin Li, Xuedan Ma, Sahar Sharifzadeh</p>
            <p>Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</p>

The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied.

            <h2>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajsekhar Das, T. R. Kirkpatrick, D. Thirumalai</p>
            <p>The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($> \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$, which not only depends on the pinning method but is different from $\phi_d$ of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</p>

            <p>The synergy between real and reciprocal space topology is anticipated to yield a diverse array of topological properties in quantum materials. We address this pursuit by achieving topologically safeguarded magnetic order in novel Weyl metallic Heusler alloy, Mn$_{2}$Pd$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The system possesses non-centrosymmetric D$_{2d}$ crystal symmetry with notable spin-orbit coupling effects. Our first principles calculations confirm the topological non-trivial nature of band structure, including 42 pairs of Weyl nodes at/near the Fermi level, offering deeper insights into the observed anomalous Hall effect mediated by intrinsic Berry curvature. A unique canted magnetic ordering facilitates such rich topological features, manifesting through an exceptionally large topological Hall effect at low fields. The latter is sustained even at room temperature and compared with other known topological magnetic materials. Detailed micromagnetic simulations demonstrate the possible existence of an antiskyrmion lattice. Our results underscore the $D_{2d}$ Heusler magnets as a possible platform to explore the intricate interplay of non-trivial topology across real and reciprocal spaces to leverage a plethora of emergent properties for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Jiangbin Gong, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Topologically protected edge states exactly at topological phase boundaries challenge the conventional belief that topological states must be associated with a bulk energy gap. Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality. Working on a class of chiral-symmetric, Floquet-driven Majorana fermion chains, we analytically and computationally show that the precise boundaries between different Floquet topological gapped phases can accommodate topological edge modes, including the so-called Majorana $\pi$ modes. We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our results break new grounds for studies of nonequilibrium topological phases of matter undergoing topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Nambiar, Andrey Grankin, Mohammad Hafezi</p>
            <p>In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</p>

            <p>Thermal transport in nanostructures plays a critical role in modern technologies. As devices shrink, techniques that can measure thermal properties at nanometer and nanosecond scales are increasingly needed to capture transient, out-of-equilibrium phenomena. We present a novel pump-probe photon-electron method within a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map temperature dynamics with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. By combining focused laser-induced heating and synchronized time-resolved monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we track phonon, exciton and plasmon signals in various materials, including silicon nitride, aluminum thin film, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results demonstrate the technique's ability to follow temperature changes at the nanometer and nanosecond scales. The experimental data closely matched theoretical heat diffusion models, confirming the method's validity. This approach opens new opportunities to investigate transient thermal phenomena in nanoscale materials, offering valuable insights for applications in thermoelectric devices and nanoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>Wave propagation in time-varying media has attracted significant attention for its innovative potential to control wave-matter interactions and to develop versatile active materials. While most research has focused on electromagnetic waves, studies on Dirac-type waves remain limited. In this work, we investigate temporal scattering in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems with random temporal mass variations. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact expressions for temporal reflectance in both short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time limit, reflectance probabilities become uniformly distributed, and wave group velocities decay to zero, indicating spatial localization. Numerical simulations reveal that narrow wave pulses evolve into Gaussian shapes, with their centers localizing and their widths growing indefinitely due to diffusive behavior. This universal phenomenon is independent of the initial pulse profile and the statistical properties of the random mass. Our findings demonstrate that random temporal variations can induce insulating behavior in Dirac materials, offering potential applications in solid-state physics and optics.</p>

We show finite scale singularities due to the disorder, interpreted as the signal in the perturbation theory. The unconventional renormalization group approach is based on coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic term, with an eigenvalue distribution following a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit.

Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naïve method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.</p>

Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</p>

Introducing a microscopic Floquet framework, we find a novel two-quasiparticle non-equilibrium tunneling process absent in existing lowest-order tunneling approximations. We attribute the origin of the subharmonics to this non-equilibrium tunneling of the Josephson effect. We elaborate this via two complementary perspectives: in the time domain, as the interference of non-equilibrium current pulses, and in the frequency domain, as a generalized form of multiple Andreev reflections. Our framework extends to various types of Josephson junctions, providing insights into Josephson dynamics critical to quantum technologies.</p>

The tracer diffusion measurements along the crystallographic directions perpendicular to (001) and (010) in alularia feldspar reveled a slight (within a factor of two to three) anisotropy of Na diffusion with the faster diffusion rates along the perpendicular to (001) directions, while this difference was less prominent in orthoclase. The anisotropy of Na diffusion is specifically addressed for orthoclase and the full diffusion tensor is determined. The impact of temperature and composition on diffusion in natural alkali feldspars is discussed with respect to impurities and intrinsic defects.

            <p>Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence, while the understanding of its microscopic laws and classification has remained unsatisfactory. Here, universal scaling evolution reflected by coarsening in a multi-component Bose gas is traced back to a low-energy effective theory given by a double sine-Gordon (DSG) model for a single real scalar field. Our experimental observations of a rubidium spinor BEC support the applicability of this model. Evaluating the scaling evolution according to the low-energy effective model demonstrates the universal aspects of the scaling characteristics as compared with that of the spinor gas. The difference between diffusion-type and sub-diffusive scaling is shown to be connected to the occupation of minima within the DSG potential. Our results point to a path towards a microscopic description and classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of much interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-condensate magnon states. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.</p>

We identify a growth window where Mn$_3$Sn growth can be controlled through slight adjustments of the Mn flux, achieving either $\mu$m$^2$-sized high crystalline-quality islands or an almost completely continuous film. High-resolution X-ray diffraction results indicate that both films are highly (0001) oriented. The atomic resolution images show clear film-substrate interfaces displaying an epitaxial relationship. Scanning precession electron diffraction measurements reveal that the island featured sample has highly crystallized Mn$_3$Sn. The sample featuring a high continuity exhibits defects in some areas but retains the dominant Mn$_3$Sn structure. This work demonstrates a potential method for synthesizing high crystalline-quality Mn$_3$Sn films with substantial coverage, facilitating the study of Mn3Sn films without the influence of an additional buffer layer and promoting their application in integrated spintronics.</p>

            <p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently used to design and improve the hydraulic properties of biomedical devices, wherein the large scale blood circulation needs to be simulated by accounting for the mechanical response of red blood cells (RBCs) at mesoscales. In many practical instances, biomedical devices work on time-scales comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of RBCs: thus, a systematic understanding of the time-dependent response of erythrocyte membranes is crucial for the effective design of such devices. So far, this information has been deduced from experimental data, which do not necessarily adapt to the the broad variety of the fluid dynamic conditions that can be encountered in practice. This work explores the novel possibility of studying the time-dependent response of an erythrocyte membrane to external mechanical loads via ab-initio, mesoscale numerical simulations, with a primary focus on the detailed characterisation of the RBC relaxation time $t_c$ following the arrest of the external mechanical load. The adopted mesoscale model exploits a hybrid Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM), coupled with the Standard Linear Solid model (SLS) to account for the RBC membrane viscosity. We underscore the key importance of the 2D membrane viscosity $\mu_{m}$ to correctly reproduce the relaxation time of the RBC membrane. A detailed assessment of the dependencies on the typology and strength of the applied mechanical loads is also provided. Overall, our findings open interesting future perspectives for the study of the non-linear response of RBCs immersed in time-dependent strain fields.</p>

This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz. Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers. The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.</p>

            <h2>Topological phases of unitary dynamics: Classification in Clifford category</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeongwan Haah</p>
            <p>A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.</p>

            <p>In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</p>

            <h2>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Giachello, Francesco Scardino, Giacomo Gradenigo</p>
            <p>We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a $d$=1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda \phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this "microcanonical" ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a "canonical-like" one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi] \propto \exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anchit Jain, Rozhin Nobahari, Aristide Baratin, Stefano Sarao Mannelli</p>
            <p>Machine learning systems often acquire biases by leveraging undesired features in the data, impacting accuracy variably across different sub-populations. Current understanding of bias formation mostly focuses on the initial and final stages of learning, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the transient dynamics. To address this gap, this paper explores the evolution of bias in a teacher-student setup modeling different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model. We provide an analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in this setting, which we prove to be exact in high dimension. Notably, our analysis reveals how different properties of sub-populations influence bias at different timescales, showing a shifting preference of the classifier during training. Applying our findings to fairness and robustness, we delineate how and when heterogeneous data and spurious features can generate and amplify bias. We empirically validate our results in more complex scenarios by training deeper networks on synthetic and real datasets, including CIFAR10, MNIST, and CelebA.</p>

Our main contribution lies in modeling the intensity distribution along these lines by considering DS around individual reciprocal lattice nodes. The model incorporates contributions from both general DS and mosaicity, elucidating their connection to second-order scattering events. This comprehensive approach advances our understanding of DMS phenomena, enabling their use as probes for complex material behavior, particularly under extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. In principle, quantum dot (QD) lasers are more radiation-resistant than traditional semiconductor lasers because of their superior carrier confinement and smaller active regions. However, the multifaceted nature of radiation effects on QDs resulted in ongoing controversies. Comprehensive testing under simulated space conditions is also necessary to validate their performance. In this work, we conducted radiation tests on various In(Ga)As/GaAs QD and quantum well (QW) materials and devices. Our results revealed that InAs/GaAs QDs with filling factors greater than 50% exhibit greater radiation hardness than those below 50%. Furthermore, most InAs/GaAs QDs showed superior radiation resistance compared to InGaAs/GaAs QW when exposed to low proton fluences of 1E11 and 1E12 cm-2, resulting from radiation-induced defects. The linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of well-designed QD lasers remains remarkably stable and close to zero, even under proton irradiation at a maximum fluence of 7E13 cm-2, owing to their inherent insensitivity to irradiation-induced defects. These QD lasers demonstrate an exceptional average relative intensity noise (RIN) level of -162 dB/Hz, with only a 1 dB/Hz increase in RIN observed at the highest fluence, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the lasers exhibit remarkable robustness against optical feedback, sustaining stable performance even under a feedback strength as high as -3.1 dB. These results highlight the significant potential of QD lasers for space laser communication applications, where high reliability and resilience to radiation and environmental perturbations are critical.</p>

            <p>Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</p>

            <p>Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) promise to offer a computationally efficient alternative to ab initio simulations for complex molecular systems. However, ensuring their generalizability beyond training data is crucial for their wide application in studying solid materials. This work investigates the ability of a graph neural network (GNN)-based MLFF, trained on Lennard-Jones Argon, to describe solid-state phenomena not explicitly included during training. We assess the MLFF's performance in predicting phonon density of states (PDOS) for a perfect face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at both zero and finite temperatures. Additionally, we evaluate vacancy migration rates and energy barriers in an imperfect crystal using direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the string method. Notably, vacancy configurations were absent from the training data. Our results demonstrate the MLFF's capability to capture essential solid-state properties with good agreement to reference data, even for unseen configurations. We further discuss data engineering strategies to enhance the generalizability of MLFFs. The proposed set of benchmark tests and workflow for evaluating MLFF performance in describing perfect and imperfect crystals pave the way for reliable application of MLFFs in studying complex solid-state materials.</p>

            <p>We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible in standard simulations. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. For a model system and chignolin in explicit water, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting in molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We use these accelerated simulations to infer important kinetic observables such as the unbiased mean first-passage time and direct transit time. For the latter, Metadynamics with informed resetting leads to speedups of 2-3 orders of magnitude over unbiased simulations with relative errors of only ~35-70%. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</p>

            <p>The generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) equation is the equivalent of the Euler equations of hydrodynamics for integrable models. Systems of hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equations usually develop shocks and are plagued by problems of uniqueness. We establish for the first time the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the full GHD equation and the absence of shocks, from a large class of initial conditions with bounded occupation function. We assume only absolute integrability of the two-body scattering shift. In applications to quantum models of fermionic type, this includes all commonly used physical initial states, such as locally thermal states and zero-entropy states. We show in particular that differentiable initial conditions give differentiable solutions at all times and that weak initial conditions such as the Riemann problem have unique weak solutions which preserve entropy. For this purpose, we write the GHD equation as a new fixed-point problem (announced in a companion paper). We show that the fixed point exists, is unique, and is approached, under an iterative solution procedure, in the Banach topology on functions of momenta.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sharif A. Sulaiman, Zahra Shomali</p>
            <p>As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</p>

            <p>Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.</p>

By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, C. Witteveen, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, M. Bartkowiak, H. Luetkens, R. Khasanov, F.O. von Rohr, Z. Guguchia</p>
            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozières-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</p>

            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Halder, Sudip Mandal, Kalpataru Pradhan</p>
            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data.

            <h2>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</h2>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <h2>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Lorez, Mohit Pundir</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</p>

            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>

            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite.

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha</p>
            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei</p>
            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction.

            <p>Building on our recent study [this https URL, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <h2>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</h2>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Turbulent dissipative coupling in nanoscale multimode superfluid acoustics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Condensation and Synchronization in Aligning Chiral Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujia Wang, Bruno Ventéjou, Hugues Chaté, Xia-qing Shi</p>
            <p>We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Edelstein effect from the gradient of a scalar potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</p>
            <p>We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Topological Classification of One-Dimensional Chiral Symmetric Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry MullineauxSanders, Bernd Braunecker</p>
            <p>We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in a $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Cheng, Pablo de Vera, Rafael Garcia-Molina</p>
            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

The rapid response in the former process is applicable to a direct determination of temporal overlap between THz and X-ray pulses for THz pump-X-ray probe experiments with an accuracy of a few picoseconds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

            <p>ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <h2>The joint distribution of first return times and of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1D random walk before returning to the origin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mordechai Gruda, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Reimer Kühn</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <h2>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <h2>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asheesh S. Momi, Michael C. Abbott, Julian Rubinfien, Benjamin B. Machta, Isabella R. Graf</p>
            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <h2>Counterfactual rewards promote collective transport using individually controlled swarm microrobots</h2>

            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. R. Passos, Thiago R. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atsuhisa Ota</p>
            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties.

By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, C. Witteveen, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, M. Bartkowiak, H. Luetkens, R. Khasanov, F.O. von Rohr, Z. Guguchia</p>
            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shraddha Singh, Gil Refael, Aashish Clerk, Emma Rosenfeld</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Diniz</p>
            <p>Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozières-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</p>

            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <h2>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Lorez, Mohit Pundir</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shisheng Lin, Shaoqi Huang, Minhui Yang, Xin Chen, Hongjia Bi, Kangchen Xiong</p>
            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>

            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

Second by computing directly the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits.

Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite.

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

            <p>The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <h2>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha</p>
            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei</p>
            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</p>

            <p>Building on our recent study [this https URL, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <h2>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</h2>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Turbulent dissipative coupling in nanoscale multimode superfluid acoustics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropy-driven topological quantum phase transition in magnetic impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</h2>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Poincloux, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi</p>
            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

            <p>We reassess the structure of the effective action and quantum critical singularities of two-dimensional Fermi systems characterized by the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}= \vec{0}$. By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Nanobubbles wield significant influence over the electronic properties of 2D materials, showing diverse applications ranging from flexible devices to strain sensors. Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities.

            <h2>Orbital Edelstein effect from the gradient of a scalar potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</p>
            <p>We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Topological Classification of One-Dimensional Chiral Symmetric Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry MullineauxSanders, Bernd Braunecker</p>
            <p>We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</p>

            <p>We present a self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered solid. The solid is modeled as a collection of randomly distributed particles connected by harmonic springs with strengths that depend on the interparticle distances, i.e the Euclidean random matrix model of Mezard et al.

Within our approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming transition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <h2>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</h2>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in a $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Cheng, Pablo de Vera, Rafael Garcia-Molina</p>
            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

The rapid response in the former process is applicable to a direct determination of temporal overlap between THz and X-ray pulses for THz pump-X-ray probe experiments with an accuracy of a few picoseconds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

            <p>ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mordechai Gruda, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Reimer Kühn</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations.

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asheesh S. Momi, Michael C. Abbott, Julian Rubinfien, Benjamin B. Machta, Isabella R. Graf</p>
            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingqing Cheng</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. R. Passos, Thiago R. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atsuhisa Ota</p>
            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>In this work, we have implemented an accurate machine-learning approach for predicting various key analog and RF parameters of Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistors (NCFETs). Visual TCAD simulator and the Python high-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However, the computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning approach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different sources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an artificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output relationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across various temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses ($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$, the switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower compared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the switching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore, at substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\%$ from $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio increases by $41\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that $T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal settings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These findings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and integrated circuit (IC) design.</p>

Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties.

By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, C. Witteveen, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, M. Bartkowiak, H. Luetkens, R. Khasanov, F.O. von Rohr, Z. Guguchia</p>
            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Alexander N. Rudenko, Yvan Sidis, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p>Compounds based on Cr have been found to be among the first single-layer magnets. In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit.

We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>
