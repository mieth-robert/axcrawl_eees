            <h2>Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Schäfer, Paul L. Ebert, Noah Hassan, Johannes Reuther, David J. Luitz, Alexander Wietek</p>
            <p>We study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice using several numerical approaches, focusing on the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE), which exhibits an unconventional convergence extending to low and even zero temperatures. We evaluate thermodynamic properties as well as spin-spin correlations through the equal-time structure factor. Within NLCE the specific heat capacity reveals a two-peak structure at $T_1 \approx 0.479\,J$ and $T_2 \approx 0.131\,J$, reminiscent of the corresponding result for the triangular lattice. At intermediate temperatures, the spin-spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs. The NLCE results are benchmarked against Pseudo-Majorana Functional Renormalization Group, finite-temperature Lanczos, and classical Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>Perspective: Magnon-magnon coupling in hybrid magnonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Zhang, Yuzan Xiong, Jia-Mian Hu, Joseph Sklenar, Mitra Mani Subedi, M.Benjamin Jungfleisch, Vinayak S. Bhat, Yi Li, Luqiao Liu, Qiuyuan Wang, Yunqiu Kelly Luo, Youn Jue Bae, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>The internal coupling of magnetic excitations (magnons) with themselves has created a new research sub-field in hybrid magnonics, i.e., magnon-magnon coupling, which focuses on materials discovery and engineering for probing and controlling magnons in a coherent manner. This is enabled by, one, the abundant mechanisms of introducing magnetic interactions, with examples of exchange coupling, dipolar coupling, RKKY coupling, and DMI coupling, and two, the vast knowledge of how to control magnon band structure, including field and wavelength dependences of frequencies, for determining the degeneracy of magnon modes with different symmetries. In particular, we discuss how magnon-magnon coupling is implemented in various materials systems, with examples of magnetic bilayers, synthetic antiferromagnets, nanomagnetic arrays, layered van der Waals magnets, and (DMI SOT materials) in magnetic multilayers. We then introduce new concept of applications for these hybrid magnonic materials systems, with examples of frequency up/down conversion and magnon-exciton coupling, and discuss what properties are desired for achieving those applications.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration of the ODMR activity of the telecom range ClV center in SiC: a wavefunction theory analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zsolt Benedek, Oscar Bulancea-Lindvall, Joel Davidsson, Viktor Ivády, Igor Abrikosov</p>
            <p>Recently, density functional theory-based high-throughput screening of point defects in 4H-SiC revealed the positively charged chlorine-vacancy (ClV) defect to be a promising quantum bit candidate emitting at telecom wavelengths, with an electronic structure analogous to the well-known NV center in diamond. Furthermore, recent infrared photoluminescence (PL) measurements on chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC have revealed new PL lines associated with the ClV defect. While the defect possesses a high-spin ground state, there is a lack of evidence of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), a key ingredient for optical spin initialization and readout. In this Letter, we employ a multireference wavefunction-based quantum chemistry method, specifically, second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) on top of a defect-localized many-body wavefunction (CASSCF), to explore the many-body electronic structure of the ClV center. We estimate photoluminescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing rates to investigate the possibility of spin polarization and ODMR activity. Our findings establish the ClV center in 4H-SiC as an optically addressable spin qubit with fiber optics compatibility in the technologically mature 4H-SiC host material, enabling the development of large-scale quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous spin-lattice coupling in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor revealed by surface acoustic Rayleigh waves</h2>

            <p>Magnetic order in van der Waals magnets can strongly influence their lattice dynamics, yet how this interaction manifests across different phonon length scales remains unclear. Optical phonons probe bond-scale exchange modulation and short-range spin correlations, whereas long-wavelength acoustic modes couple to uniform strain fields and are sensitive to the renormalization of the macroscopic elastic tensor associated with long-range magnetic order. Experimentally accessing these low-energy acoustic excitations in low-dimensional crystals is challenging due to their low energies and the small lateral dimensions of exfoliated samples. Here, we employ angle-resolved Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering spectroscopy to investigate the surface acoustic phonon spectrum of exfoliated NiPS3 thin films across their antiferromagnetic transition temperature. Our results show a single Rayleigh surface mode whose phase velocity exhibits a pronounced 5.5% softening upon cooling through the Neel temperature. This anomaly reflects a giant magnetoelastic renormalization of the long-wavelength elastic constants triggered by the onset of zigzag antiferromagnetic order. First-principles calculations of the full elastic tensor, combined with continuum finite-element modelling of the NiPS3/SiO2/Si heterostructure, reproduce both the Rayleigh-wave dispersion and its magnetic-order-induced shift. The obtained results reveal how microscopic exchange interactions shape macroscopic mechanical properties in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, providing a basis for lattice-controlled magnetism and magnetically tunable phononic, magnonic, and strain-mediated spintronic device concepts.</p>

            <h2>Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muxian Xu, Siyu Cheng, Andrea Capa Salinas, Ganesh Pokharel, Alexander LaFleur, Hong Li, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Qinwen Deng, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Stephen D. Wilson, Ilija Zeljkovic</p>
            <p>Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</p>

            <h2>Robust Paramagnon and Acoustic Plasmon in a Photo-excited Electron-doped Cuprate Superconductor</h2>

            <p>Characterizing the spin and charge degrees of freedom in high-temperature superconducting cuprates under non-equilibrium conditions provides new insights into their electronic correlations. However, their collective dynamics have been largely unexplored due to experimental challenges. Here, we use time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (trRIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to simultaneously track the collective spin (paramagnon) and charge (acoustic plasmon) dynamics in an optimally electron-doped cuprate driven out-of-equilibrium by a femtosecond pump laser pulse. Upon pumping, we observed an anti-Stokes signal associated with paramagnon generation, which modifies the paramagnon dispersion near the zone center, though the bandwidth remained unchanged, suggesting no significant alteration to spin exchange interactions. Simultaneously, in the charge sector, the acoustic plasmon's energy and spectral weight decreased, suggesting a light-induced redistribution of charge carriers. The variations of both the paramagnon and the plasmon were locked in time, demonstrating a robust intertwining between the spin and charge degrees of freedom on a femtosecond timescale, even in this non-equilibrium state.</p>

            <h2>Protected valley splitting against interface disorder toward scalable silicon electron spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Gang Wang, Shan Guan, Jun-Wei Luo, Shu-Shen Li</p>
            <p>Regardless of various material design strategies, experimentally achieving substantial and controllable valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells remains a central challenge for ensuring high gate uniformity. This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase transitions of the anisotropic Dicke-Ising model in driven Rydberg arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao-Yun Dong, Ying Liang, Stefano Chesi, Xue-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.</p>

            <h2>Incommensurate-Stabilized Fractional Chern Insulator in Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moru Song, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) typically emerge in topological flat bands and are regarded as lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.</p>

            <h2>Is the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene zero?: The case for a rational definition of the properties of atoms in a molecule</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devin M. Mulvey, Kenneth D. Jordan, Alston J. Misquitta</p>
            <p>It is generally assumed that the carbon atoms of graphitic samples and their finite analogs have sizable quadrupole moments, with the out-of-plane component ($Q^{\rm C}_{20}$ in traceless spherical coordinates) being the dominate contribution. However, there is no consensus on what the quantity is for such carbon-based systems and values reported in the literature range from $Q^{\rm C}_{20} \sim -1.14$ to $+0.79$ a.u. In this work we propose a theoretical framework in which well-defined statements can be made about properties of atoms-in-a-molecule (AIMs) even when these properties are not experimentally observable. Using this framework and the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA), we show that the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used. We explain how the experimentally measured atomic quadrupole moment of a graphite sample determined by Whitehouse \& Buckingham likely originated almost entirely from edge dipoles, and we propose a more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes.</p>

            <h2>Simulations of inertial liquid-lens coalescence with the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingguang Xie, Jens Harting</p>
            <p>The coalescence of liquid lenses is relevant in various applications, including inkjet printing and fog harvesting. However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\theta < 40^{\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition.</p>

            <h2>Bubble-Driven Flow Transitions in Evaporating Active Droplets on Structured Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meneka Banik, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>The evaporation of particle-laden droplets on engineered surfaces underpins a wide range of technologies, from printed electronics to biosensing. While the influence of substrate topography on passive particle deposition is well established, the combined effects of active matter dynamics, catalytic gas generation, and surface structuring remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the drying of aqueous droplets containing Janus particles (polystyrene-platinum, PS-Pt) on topographically patterned substrates in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) fuel. The catalytic decomposition of H2O2 produces oxygen bubbles within the droplet, introducing strong, transient hydrodynamic perturbations that compete with evaporation driven capillary flows and contact line interactions. We show that bubble activity alters particle transport, leading to distinct and tunable final morphologies not achievable with passive suspensions. This study demonstrates how bubble-induced flow coupled with substrate topography determines deposition patterns during droplet evaporation. Our findings open a route to harnessing active matter and reaction driven flows for directed particle assembly.</p>

            <h2>Photoionization current spectroscopy of individual silicon vacancies in silicon carbide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Okajima, Tetsuri Nishikawa, Hiroshi Abe, Koichi Murata, Takeshi Ohshima, Hidekazu Tsuchida, Naoya Morioka, Norikazu Mizuochi</p>
            <p>Defect charge-state dynamics are central to both spin-photon interfaces and photoelectrical spin readout. Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements. Our results establish photocurrent spectroscopy as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing the development of defect-based quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Impact of a Fano resonance on the measured transition time scale in solid state photoemission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Guo, Dmitry Usanov, Eduardo B. Guedes, Arnaud Magrez, Michele Puppin, J. Hugo Dil</p>
            <p>Fundamental quantum transition time scales are accessible through the spin polarization of photoelectrons coming from initially spin-degenerate states for solid-state materials . In this work we investigate the modification of this time scale in the vicinity of a Fano resonance in photoemission from a solid. We employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) to study the valence band of 1T-TiSe$_2$ and 1T-TiTe$_2$, with an excitation photon energy coinciding with the Ti 3p-3d autoionization state. The energy derivative of the measured spin polarization, which is in the off-resonance case proportional to the transition time, reveals a sign reversal and significant magnitude decrease compared to off-resonance measurements. We show that this effect goes beyond conventional semi-analytical models used to translate spin polarization to the EWS time delay. At the Fano resonance, the underlying interference assumption of the model breaks down, and additional information about resonance strength is needed to extract the transition time delays.</p>

            <h2>Equivalence of residual entropy of hexagonal and cubic ices from tensor network methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia-Ze Xu, Tong-Yu Lin, Guang-Ming Zhang</p>
            <p>The long-standing question of whether the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ($S_h$) equals that of cubic ice ($S_c$) remains unresolved despite decades of research on ice-type models. While analytical studies have established the inequality $S_h \geq S_c$, numerical investigations suggest that the two values are very close. In this work, we revisit this problem using high-precision tensor-network methods. In Monte Carlo approaches the residual entropy cannot be directly obtained by sampling the ground-state degeneracy space, however, the tensor-network framework enables an explicit encoding of the "ice rule'' into local tensors, and then the residual entropy is transformed into finding the largest eigenvalue of a transfer operator in the form of a projected entangled-pair operator, which allows high-accuracy numerical evaluation. Meanwhile, we propose a new perspective based on analyzing the normality of the transfer operator, and demonstrate that if the operator is normal, the equality $S_h = S_c$ follows directly. Then the variational tensor network methods are employed to numerically verify this normality. Finally both residual entropies are directly computed by using our recently developed split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, providing a rigorous evidence supporting the equality between $S_h$ and $S_c$.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive optical characterization of 200-nm-thick CrN(111) films grown simultaneously on Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) and AlN/Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, spanning the far-infrared to ultraviolet range (0.04 - 5.5 eV), is conducted at room temperature to determine the optical constants $n$ and $k$ of the films. Spectral fits reveal two interband transitions at approximately 0.35 and 0.60 eV. In the infrared range, the ellipsometry data also reveals a pronounced Reststrahlen band stemming from transversal and longitudinal optical phonons at approximately 403 and 629 cm$^{-1}$, respectively. The relative static and high-frequency permittivities are estimated to be about 39 and 15, respectively. A Born effective charge of approximately 2.7, extracted from the far-infrared region, indicates that CrN is partially ionic.</p>

            <p>The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we set up a screening procedure on the Energy-GNoME database for identifying novel cathode candidates. We use MACE foundational models as a first layer of screening, we assess dynamical stability and estimate the average voltage and gravimetric energy density. Following that, we apply physically motivated reasoning to identify the most promising candidates. Furthermore, we refine the average voltage prediction of selected promising candidates using DFT+U and provide the list of selected materials using this protocol. This work delivers two key outcomes: validation of the foundational MACE models high-throughput screening approach and suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation batteries. Finally, a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy GNoME database is demonstrated on the examined materials.</p>

            <p>We explore the magnetic properties of Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ single crystals subjected to pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T using magnetization and magnetocaloric-effect (MCE) measurements, with initial temperatures ranging from 2 to 31K. The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. However, it fails to reproduce the plateau seen in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. Agreement with Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ data is improved substantially if we allow the thermal coupling between the magnetic and the lattice subsystems to depend on the product $\frac{HdH}{dt}$. Our results reveal anomalously slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems and point toward a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ via the rate of magnetic field variation.</p>

            <h2>Statistical characterization of the spin Hall magnetoresistance in YIG/Pt heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denise Reustlen, Sebastian Sailler, Davina U. Schmidt, Richard Schlitz, Michaela Lammel, Sebastian T. B. Goennenwein</p>
            <p>The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is widely used to study the interplay between charge and spin currents in bilayers of a magnetic insulator and a normal metal. However, not much is known about the spatial variation of the SMR across the surface of one and the same sample. In this work, we investigate the statistical distribution of the SMR in hundreds of nominally identical Hall bar structures patterned into prototypical yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Pt heterostructures. We find a Gaussian-distributed SMR with a narrow standard deviation of approximately 10$\,$% of the mean value in each YIG/Pt bilayer studied. However, the variation of the mean SMR between different YIG/Pt samples can be as large as ~30$\,$%, despite nominally identical fabrication conditions. This demonstrates that spatial variations of the SMR amplitude must not be neglected, in particular when comparing different heterostructures. On a microscopic level, local variations of the interface quality captured by the spin mixing conductance are the most likely origin for the observed SMR amplitude variations.</p>

            <h2>Deconstructing symmetry breaking dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek</p>
            <p>The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</p>

            <p>High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance. In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes. Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</p>

            <h2>Anomalous scaling and phase transition in large deviations of dynamical observables of stationary Gaussian processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Valov, Baruch Meerson</p>
            <p>We study large deviations, over a long time window $T \to \infty$, of the dynamical observables $A_n = \int_{0}^{T} x^n(t) dt$, $n=3,4,\dots$, where $x(t)$ is a centered stationary Gaussian process in continuous time. We show that, for short-correlated processes the probability density of $A_n$ exhibits an anomalous scaling $P(A_n,T) \sim \exp[-T^{\mu} f_n(\Delta A_n T^{-\nu})]$ at $T\to \infty$ while keeping $\Delta A_n T^{-\nu}$ constant. Here $\Delta A_n$ is the deviation of $A_n$ from its ensemble average. The anomalous exponents $\mu$ and $\nu$ depend on $n$ and are smaller than $1$, whereas the rate function $f_n(z)$ exhibits a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT) which resembles condensation transitions observed in many systems. The same type of anomaly and DPT, with the same $\mu$ and $\nu$, was previously uncovered for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - the only stationary Gaussian process which is also Markovian. We also uncover an anomalous behavior and a similar DPT in the long-correlated Gaussian processes. However, the anomalous exponents $\mu$ and $\nu$ are determined in this case not only by $n$ but also by the power-law long-time decay $\sim |t|^{-\alpha}$ of the covariance. The different anomalous scaling behavior is a consequence of a faster-than-linear scaling with $T$ of the variance of $A_n$. Finally, for sufficiently long-ranged correlations, $\alpha<2/n$, the DPT disappears, giving way to a smooth crossover between the regions of typical, Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations. The basic mechanism behind the DPT is the existence of strongly localized optimal paths of the process conditioned on very large $A_n$ and coexistence between the localized and delocalized paths of the conditioned process. Our theoretical predictions are corroborated by replica-exchange Wang-Landau simulations where we could probe probability densities down to $10^{-200}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong-Yu Bao, Gong Cheng, Hong-Hao Song, Zheng-Cheng Gu</p>
            <p>Recent progress in generalized symmetry and topological holography has shown that, in conformal field theory (CFT), topological data from one dimensional higher can play a key role in determining local dynamics. Based on this insight, a fixed-point (FP) tensor complex (TC) for CFT has recently been constructed. In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields. Remarkably, even when starting solely from topological data, the RG process can still reconstruct the full FP tensor--a method we call as topological bootstrap. This approach deepens the connection between the topological and dynamical aspects of CFT and suggests pathways toward a fully algebraic description of gapless quantum states, with potential extensions to higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>Understanding structure-property relationships in materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics and materials science. Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing this understanding and accelerating materials discovery. Early ML approaches primarily focused on constructing and screening large material spaces to identify promising candidates for various applications. More recently, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward generating crystal structures using end-to-end generative models. This review analyzes the current state of generative modeling for crystal structure prediction and \textit{de novo} generation. It examines crystal representations, outlines the generative models used to design crystal structures, and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the review highlights experimental considerations for evaluating generated structures and provides recommendations for suitable existing software tools. Emerging topics, such as modeling disorder and defects, integration in advanced characterization, and incorporating synthetic feasibility constraints, are explored. Ultimately, this work aims to inform both experimental scientists looking to adapt suitable ML models to their specific circumstances and ML specialists seeking to understand the unique challenges related to inverse materials design and discovery.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Acoustic and Optical Phonon Dispersion Mediated by Berry Curvature in Chiral Weyl Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghita Sengupta</p>
            <p>We investigate the phonon magnetochiral effect (PMCE) in chiral Weyl semimetals by deriving the nonreciprocal dispersion relations of both acoustic and non-polar optical phonons in the presence of a magnetic field. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann kinetic framework that incorporates Berry curvature, orbital magnetic moment, and node-dependent electronic structure, we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetic-field-induced corrections to the phonon dynamical matrix. Inequivalent Weyl nodes with distinct Fermi velocities, Fermi energies, and relaxation times generate a dynamical chiral imbalance that alters the phonon dispersion. For acoustic phonons, the formalism yields the magnetic-field-dependent corrections to the longitudinal mode, while for optical phonons we identify an optical analogue of the PMCE that produces a corresponding shift in the optical branch. Together, these results provide a unified theoretical description of how band-geometric properties of Weyl fermions influence both acoustic and optical phonon dispersions in chiral Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyang Gu, Adrian Diaz, Yang Li, Youping Chen</p>
            <p>This work presents a finite element method for simulating dynamic processes that involve the coupled evolution of dislocation motion and crack propagation. The method numerically solves the Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) formulation of the conservation of linear momentum. A crystalline material is discretized at the unit-cell level using 6-node prism elements whose geometry allows dislocations and cracks to nucleate and propagate along element facets. Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior. Under plane-strain conditions the Cu model fractures in a brittle manner, while a fully three-dimensional model exhibits curved and intersecting dislocations that blunt the crack tip and prevent crack propagation, resulting in ductile behavior. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the method are discussed.</p>

            <p>To study the impact of active systems on their surroundings, we introduce a model that couples an active nematic fluid to an isotropic substrate fluid via friction. We numerically show that as the active layer develops turbulence, the substrate inherits the chaotic behaviour, exhibiting a novel form of turbulence driven by locally generated stochastic forcing from the active layer. In particular, the short-length-scale flow structures in the active layer are filtered out, so the system behaves as a de facto low-pass filter. We derive analytically the transfer function between the two layers and use it to predict the large-q decay of the substrate energy spectrum, and to investigate how tensorial quantities, such as the strain rate and the active stresses, are transmitted between the active layer and the substrate. Our analysis agrees with recent experiments measuring velocity-velocity correlations in mixtures of active and passive microtubules, and it may have implications for traction force microscopy measurements in cellular layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubhanshu Karoliya, Sumanta Tewari, Gargee Sharma</p>
            <p>Topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted intense interest due to their potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation (TQC). Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.</p>

            <p>We reveal the emergence of a robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity (vHS). This noncoplanar, gapped spin configuration -- featuring four orthogonal moments -- has been previously identified as a candidate instability. Here, not only do we confirm its stability across all finite interactions using fully self-consistent, real-space-resolved calculations, but we also go beyond earlier work by charting the full surrounding phase diagram. In doing so, we unravel a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states -- pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures -- which we classify using spin structure factors and vector order parameters. These results stem from unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, enabling us to resolve interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities. Our findings connect directly with recent ARPES and doping experiments near the vHS in graphene, and establish the tetrahedral state as the central correlated instability in this regime, offering predictive insight into emergent magnetism in correlated Dirac materials.</p>

            <p>The directed motion of active colloids is governed by spatial variations in surface chemistry and interfacial stress, yet these properties remain extremely difficult to measure directly. We introduce a physics-informed neural network framework that infers the slip distribution driving propulsion from partial observations of the surrounding flow. By combining sparse fluid velocity measurements with the Stokes equations and boundary constraints, the method reconstructs both the near-surface slip and the full velocity and pressure fields. Validation against analytical solutions and Boundary Element Method calculations for canonical active colloid models shows quantitative agreement in both unbounded and confined geometries. Crucially, the framework recovers the surface slip even when no flow data are available near the particle, demonstrating that accessible bulk measurements encode the interfacial stresses responsible for active motion. These results establish physics-informed inference as a powerful tool for characterizing and ultimately controlling interfacially driven transport in colloidal active matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Karageorgiou, Angelos Michaelides, Fabian Berger</p>
            <p>Reactive dopant atoms embedded in inert host metal surfaces define the active sites in single-atom alloys (SAAs), yet SAA synthesis remains challenging. To address this, we elucidate how dopant adatoms deposited on Cu and Ag surfaces become incorporated into the metal and identify periodic trends from early to late transition metals (TMs) using density functional theory. Adatoms diffuse nearly freely across terraces, as diffusion barriers are small, whereas direct incorporation into terraces is unfavourable. In line with conventional wisdom, step edges and kink sites strongly facilitate dopant incorporation, confirming their critical role in alloy formation. Attachment of adatoms to steps and kinks from the lower terrace is favoured. Incorporation then proceeds either from this attached state or when adatoms approach a step edge from above, where reactions often proceed without barrier. Incorporation barriers are generally lower for early and central TMs, increase towards late TMs, and are slightly higher on Cu than on Ag surfaces. Repulsive interactions between Pd adatoms and dopants explain the experimental observation that a dopant-rich brim on the upper terrace of Cu surfaces inhibits incorporation from above. In contrast, attractive interactions, as found for Ru, anchor diffusing adatoms (even on terraces) and promote the formation of adatom islands, yet hinder incorporation next to the dopant and may impede the growth of embedded dopant clusters. By rationalising periodic trends and experimental observations, we show how specific surface sites and adatom--dopant interactions shape dopant incorporation, offering guidance on the surface environments most conducive to SAA synthesis for different dopant elements.</p>

            <p>Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($\alpha$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $\alpha$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $\alpha$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.</p>

            <p>We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximo T. Estrada</p>
            <p>Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Banerjee, Harley D. Scammell, Mathias S. Scheurer</p>
            <p>There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>Beyond conventional electric and magnetic monopoles, electric and magnetic toroidal monopoles, which are rank-0 multipoles distinguished by opposite parities under spatial inversion and time reversal, can exist in nature. The recent observation of electric-field-induced directional dichroism in antiferromagnetic olivine Co$_2$SiO$_4$ has provided the first concrete example of a magnetic toroidal monopole; however, its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here, we propose a minimal spin model that incorporates magnetoelectric coupling via the $d$-$p$ hybridization mechanism and analyze it within the mean-field approximation. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and its pronounced sensitivity to the direction of the applied electric field. Furthermore, it elucidates the temperature evolution of the magnetic toroidal monopole and the strong electric-field-direction dependence of the magnetic toroidal moment. Our calculations also predict a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response, consistent with the symmetry classification of Co$_2$SiO$_4$ as an altermagnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same framework is applicable to other antiferromagnetic olivines with analogous magnetic order, indicating the robustness and generality of the toroidal-type magnetoelectric response in this material family.</p>

We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.</p>

            <p>Pb-based perovskites with multiple cations are fascinating materials showing various phenomena such as high piezoelectric, electromechanical, and relaxor properties. While chemical disordering accompanied by polar nanoregions and nanosized domains is commonly believed to cause the relaxor nature, little is known about ferroelectric microstructures of chemically ordered Pb-based perovskites. In this study, we discovered intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains in chemically ordered ferroelectric Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$ using in-situ transmission electron microscopy with dark-field imaging. Observation results demonstrate that electric polarization can fluctuate around the [111] direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, which results in unique weak relaxor properties. In-situ imaging upon heating successfully reveals the dynamic behavior of domain-wall movements with lattice distortion and paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition.

While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.</p>

            <h2>Ready-to-Use Polymerization Simulations Combining Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential with Time-Dependent Bond Boosting for Polymer and Interface Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hodaka Mori, Shunsuke Tonogai, Yu Miyazaki, Akihide Hayashi, Masayoshi Takayanagi</p>
            <p>Although polymerization and curing reactions govern the performance of advanced materials, their simulation remains challenging owing to the need for accurate, transferable potentials and rarity of chemical events. Conventional reactive force fields such as ReaxFF require system-specific parametrization, while universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) exhibit limited sampling efficiency. This paper introduces a novel simulation framework integrating a uMLIP with a time-dependent bond-boost scheme. The bias potential increases monotonically with time, and the use of a unified parameter set across reaction classes enables consistent acceleration without system-specific tuning. For radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, the proposed framework reproduces characteristic trends, such as linear molecular-weight growth with conversion, initiator-concentration scaling, and relative monomer reactivity trends. For step-growth polycondensation of nylon-6,6, it captures the characteristic sharp increase in molecular weight at high conversion rates, consistent with experimental behavior. For epoxy curing at a copper substrate, it reveals interfacial ring-opening and cross-linking events, consistent with spectroscopic evidence of Cu-O-C bond formation. Overall, coupling uMLIPs with time-dependent bond boost enables practical and transferable simulations of polymerization and curing processes. The proposed framework reliably resolves mechanistic pathways and relative reactivity, offering molecular-level insights into polymer growth and interfacial adhesion.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating Mechanical Property Prediction across Material Classes using Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Universal Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin Stracke, Connor W. Edwards, Jack D. Evans</p>
            <p>We assess the accuracy of six universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for predicting the temperature and pressure response of materials by molecular dynamics simulations. Accuracy is evaluated across 13 diverse materials (nine metal-organic frameworks and four inorganic compounds), computing bulk modulus, thermal expansion, and thermal decomposition. These MLIPs employ three different architectures (graph neural networks, graph network simulators, and graph transformers) with varying training datasets. We observe qualitative accuracy across these predictions but systematic underestimation of bulk modulus and overestimation of thermal expansion across all models, consistent with potential energy surface softening. From all tested models, three top performers arise; `MACE-MP-0a', `fairchem_OMAT', and `Orb-v3', with average error across metrics and materials of 41%, 44%, and 47%, respectively. Despite strong overall performance, questions arise about the limits of model transferability: dataset homogeneity and structural representation dominate model accuracy. Our results show that certain architectures can compensate for biases, a step closer to truly universal MLIPs.</p>

            <h2>Order-Disorder in Fe-Si Alloys: Implications for Seismic Anisotropy and Thermal Evolution of Earth's Inner Core</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Liu, Xin Deng, R. E. Cohen</p>
            <p>Understanding the structure and dynamics of Earth's inner core is essential for constraining its composition, thermal evolution, and seismic properties. Silicon is a probable major component of Earth's core. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic modeling, we investigate the structural, elastic, and transport properties of Fe-Si alloys at high pressures and temperatures. By computing the Gibbs free energies of B2, hcp, fcc, and bcc solid solutions, we construct the Fe-Si phase diagram applicable to the Earth's inner core. Our results reveal a pronounced miscibility gap between hcp and B2 Fe-Si, with the two phases coexisting over the compositional range of 6-11 wt% Si at 6000 K. The B2 Fe-Si alloy exhibits strong single-crystal shear anisotropy (22.9% at 6000 K) compared to the nearly isotropic hcp phase (0.6%), and yields a shear wave velocity (3.73 km/s) and Poisson's ratio consistent with seismological observations. Moreover, the computed transport properties reveal substantially lower thermal conductivity of B2 Fe-Si relative to pure iron or hcp Fe-Si under inner-core conditions. These results imply that Earth's inner core likely comprises multiple phases, whose distribution and crystallographic texture critically influence its seismic and thermal properties.</p>

            <p>Soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) is one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques to visualize the three-dimensional bulk electronic structure in reciprocal lattice space. Compared with ARPES employing low-energy photon sources, the time burden imposed by a lower photoelectron yield, stemming from the photoionization cross-section, has been a persistent technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES ({\mu}SX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the {\mu}SX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in {\mu}SX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold. Our developed system successfully reduces the time burden in SX-ARPES and paves the way for advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements, such as those requiring higher energy resolution and three-dimensional nonequilibrium measurements.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Ultra-Broadband Frequency Comb in Strongly Bistable Nonlinear Magnonic Resonator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Jiang, Vasyl Tyberkevych, Yizhong Huang, Zixin Yan, Amin Pishehvar, Andrei Slavin, Xufeng Zhang</p>
            <p>Magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) offer a promising route to compact, energy-efficient platforms for on-chip coherent microwave signal generation and processing. Conventional on-chip comb generation typically relies on nonlinear resonators supporting a series of equidistant, low-loss resonances driven by a strong monochromatic signal, resulting in fixed comb spacing defined by the resonator's free spectral range (FSR). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing.</p>

From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening.

Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena at millielectronvolt (terahertz-frequency) energy scales, including superconducting and correlation-induced insulating gaps that are frequently accompanied by symmetry breaking. However, due to the subwavelength dimensions and the often low conductivities of these systems, their intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps are difficult to access experimentally. Here we report an optical readout method that can image propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time. The method relies on a strong coupling between the optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and the local THz fields in a waveguide, which enables us to image THz plasmons with micron scale spatial resolution and determine their propagation group velocities. Moreover, at finite magnetic fields, we observe coherent cyclotron oscillations resulting from Landau level repopulation induced by the THz field. Our findings provide a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors and enable "all-photonic" TMD-based architectures for time-domain THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Generation of concurrence in a generalized central spin model with a three-spin interacting environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya A. Vasista, Anushka Agrawal, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.</p>

            <h2>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tozar</p>
            <p>We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</p>

            <p>ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</p>

            <p>Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.</p>

            <p>Excitons, the correlated electron-hole pairs governing optical and transport properties in organic semiconductors, have long resisted direct experimental access to their full quantum-mechanical wave functions. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (trPOT), combining high-harmonic probe pulses with time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, to directly image the momentum-space distribution and ultrafast dynamics of excitons in $\alpha$-sexithiophene thin films. We introduce a quantitative model that enables reconstruction of the exciton wave function in real space, including both its spatial extent and its internal phase structure. The reconstructed wave function reveals coherent delocalization across approximately three molecular units and exhibits a characteristic phase modulation, consistent with ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Time-resolved measurements further show a $\sim 20$\% contraction of the exciton radius within 400 fs, providing direct evidence of self-trapping driven by exciton-phonon coupling. These results establish trPOT as a general and experimentally accessible approach for resolving exciton wave functions -- with spatial, phase, and temporal sensitivity -- in a broad class of molecular and low-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells experienced a significant increase in efficiency, making them viable for industrial applications. Among the various scalable and industry-compatible metal halide perovskite deposition techniques, co-evaporation stands out as particularly well-suited for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells due to its ability to conformally cover textured silicon bottom cells. Solution-processed [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz) is commonly used as a hole-transporting material for co-evaporated metal halide perovskites. However, we show that it covers the textured surface of silicon bottom cells unevenly, impacting the film growth and leading to the formation of residual PbI2 at the buried interface. The present study reveals via X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) that a CsCl seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface, even in the areas with a thin MeO-2PACz layer, thereby preventing the formation of interfacial PbI2 and leading to larger apparent grains. The improvement of the metal halide perovskite film quality on the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface and the bulk perovskite film led to 30.3% (29.7% certified) efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. The present work highlights the importance of a seed layer for a robust growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite and represents an important milestone for the transfer of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells from laboratory to industry.</p>

            <p>We realize strongly confined quantum dots (QDs) in InAs nanowires (NWs) by combining epitaxial crystal-phase control with chemical wet etching. A strong axial confinement is first introduced by growing closely spaced wurtzite (WZ) tunnel barriers in NWs to enclose a zinc blende (ZB) QD. The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy > 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control.</p>

            <p>Knots, characterized by topological invariants called the Hopf number $H$, arise from the intertwining of strings and exhibit diverse configurations. The knot structures have recently been observed in condensed matters, as examplified by a magnetic hopfion, sparking interest in controlling their topology. Here, we show that spin-orbit torque (SOT) enables dynamic manipulation of the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions. We investigate the SOT-driven evolution of hopfions, revealing the splitting of a high-$H$ hopfion into multiple lower-$H$ ones, a process that can be quantified by an effective tension picture. Comparative analysis across different $H$ uncovers a hierarchy of instabilities that dictates these dynamical topological transitions. These findings establish SOT as a powerful tool for controlling hopfion topology, paving the way for potential applications in topological memory devices.</p>

Across all four members, we find indirect bandgaps with extrema near $\Gamma$, sizable spin splittings at both band edges, and robust in-plane ferroelectric polarization that stabilizes out-of-plane persistent spin textures (PSTs). Crucially, polarization reversal switches the spin orientation, enabling electrical control of PSTs and thereby non-volatile manipulation of spin states. These results establish (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ as a versatile materials platform where compositional design and ferroelectric switching jointly enable spintronic functionality.</p>

            <p>Hopfions--three-dimensional topological solitons with knotted spin texture--have recently garnered attention in topological magnetism due to their unique topology characterized by the Hopf number $H$, a topological invariant derived from knot theory. In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching.</p>

The developed theoretical approach allows accounting for arbitrary nanoparticle size-distribution and the microscopic line broadening mechanisms for the optical phonons. The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods.

            <p>Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.</p>

The ground-state energy results from a competition between confinement, elasticity and disorder. We obtain an exact description of the large deviation rate function with speed $NL^d$ and its different phases, corresponding to different patterns of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results show that the ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem and we obtain an explicit expression for the rescaled variance. In the (massless) limit of zero confinement, this variance vanishes for short-range disorder and the ground-state energy displays super-concentration. From our results on the large deviation function, we characterise explicitly the left tail of the distribution of the typical fluctuations of the ground state energy.

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides provide a platform for exploring spin-valley physics, offering a promising approach to electric-field-driven spin control for low-power spintronic and quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced spin splitting in the Q and Q' valleys of multilayer n-type WSe2 using quantum-point-contact spectroscopy. Systematic modulations in four distinct conductance quantization steps, providing direct evidence of spin-valley-layer coupling-driven spin-resolved density of states, were achieved by tuning the out-of-plane gate voltage. Notably, the electric-field-induced spin splitting significantly dominated the magnetic-field-induced Zeeman effect (e.g., ~ 6 meV for a displacement field change of ~ 0.04 V/nm vs. ~ 1 meV for a magnetic field of 9 T), demonstrating a powerful, non-magnetic manipulation of spin states. This ability to manipulate spin states by gate voltage is crucial for advancing next-generation low-power spintronic and quantum information technologies.</p>

            <h2>A cascade model for the defect-driven etching of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Thornley, Maruf Sarkar, Saptarsi Ghosh, Martin Frentrup, Menno J. Kappers, Thom R. Harris-Lee, Rachel A. Oliver</p>
            <p>Fabrication of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) via the selective electrochemical etching (ECE) of conductive Si-doped layers, separated by non-intentionally doped (NID) layers, provides a straightforward methodology for producing highly reflective DBRs suitable for device overgrowth and integration, which has otherwise proven difficult in the III-nitride epitaxial system via conventional alloying. Such photonic materials can be fabricated by a lithography-free defect-driven etching process, where threading dislocations intrinsic to heteroepitaxy form nanoscale channels that facilitate etchant transport through NID layers. Here, we report the first three-dimensional characterisation of porous GaN-on-Si DBRs fabricated in this methodology with different ECE voltages, using serial-section tomography in a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). These datasets reconstruct the pore morphology as etching proliferates through the alternating Si-doped/NID layer stack. Volumetric reconstruction enabled us to enhance the established `kebab' model for defect-driven etching by proposing a `cascade' model where etchant cascades through the material via vertical etching down nanopipes and horizontal etching across pores, forming complex networks directly related to the pathways taken. This accounts for premature nanopipe termination and discontinuities in nanopipe formation, where dislocations are observed to activate and deactivate individually. Statistical analysis of individual etching behaviour, across all dislocations for each tomograph, revealed a greater tendency to form continuous structures that follow conventional kebab behaviour at higher ECE voltages. We propose that higher ECE voltages alter the probability of dislocation etching relative to doped layer etching, thereby empowering morphological optimization through improved mechanistic understanding of ECE.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-induced frequency shift in semiconductor spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irina Heinz, Jeroen Danon, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.</p>

            <p>Trions, three-body bound states composed of an exciton and an additional charge, are typically fragile and require external excitation to form. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</p>

            <p>Neuromorphic computing is at the basis of the recent progress in artificial intelligence. But the progress is accompanied with increasing demands in computational resources and power supply. Reservoir neuromorphic computing uses a non-linear physical system to replace a part of a large neural network. The advantages can include reduced power consumption and faster learning. We show that the interference in an organic crystal waveguide resonator leads to efficient separation of optical patterns, allowing a significant reduction of the size of the neural network and an acceleration of the learning process. For more complex symbols, extending the reservoir output dimension thanks to spin-orbit coupling, we achieve a 10-times reduction of the network size and a 3-fold speedup. Our work suggests a general path for the performance improvement of photonic reservoir computing systems.</p>

            <p>In this study, the dynamic oxidation state changes of pure Pt and 50at% PtPd alloy catalysts were investigated during a temperature ramp from 80 to 450 C under a reactive gas mixture of 500 ppm NO and 3 % Oxygen in Nitrogen atmosphere. These changes are closely correlated with variations in NO conversion efficiency. Sharp tip specimens were prepared from Pt and PtPd alloy wires by electrochemical polishing and Focused Ion Beam annular milling, with the hemispherical apex serving as a model for nanoscale catalyst surfaces. The samples were exposed to the reactive atmosphere in a dedicated reaction chamber and subsequently analyzed using atom probe tomography. Effective oxide thicknesses and three-dimensional surface morphology were quantitatively evaluated. A pronounced decrease in oxide thickness was observed during the first cooling and second heating cycles, particularly below 200 C, indicating reversible redox behavior on both Pt and PtPd alloy surfaces. This behavior correlates with the inverse hysteresis of NO conversion measured for both systems, suggesting that the redox reversibility is driven primarily by reaction kinetics rather than thermodynamic stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihan Wu, Mario Caserta, Tommaso Chiarotti, Nicola Marzari</p>
            <p>We study the electronic structure and dynamical correlations in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, a prototypical room-temperature multiferroic, using a variety of static and dynamical first-principles methods. Conventional static Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$) incorrectly predict a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak (around $-7\,\text{eV}$) in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, in contradiction with hard-X-ray photoemission. We resolve this failure by using a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include a frequency-dependent screening -- DFT+$U(\omega)$ -- or using a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(\omega)$, computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals, is expressed as a sum-over-poles, yielding a self-energy that augments the Kohn--Sham Hamiltonian. This DFT+$U(\omega)$ approach predicts a fundamental band gap of $1.53\,\text{eV}$, consistent with experiments, and completely eliminates the unphysical deep-valence peak. The resulting simulated HAXPES spectrum reproduces the experimental lineshape with an accuracy matching or exceeding that of far more demanding DFT+DMFT calculations. Our work demonstrates the critical nature of dynamical screening in complex oxides and establishes DFT+$U(\omega)$ as a predictive, computationally efficient method for correlated materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Mihatsch, Andreas M. Menzel</p>
            <p>The transport of individual entities through interconnected structures is a process of practical relevance both in biology and technology. Examples are given by diffusive dynamics of molecules in porous structures. In soft environments, this transport can be strongly influenced by fluctuations of the porous structure itself. Here, we focus on triply periodic membrane structures found both in cell organelles and in synthetic amphiphilic systems. We theoretically study the effect of a complex three-dimensional fluctuating environment on the diffusive motion of a test object, using a phase field approach. The rigid spherical test object is energetically forced to not penetrate the membrane. Generally, the pores of the membrane structure can be smaller than the diffusing object. Yet, fluctuations of the membrane can intermittently widen its pores, still allowing for the motion of the larger particles through them. Thus, the object stays trapped for a while inside one cavity formed by the membrane, before an appropriate fluctuation event widens a membrane pore in the right moment so that the object can jump into the next cavity. The process is reflected by a pronounced plateau in the time evolution of the mean squared displacement. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the diffusing object on the deformation of the membrane, which leads to an additional increase in the diffusivity. We think that the described scenario should be directly observable, for instance, in protein diffusion through biological environments.</p>

            <h2>A thermodynamic framework for the thermal conductivity of dense fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Hoyuelos</p>
            <p>A thermodynamic framework that predicts the thermal conductivity $\lambda$ of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit is introduced. By generalizing the transition-rate approach of particles on a lattice to conserved quantities in continuous space, an expression for the ratio $\lambda/\lambda_{\rm id}$, with $\lambda_{\rm id}$ the dilute-gas-limit value, is derived; it depends solely on equilibrium thermodynamic properties and is therefore directly computable from any equation of state. The resulting formula quantitatively reproduces molecular-dynamics data for hard spheres throughout almost the entire fluid range, and captures the behavior of Lennard-Jones fluids in the supercritical region where thermodynamic fluctuations remain moderate. Comparison with experimental data for argon, reported by other authors, also shows very good agreement. These results provide evidence that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal thermodynamic factor.</p>

            <p>Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) is a fundamental dynamical phenomenon, ubiquitous in various quantum systems. Here, we propose a time-varying electric circuit to address the question of whether the quantum LZT can occur in classical systems. Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schrödinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our new definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, co-determined by the linear sweeping rate $\alpha'$ and the frequency gap $\Delta$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\exp(-\pi\Delta^2/2\alpha')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Vallini, Laura Foini, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kishan Ray, Carlo Danieli, Alexei Andreanov, Sergej Flach</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic framework for constructing all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice Hamiltonians that explicitly break time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By threading magnetic flux through disconnected polygonal plaquettes and applying local entangling unitary transformations, we map plaquettes onto families of ABF models in one, two, and three dimensions. This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux. We further extend the framework to lattices with coexisting flat and dispersive bands, illustrating cases with both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CLSs. Our results provide a controlled route for generating dispersionless lattices supporting flux-induced local currents.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Shahroze Shahab, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</p>

            <p>Adsorption of surfactants to fluid interfaces occurs in daily-life and technological contexts like dish washing and oil spill remediation. The surfactant surface coverage $\Gamma$ governs interface characteristics like tension $\gamma$, viscoelastic properties, and the stability of thin foam films. Directly measuring $\Gamma$ as a function of the bulk concentration $c$ is highly desirable but challenging, particularly for non-ionic surfactants that lack easily detectable labels. Here, we propose a generic approach to deduce the adsorption isotherm $\Gamma(c)$: As a first step, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of surfactant-loaded air/water interfaces with known $\Gamma$ to obtain interfacial electron density profiles. From these profiles, we then compute theoretical X-ray reflectivity curves, which we compare with experimental measurements to find the matching $c$. We focus on two non-ionic surfactants (C$_{12}$EO$_6$} and $\beta$-C$_{12}$G$_2$}) with previously verified force fields to demonstrate how this combined approach of experiments and simulations can determine the adsorption isotherm. By using the equation of state $\gamma(\Gamma)$ from simulations, our results replicate the measured surface tension isotherms $\gamma(c)$.</p>

In the model, we incorporate a variable bond angle, which allows us to simulate the effect of the in-plane strain. In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $\alpha$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $\alpha$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone.</p>

The dynamics of magnetization is studied numerically within a discretized Landau-Lifshitz equation on a hexagonal lattice containing over $10^5$ sites. Local coordinate frames coupled to the crystallographic axes for each spin are used together with the laboratory coordinate frame. The parameters of a hexagonal close-packed cobalt lattice have been chosen for illustration. The magnetization reversal from a metastable initial state created by the external magnetic field occurs on a time scale of a few picoseconds. Our results imply that fast local elastic twists generated by moving dislocations serve as an important mechanism of magnetization dynamics in solids subjected to a mechanical stress.</p>

            <p>Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.</p>

Differential conductance measurements reveal multiple Andreev reflection peaks, with odd-order peaks split by the spin-splitting induced in the superconductor adjacent to EuS, while even-order peaks remain unaffected. Combining experiments with quasiclassical transport modeling, we extract the spin-splitting and the distribution of transmission channels, finding that a significant fraction ($\sim 23\%$) of highly transparent channels ($\tau \approx 0.9$) dominates transport. The observation of a Josephson current further confirms strong superconducting coupling through these channels. Our results demonstrate that a single spin-split superconductor is sufficient to observe the even-odd MAR effect.

            <p>On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.</p>

            <p>Living cells establish long-range orientational order through collective alignment, giving rise to topological defects whose functional relevance is increasingly recognized in tissue organization and morphogenesis. Engineered topographical patterns have been used to induce such defects in cell monolayers, mimicking natural biological phenomena. In this work, we investigate the effect of cell-surface adhesion on collective cell dynamics at a vortex integer topological defect imposed by a topographical ring pattern. Adhesion strength is controlled via surface functionalization with poly-D-lysine, fibronectin, or covalently bonded fibronectin, and quantified using atomic force microscopy. As surface chemistry is modified, cell morphology changes from irregular to spindle-like, and two distinct collective modes emerge: weakly adhered cells exhibit strong inward motion, while strongly attached cells move tangentially to the ring. Spindle-shaped cells exhibit higher nematic order and promote the emergence of two +1/2 topological defects in the monolayer. We further characterize collective cell dynamics by analyzing correlation lengths and demonstrate the scaling of number density fluctuations in cell systems.</p>

            <h2>Non-local Chemistry Driven by Cation-Anion Size Disparity in Helium Inserted Compounds under High Pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Liu, Stefano Raciopp Katerina P. Hilleke, Abhiyan Pandit, Shuran Ma, Andreas Hermann, Dadong Yan, Eva Zurek, Mao-sheng Miao</p>
            <p>Opposing the theory that Helium (He) cannot be inserted into AB-type ionic compounds due to the Madelung energy increase, our crystal structure search and first-principles calculations found that He can form stable compounds with sodium halides (NaX, X=Cl, Br, I) under high-pressure. These reactions are driven by the non-local chemistry arising from the cation-anion size disparity, distinctly different from the He insertion reaction with A2B-type compounds. The large size differences between Na+ and X- enable structures that can effectively host He insertions through volume and inter-atomic distance disproportionation. Furthermore, the insertion of He atoms can significantly relieve the elevated Madelung energy that builds up in NaX under high pressure. This energy increase arises from structural transitions driven by cation-anion size disparity, which are necessary for reducing volume under pressure. The insertion of He allows the reduction of the total volume under high pressure without increasing the Madelung energy. Our predicted compounds and stability analysis reveal a new example of He reactivity governed not by local chemical bond formation, but by long-range electrostatic interactions.</p>

            <h2>Helix alignment, chevrons, and edge dislocations in twist-bend ferroelectric nematics</h2>

            <p>We explore surface alignment and edge dislocations in the recently discovered twist-bend ferroelectric nematic, NTBF, in which the vector of spontaneous polarization follows an oblique helicoidal trajectory around a polar twist-bend axis. In a planar cell, the polar axis aligns at some angle to the rubbing direction to mitigate surface electric charge. We demonstrate that the pseudolayers in planar cells form chevron defects, a hallmark defect of one-dimensionally positionally ordered phases, such as smectic A and smectic C. The polar character of the twist-bend axis prevents the cores of NTBF edge dislocations from splitting into semi-integer disclinations, in stark contrast to dislocations in paraelectric and ferroelectric chiral nematics. The tilt of pseudolayers around the defect core allows us to estimate the elastic penetration length as being close to the pitch of NTBF. Compression/dilation stresses around the core modify the heliconical tilt angle of molecules as evidenced by a substantial variation in local birefringence. The climb of dislocations exhibits high mobility, allowing the system to equilibrate the temperature-dependent pitch. The uncovered properties facilitate the development of NTBF materials for electro-optical applications, such as electrically controlled diffraction lattices and structural colors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Romano, Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Benoît Mahault, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>We study the behaviour of catalytically active droplets in multi-component conserved mixtures affected by noise. Working in the thin interface limit, we analytically determine the state diagram of the system, characterized by multiple dynamical regimes, and verify our findings using numerical simulations. In particular, we show the emergence of a non-reciprocal, chemically-mediated interaction between the droplets, which leads to the formation of (meta-)stable clusters of droplets of different species. We find that the clusters can display self-propulsion in a large part of the parameter space, including regions where the non-reciprocal interactions between the droplets are purely attractive. This surprising feature arises from the non-local nature of the chemical interactions, and points to locality violations as a general mechanism for energy dissipation and emergence of out-of-equilibrium steady states in active matter.</p>

            <h2>Plasmon excitations and their attenuation in dirty superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil K. Karuzin, Mikhail A. Skvortsov</p>
            <p>We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.</p>

            <h2>Wilson loops, symmetries, and selective bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Aich, Babak Seradjeh (IUB)</p>
            <p>We investigate the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in a family of chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians. These models generalize the $\pi$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.</p>

            <h2>Electronic Transport Switching by Electric field Driven Tautomerism in Single and Fused Metal-free Benziporphyrins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yenni P. Ortiz, Arnau Cortés-Llamas, Jordi Ribas-Arino, Stefan T. Bromley</p>
            <p>The capacity of many metal-free porphyrins (MFPs) to exhibit different H-bonded tautomers provides a platform for exploring the effects of reversible molecular changes on electronic transport. On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating Global Measures of Network Centralization: Axiomatic and Numerical Assessments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Majid Saberi, Samin Aref</p>
            <p>Network centralization, driven by hub nodes, impacts communication efficiency, structural integration, and dynamic processes such as diffusion and synchronization. Although numerous centralization measures exist, a major challenge lies in determining measures that are both theoretically sound and empirically reliable across different network contexts. To resolve this challenge, we normalize 11 measures of network centralization and assess them systematically using an axiomatic framework and numerical simulations. Our axiomatic assessment tests each measure against the six postulates of centralization, ensuring consistency with minimal theoretical requirements. In addition, our numerical assessment examines the behavior of normalized centralization measures over different random graphs. Our results indicate major differences among the measures, despite their common aim of quantifying centralization. Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics.</p>

            <p>We study the mobilization of an oil droplet in a deformable, actuated constricted tube subjected to two different actuation mechanisms: hydrodynamic actuation (oscillatory body force in the fluid) and dynamic wall actuation (oscillatory traction on the tube walls). Using high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations, we analyze the effects of actuation frequency and amplitude on droplet transport through the constriction. Our simulations show that hydrodynamic actuation leads to a monotonic increase in the droplet's mobilization time with increasing actuation frequency, and a decrease with increasing actuation amplitude. In contrast, dynamic wall actuation exhibits a resonance effect-the mobilization time reaches a minimum at a frequency near the tube's resonant frequency. Our study highlights the potential of actuation mechanisms in deformable tubes for precise control of droplet transport in bio-microfluidic applications.</p>

            <p>The active manipulation of topologically protected states represents a pivotal frontier for quantum technologies, offering a unique confluence of topological robustness and precise quantum control. We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.</p>

In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.</p>

            <p>The non-perturbative constraints imposed by intrinsic fermionic non-invertible symmetries in 1+1 dimensional gapped systems remain largely unexplored. In this letter, we propose the superstrip algebra as a unified framework to catalog the categorical symmetry data in a massive fermionic model. The algebra and its representations explicitly encode the vacuum structure, soliton degeneracies, and their quantum numbers. As a demonstration, we apply this framework to the $\mathcal N=2$ minimal models with their least relevant deformation. We show that this specific deformation alone preserves a non-invertible superfusion category, a fermionic variant of $\text{SU}(2)_k$ known to underlie the $ADE$ classification of critical theories. Its superstrip algebra then accounts for the origin of the resulting $ADE$-type soliton spectrum and their fractional fermion number. Although our primary examples are supersymmetric and integrable, our framework itself relies on neither property, providing a new powerful tool for studying a broad class of strongly-coupled fermionic systems.</p>

            <p>Monolayer MoS$_2$ is a direct band gap semiconductor with potential applications in optoelectronics and photonics. MoS$_2$ also has a large optical nonlinearity. However, the atomic thickness of the monolayer limits the strength of the measured functional signals, such as the photocurrent or photoluminescence, in optoelectronic devices. Here, we show that photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$ can be induced by sub-band gap photons by depositing Au nanoparticles on it. In this system, the nonlinear light-matter interaction in Au nanoparticles enhanced by the localized surface plasmons results in the generation of supercontinuum, which is reabsorbed by MoS$_2$ due to efficient resonant energy transfer. Au nanoparticle assisted photocurrent is more than an order of magnitude larger than two-photon photocurrent in monolayer MoS$_2$. Optimization of the shape, size and composition of the nanoparticle has the potential to enhance the photocurrent significantly with the prospect of applications in the detection of NIR photons, and related technologies including optical telecommunication.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fiona Y. Wang, Di Sheng Lee, David L. Kaplan, Markus J. Buehler</p>
            <p>Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.</p>

            <p>An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</p>

In the integrable regime optimal energy storage and extraction are possible irrespective of the initial state of the charger. Finally, we show that the observed advantage does not originate from multipartite entanglement within the battery subsystem and is therefore classical in nature.</p>

            <p>One of the main enablers in quantum computing is having qubit control that is precise and fast. However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), exhibit strong excitonic transitions at room temperature and offer a unique platform for exploring light-matter interactions in nanoscale photonic systems. In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $\mu m^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint. By integrating the hBN photonic structure with a WS$_2$ monolayer, we observe enhanced photoluminescence when its resonance is spectrally aligned with the exciton resonance, accompanied by signatures of discrete momentum-space patterns that identify the orbital-angular-momentum-carrying ring eigenmodes. These features persist over a wide range of excitation powers and show minimal linewidth broadening, indicating robust and spatially modulated exciton-photon coupling. This work establishes a scalable approach for generating hybrid photonic-excitonic states with momentum-space structure, offering new opportunities for exciton localization, valley emission, spatially programmable light-matter interaction in two-dimensional material platforms and compact luminescent devices based on 2D material-integrated metasurfaces.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.</p>

            <p>In this work we derive the replica field theory for monitored quantum many-body systems evolving under the quantum jumps protocol, corresponding to a non-Hermitian evolution interspersed with random quantum jumps whose distribution is state-dependent. We show that the density matrix of $R$ replicas evolves according to a master equation where the non-Hermitian term is replica-diagonal while coupling among replicas are due to quantum jumps. We write down the associated Keldysh action and study its behavior for the specific case of the Ising Chain with monitoring of particle density and tunable anisotropy, interpolating between free fermions with strong U(1) symmetry and the Ising chain with Z$_2$ symmetry. We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state. We then go beyond saddle point and derive the effective field theory describing the replica off-diagonal sector, which takes the form of a Non-Linear Sigma Model. The symmetry class is either DIII or D, depending on the parameters of the Ising chain, except at a special symmetric point, where we recover the results for free fermions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the entangling phase observed numerically for the monitored Ising chain.</p>

We derive three explicit schemes that offer better stability compared to Euler-Maruyama and Milstein's method, and achieve strong convergence up to order O(h) in the time step h. We combine these schemes with a pseudo-spectral approach to outline efficient algorithms for simulating stochastic field theories with additive noise. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code.</p>

            <p>A new component for the accurate simulation of neutron scattering from magnetic excitations has been developed for the neutron ray-tracing software McStas. The component SpinWave_BCO simulates inelastic neutron scattering from ferro-, antiferro-, and altermagnetic excitations in a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure, where the dispersion relation and scattered neutron intensities are derived using linear spin wave theory. Data from a simulated Triple-Axis Spectrometer with an extremely high resolution have been verified by direct comparison with theory and by comparison to data simulated using the package SpinW. The component serves as a proof-of-concept for the implementation of a more general linear spin wave component in McStas.</p>

            <p>Photon-pressure circuits are the circuit implementation of the cavity optomechanical Hamiltonian and discussed for qubit readout, low-frequency quantum photonics and dark matter axion detection. Due to the enormous design flexibility of superconducting circuits, photon-pressure systems provide fascinating possibilities to explore unusual parameter regimes of the optomechanical Hamiltonian. Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure. In addition, both coupling rates are considerably enhanced by nonlinearities of the GHz-mode, which leads to the multi-photon coupling rates scaling stronger with the pump photon number $n_\mathrm{c}$ than the usual $\sqrt{n_\mathrm{c}}$ dependence. We demonstrate that interference of the two interaction paths leads to a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency, and that the dynamical backaction is considerably modified compared to the dispersive case, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone.</p>

            <h2>Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model</h2>

            <p>We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborová 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-Time-Order Correlator Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Fujii</p>
            <p>Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are central probes of quantum scrambling, and their generalizations have recently become key primitives for both benchmarking quantum advantage and learning the structure of Hamiltonians. Yet their behavior has lacked a unified algorithmic interpretation. We show that higher-order OTOCs naturally fit within the framework of quantum signal processing (QSP): each $\mathrm{OTOC}^{(k)}$ measures the $2k$-th Fourier component of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator. This explains the contrasting sensitivities of time-ordered correlators (TOCs) and higher-order OTOCs to causal-cone structure and to chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics. Based on this understanding, we further generalize higher-order OTOCs by polynomial transformation of the singular values of the spatially resolved truncated propagator. The resultant signal allows us to construct frequency-selective filters, which we call \emph{OTOC spectroscopy}. This extends conventional OTOCs into a mode-resolved tool for probing scrambling and spectral structure of quantum many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Hasenfratz, Oliver Witzel</p>
            <p>In recent years tantalizing signs for a novel phase have been reported that is chirally symmetric but nevertheless exhibits massive bound states. The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics.</p>

            <h2>Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Del Gaudio, Federico Ghimenti, Surya Ganguli</p>
            <p>We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</p>

            <p>Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehedi Hasan, Ishtiaq Murshed, Khayrul Islam, A.K.M. Masud</p>
            <p>The development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage requires devices that combine the high energy density of batteries with the power capability and long cycle life of supercapacitors. However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raul Quintero-Monsebaiz, Per Hyldgaard, Elsebeth Schröder</p>
            <p>Understanding photophysical properties of DNA is important: It can help us elucidate and probe the impact of charges and free radicals in the cellular environment. For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.</p>

We designed and realized resilient magnetic soft actuators capable of operating in a tunable dynamic regime for tens of thousands cycles without fatigue. We experimentally demonstrated the application of these actuators for true random number generation and stochastic computing. {W}e validate soft robots as physical reservoirs capable of performing Mackey--Glass time series prediction. These findings show that exploring the complex dynamics in soft robotics would extend the application scenarios in soft computing, human-robot interaction and collaborative robots as we demonstrate with biomimetic blinking and randomized voice modulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Burger, Stephan Rinner, Andreas Gritsch, Kilian Sandholzer, Andreas Reiserer</p>
            <p>Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>A theory for coexistence and selection of branched actin networks in a shared and finite pool of monomers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Wössner, Falko Ziebert, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)</p>
            <p>Cellular actin structures are continuously turned over while keeping similar sizes. Since they all compete for a shared pool of actin monomers, the question arises how they can coexist in these dynamic steady states. Recently, the coexistence of branched actin networks with different densities growing in a shared and finite pool of purified proteins has been demonstrated in a biomimetic bead assay. However, theoretical work in the context of organelle size regulation has mainly been focused on linear architectures, such as single filaments and bundles, and thus is not able to explain this observation. Here we show theoretically that the local depletion of actin monomers caused by the growth of a branched network naturally gives rise to a negative feedback loop between network density and growth rate, and that this competition is captured by one central equation. A comprehensive bifurcation analysis shows that the theory leads to well-defined steady states even in the case of multiple networks sharing the same pool of monomers, without any need for specific molecular processes. Under increasing competition strength, coexistence is replaced by selection. We also show that our theory is in excellent agreement with spatiotemporal simulations implemented in a finite element framework. In summary, our work suggests that local monomer depletion is the decisive and universal factor controlling growth of branched actin networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Yan, Chun Hei Leung, Weibin Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</p>

            <p>We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a<0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a>0$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture under the additional condition that $a>\lambda/3$, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</p>

Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel E. Gralla, Morifumi Mizuno</p>
            <p>In the presence of a strong electric field, the vacuum is unstable to the production of pairs of charged particles -- the Schwinger effect. The created pairs extract energy from the electric field, resulting in nontrivial backreaction. In this paper, we study 1+1D massive QED subject to strong external electric fields in a self-consistent and fully quantum manner. We use the bosonized version of the theory, which attains a cosine interaction term in the presence of nonzero fermion mass $m$. However, the assumption of strong electric field justifies a perturbative treatment of the cosine interaction, i.e., an expansion in $m$. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the electric field to first order in $m$ and show that -- surprisingly -- it satisfies a classical nonlinear partial differential equation (related to the sine-Gordon equation). We show that the electric field exhibits dissipation-free oscillations (analogous to ordinary plasma oscillations) and calculate the plasma frequency analytically. We also compare to the semiclassical approximation commonly used to study backreaction, showing that it fails to capture the $O(m)$ shift in the plasma frequency.</p>

            <p>The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a central ingredient in the construction of quantum dynamics of Brownian motion which necessarily is non-Markovian. Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation sets the universality class for growing and roughening of nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation law and nonlocal effects. We argue here that the KPZ equation can be generalized by including a symmetry-permitted nonlocal nonlinear term of active origin that is of the same order as the one included in the KPZ equation. Including this term, the 2D active KPZ equation is stable in some parameter regimes, in which the interface conformation fluctuations exhibit sublogarithmic or superlogarithmic roughness, with nonuniversal exponents, giving positional generalised quasi-long-ranged order. For other parameter choices, the model is unstable, suggesting a perturbatively inaccessible algebraically rough interface or positional short-ranged order. Our model should serve as a paradigmatic nonlocal growth equation.</p>

This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</p>

We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</p>

This theory was tested for models of frictional interfaces, where long range elastic interactions are present. Here we test it for short-range depinning, and confirm that (i) nucleation is triggered by avalanches, governed by a critical point at some threshold force $f_c$ close to the minimum of the flow curve and that (ii) due to an armouring mechanism by which the elastic manifold displays very little plasticity after a big slip event, very slowly decaying finite size effects dominate the hysteresis magnitude, with an exponent we can relate to other observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yan Shao, Jia-Heng Ji, Congjun Wu, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>Recently, high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ ultrathin film with critical temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit at ambient pressure (AP). It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Chirolli, Angelo Greco, Alessandro Crippa, Elia Strambini, Mario Cuoco, Luigi Amico, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <h2>Path Entropy-driven Design of Solid-State Electrolytes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiye Guan, Kaiyang Wang, Jingjie Yeo, Yongqing Cai</p>
            <p>The development of high-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) has entered a critical stage, where entropy-driven strategies offer transformative potential for enhancing electrochemical properties. By engineering local environments for conductive ions alongside introducing disorder, these approaches can significantly improve conductivity. However, embracing high-entropy designs does not always guarantee improved performance. Current entropy descriptions oversimplify disorder by accounting solely for host framework configurations, neglecting conductive ion-induced disorder, rendering such descriptions incomplete. Herein, we propose path entropy (Sp) as a descriptor that quantifies diffusion pathway diversity, directly capturing diffusional disorder. Combining Markov state model with transition path theory, we reveal the interplay between diffusion pathway diversity of lithium and microscopic local environments in inorganic thiophosphates. Generalizing this path-informative Sp for high-throughput screening, we demonstrate its broad applicability in identifying and designing high-performance SSEs. Our work establishes a critical link between entropy evolution underlying ion conduction and practical entropy-driven design principles.</p>

            <p>The dynamic Stark effect and the Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) are hallmarks of driven two-level systems. We establish a direct correspondence between these quantum phenomena and the parametric normal mode splitting in coupled classical oscillators. This gives rise to a second-subharmonic ATS under a two-tone parametric drive. We find excellent agreement between the theory and the vibrations of a nanomechanical two-mode system, capturing both the fundamental and second-subharmonic ATS, and allowing quantitative extraction of the modal coupling irrespective of the degree of modal hybridization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Kurniawan, Keita Ito, Takeshi Seki, Keisuke Masuda, Yoshio Miura</p>
            <p>Although the relationship between magnetostriction and magnetic damping is often described phenomenologically, their intrinsic connection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the magnitude of magnetic damping depends on the sign of magnetostriction in ($\mathrm{Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{4}N}$ and $\mathrm{Ni_{1-y}Co_{y}}$ alloys across various compositions, consistent with experimental observations. This behavior is attributed to strain-induced changes in exchange splitting, which shift the minority spin density of states near the Fermi level, thereby affecting both magnetostriction and damping through spin-conserving transitions. Additionally, the presence of locally degenerate orbitals plays a crucial role in determining magnetostriction. These findings suggest that magnetization dynamics and magnetostriction can be intrinsically controlled, facilitating the design of magnetic materials for applications such as flexible spintronics.</p>

            <p>We report the synthesis of single crystals of Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ through a two-stage chemical vapor transport method. The Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ system is a member of the orthorhombic $Pbam$ (No. 55) space group and realizes a distorted trigonal tricapped prism (TTP) crystal field around each cerium site. We characterized the sample through orientation-dependent magnetization and heat capacity measurements to probe the magnetic anisotropy in the system characteristic of XY-like anisotropic Heisenberg model behavior. Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ furthermore enters a zero-field ordered phase under $T_N =$ 2.4 K; powder neutron diffraction measurements reveal incommensurate magnetic order near $T_N$. The system then locks into a commensurate, two-$q$ magnetic structure below approximately 1.2 K. This commensurate structure belongs to the Shubnikov group $Pb'a'm'$ (MSG 55.359) and realizes the propagation vectors $\vec{q} = (1/3,0,0)$ and $\vec{q} = (0,0,0)$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jarosław Pawłowski, Marcin Dudziak, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang, Piotr Surówka</p>
            <p>Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fazil Najeeb, Arnab Pal, V.V. Prasad</p>
            <p>We study the diffusion process in the presence of stochastic resetting inside a two-dimensional wedge of top angle $\alpha$, bounded by two infinite absorbing edges. In the absence of resetting, the second moment of the first-passage time diverges for $\alpha>\pi/4$ while it remains finite for $\alpha<\pi/4$, resulting in an unbounded or bounded coefficient of variation in the respective angular regimes. Upon introducing stochastic resetting, we analyze the first-passage properties in both cases and identify the geometric configurations in which resetting consistently enhances the rate of absorption or escape through the boundaries. By deriving the expressions for the probability currents and conditional first-passage quantities such as splitting probabilities and conditional mean first-passage times, we demonstrate how resetting can be employed to bias the escape pathway through the favorable boundary. Our theoretical predictions are verified through Langevin-type numerical simulations, showing excellent agreement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linjuan Wang, Fan Feng</p>
            <p>We merge classical origami concepts with active actuation by designing origami patterns whose panels undergo prescribed metric changes. These metric changes render the system non-Euclidean, inducing non-zero Gaussian curvature at the vertices after actuation. Such patterns can be realized by programming piecewise constant director fields in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) sheets. In this work, we address the geometric design of both compatible reference director patterns and their corresponding actuated configurations. On the reference configuration, we systematically construct director patterns that satisfy metric compatibility across interfaces. We prove the existence and uniqueness of compatible director fields at a vertex for the generic case, up to orthogonal duals. The Gaussian curvature of the actuated vertex is computed based on the compatible director fields. On the actuated configuration, we develop a continuum mechanics framework to analyze the kinematics of non-Euclidean origami. In particular, we fully characterize the deformation spaces of three-fold and four-fold vertices and establish analytical relationships between their deformations and the director patterns. Building on these kinematic insights, we propose rational designs of large director patterns: one based on a quadrilateral tiling with alternating positive and negative actuated Gaussian curvature, and the other combining three-fold and four-fold vertices governed by a folding angle theorem. Remarkably, both designs achieve compatibility in both the reference and actuated states. We also propose a design strategy for active metamaterials based on the periodic non-Euclidean origami. The active metamaterials can have two modes of motions by folding or stimulating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srijan Chatterjee, Tarun Kanti Ghosh</p>
            <p>The non-linear transport of charge and spin due to the emergence of band geometric effects has garnered much interest in recent years. In this work, we show that a linear in-plane spin current vanishes, whereas a non-linear (second-order) in-plane spin current exists for a generic two-dimensional system having time-reversal symmetry. The intrinsic second-order spin current originates from the spin Berry curvature polarizability. The formulation when applied to 2D hole gases with the $k^3$ Rashba spin-orbit coupling reveals the existence of both transverse and longitudinal second-order spin currents normal to the spin orientation. Interestingly, anisotropic spin-orbit couplings can generate collinearly polarized spin current (spins polarized in the direction of spin current) in the second-order. The effects of anisotropy are explored by introducing an additional Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and electromagnetic radiation over the isotropic Rashba system. The generation and control over the multiple in-plane spin currents may have important applications in spintronic devices.</p>

We show that charge hopping mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.</p>

            <p>The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.</p>

The potential was then employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict key thermal properties such as melting point, thermal expansion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. To further assess model accuracy, we fabricated a UN sample and performed new thermal conductivity measurements representative of single-crystal properties, which showed strong agreement with the MLIP predictions.

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding operation of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by an exotic nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with or without the aid of a controlled defect. The topological zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagomé lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the kagomé lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.</p>

            <p>We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.</p>

            <p>The elusive X-Defect, a defect found in low-resistivity $p$-type Silicon after irradiation, observed as a low-temperature shoulder of the $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{O}_\mathrm{i}$ defect (Boron-interstitial-Oxygen-interstitial complex) in Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) measurements, was investigated to determine its properties, matching them with those of a previously identified defect. Through a combination of TSC, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Difference-DLTS (DDLTS), numerical simulations of field-enhanced charge carrier emissions in TSC measurements and a comparison to literature, the X-Defect was identified as the singly positively charged Silicon di-vacancy $\mathrm{V}_2(+/0)$. This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect. Assigning the X-Defect to an electrically neutral defect in the space charge region resolves previous contradictions regarding its deficiency in impacting on the effective doping concentration.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good lattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier material for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate spin-dependent transport in hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with physisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\Delta_1$-like symmetry around the $\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We revisit the irreversibility of the pendulum with time-dependent angular frequency, considered in a classical paper by K. Husimi. He introduced a parameter that measures the adiabaticity of a process utilizing an adiabatic invariant for the equation of motion of the pendulum. With this adiabaticity parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter. Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process, and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.</p>

            <p>We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ Homogeneous Electron Fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model -- a small, square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions -- are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 100$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Kubo</p>
            <p>This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the critical state in the ferromagnetic superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Robert Fern, Joseph Alec Wilcox, Tong Ren, Ivan Veshchunov, Tsuyoshi Tamegai, Simon John Bending</p>
            <p>There are very few materials in which ferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity due to the destructive effect of the magnetic exchange field on singlet Cooper pairs. The iron-based superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ is therefore unique in exhibiting robust superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K and long-range ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{FM}\approx19$ K. Here we report a spatially-resolved study of the irreversible magnetisation in this system that reveals a variety of novel behaviours that are strongly linked with underlying ferromagnetic domain structures. In the superconducting-only state, hysteretic magnetisation due to irreversible vortex motion is consistent with typical weak vortex-pinning behaviour. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$, very narrowly-spaced stripe domains give rise to highly erratic and irreproducible fluctuations in the irreversible magnetisation that we attribute to the dynamics of multi-vortex clusters stabilised by the formation of vortex polarons. In contrast, at lower temperatures, ferromagnetic domains become wider and saturated with spontaneously nucleated vortices and antivortices, leading to a smoother but unconventional evolution of the irreversible state. This observation suggests that the penetrating flux front is roughened by the presence of the magnetic domains in this regime, presenting a clear departure from standard critical state models. Our findings indicate that the mechanism governing irreversibility is strongly influenced by the precise nature of the underlying ferromagnetic domains, being very sensitive to the specific material parameters of EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. We consider the possible microscopic origins of these effects, and suggest further ways to explore novel vortex-domain magnetic behaviours.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering new avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) p-n heterojunctions are important building blocks for advanced electronics and optoelectronics, in which high-quality heterojunctions essentially determine device performances or functionalities. Creating tunable depletion regions with substantially suppressed leakage currents presents huge challenges, but is crucial for heterojunction applications. Here, by using band-aligned p-type SnSe and n-type ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 as a model, we report near-ideal multifunctional vdW p-n heterojunctions with small reverse leakage currents (0.1 pA) and a desired diode ideality factor (1.95). We realize ferroelectric-tuned band alignment with a giant barrier modulation of 900 meV. Based on such tunable heterojunctions, we propose and demonstrate a fundamental different memory device termed ferroelectric junction field-effect transistor memory, which shows large memory windows (1.8 V), ultrafast speed (100 ns), high operation temperature (393 K), and low cycle-to-cycle variation (2 %). Additionally, the reliable synaptic characteristics of these memory devices promise low-power neuromorphic computing. Our work provides a new device platform with switchable memory heterojunctions, applicable to high performance brain-inspired electronics and optoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juha Tiihonen, David Trejo-Garcia, Tapio T. Rantala, Marco Ornigotti</p>
            <p>We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. We present comprehensive details and method validation studies for our approach based on dipole imaginary-time autocorrelation functions. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we use the Drude model as the long-wavelength limit of the Lindhard response, presenting its analytical continuation into the imaginary time and Matsubara series. We demonstrate great agreement within $1\%$ between PIMC and the reference model, indicating negligible numerical biases and physical many-body effects in metallic densities. The approach is amenable to nonlinear optical response, quantum confinements, dispersion forces, and to inform applications such as plasmonics and epsilon-near-zero materials.</p>

            <h2>Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sankar Das Sarma, Jay D. Sau, Yi-Ting Tu, Shuyang Wang</p>
            <p>A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional s-wave superconductivity in regular 3D (or 2D) metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' SC that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being SC is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We discuss both 2D and 3D cases, focusing mostly on the 3D case. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K for s-wave SC in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $>10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the $T_c$ of the 3D (or 2D) electron gas can be reduced well below $\sim1$ K depending on choices of frequency cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered 60 years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-s-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.</p>

            <h2>Embedding independent length scale of flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seokju Lee, Seung Hun Lee, Bohm-Jung Yang</p>
            <p>In flat-band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat-band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding independent characterization of interacting flat-band materials.</p>

It is known to belong to a new long-range random universality class for certain values of the decay parameter $\sigma$. Exploiting the field-theoretic renormalization group approach within the minimal subtraction scheme, we compute the three-loop rermalization group functions. On their basis, with the help of asymptotic series resummation methods, we estimate the correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ characterising the new universality class for $d=3$ and for those values of $\sigma$ for which long-range interactions are relevant for the critical behaviour.</p>

            <h2>Simulated Annealing for Quadratic and Higher-Order Unconstrained Integer Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Suzuki</p>
            <p>Simulated annealing (SA) is a key algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which model numerous real-world systems. While SA is commonly used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, many practical problems are more naturally formulated using integer variables. We therefore study quadratic and higher-order unconstrained integer optimization (QUIO and HUIO) problems, which generalize QUBO by allowing integer-valued variables and higher-order interactions. Conventional approaches often convert these problems into QUBO formulations through binary encoding and the reduction of higher-order terms. Such conversions, however, greatly increase the number of variables and interactions, resulting in long computation times and, for large-scale problems, even making the conversion itself a dominant computational bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient framework that directly applies SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without converting them into QUBO. Within this framework, we introduce an optimal-transition Metropolis method, designed to improve efficiency when the variable range is wide, and evaluate its performance alongside the conventional Metropolis and heat bath methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed direct approach achieves higher efficiency and better solution quality than the conventional QUBO-based formulation and reveal the practical advantages of the optimal-transition Metropolis method. The algorithm developed in this study is available as part of the open-source library OpenJij, which provides a Python front end with a C++ backend.</p>

            <p>Large chemical tunability and strong light-matter interactions make colloidal transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanostructures particularly suitable for light-emitting applications. However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombination, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL.</p>

            <p>Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuncheng Mao, Claudio Attaccalite</p>
            <p>Magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and reshape a material's spatial symmetry. Because the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is exquisitely sensitive to symmetry, it offers a natural arena for magnetic-field control. Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response.</p>

            <p>As computational chemistry methods evolve, dynamic effects have been increasingly recognized to govern chemical reaction pathways in both organic and inorganic systems. Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics.</p>

            <p>Ultralow glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline materials is crucial for enhancing energy conversion efficiency in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators. We introduce a universal descriptor for thermal conductivity that relies only on the atomic number in the primitive cell and the sound velocity, enabling fast and scalable materials screening. Coupled with high-throughput workflows and universal machine learning potentials, we identify the candidate materials with ultralow thermal conductivity from over 25, 000 materials. We further validate this approach by experimentally confirming record-low thermal conductivity values of 0.15-0.16 W/m/K from 170 to 400 K in the halide metal CsAg2I3. Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity. Our work illustrates how a universal descriptor, combined with high-throughput screening, machine-learning potential and experiment, enables the efficient discovery of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</p>

Through empirical and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that with proper standardization, the learning dynamics converges to the behavior seen in the simple Gaussian case. This finding exhibits a form of universality, where diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, thereby strengthening the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</p>

            <p>We explore the potential of levitating solids embedded with non-permanent, optically controllable electron spins, which can be used to hyperpolarize their nuclear spin environment with exceptionally long lifetimes. For example, pentacene-doped naphthalene, which will also serve as our prime example, can achieve bulk polarization exceeding $80\,\%$ at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending over weeks. These materials make a compelling case for applications such as matter-wave interferometry and novel uses of established NMR techniques. In that spirit, we design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis in such materials, avoids many of the limitations associated with solid state crystals hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</p>

            <p>This is the third in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta>0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U<0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta>0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta \in (U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates, i.e., creates a critical droplet somewhere in $\Lambda_\beta$ that subsequently grows by absorbing particles from the surrounding gas. In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\theta\beta}$ with $\Delta < \theta < 2\Delta-U$. In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Theta < \Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales.</p>

This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanhua Wang, Jie Su, Jin Wang</p>
            <p>Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</p>

            <h2>Engineering micromotion in Floquet prethermalization via space-time symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilyoun Na, Jack Kemp, Sinéad M. Griffin, Yang Peng</p>
            <p>We present a systematic framework for Floquet prethermalization under strong resonant driving, emphasizing the pivotal role of dynamical space-time symmetries. Our approach demonstrates how dynamical space-time symmetries map onto the projective static symmetry group of the prethermal Hamiltonian governing the prethermal regime. We introduce techniques for detecting dynamical symmetries through the time evolution of local observables, facilitating a detailed analysis of micromotion within each period and surpassing the limitations of conventional stroboscopic Floquet prethermal dynamics. To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</p>

            <p>We consider initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and Guyer-Krumhansl constitutive equation. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method. To illustrate the final formulae, we consider a numerical example for a special case in which heat exchange at one of the boundaries obeys Newton's law.</p>

            <p>Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75~ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15~seconds at zero magnetic field between 50~mK and 1~K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</p>

            <h2>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl, Xiao-Qi Sun</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</p>

            <h2>Semi-classical geometric tensor in multiparameter quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoya Imai, Jing Yang, Luca Pezzè</p>
            <p>The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</p>

            <p>We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of Superradiant Peak Emission in Spatially Extended Emitter Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity exactly for many spatially separated emitters remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Based on third-order cumulant expansion methods, we present general scaling laws for the expononent of the peak emission rate as a function of the emitter number in free-space emitter arrays and arrays coupled to one-dimensional waveguide reservoirs. We find, that for 1D chains in free-space the peak emission rate scales linearly with $N$, while for 2D and 3D arrays with finite emitter spacing it scales superlinearly but sub-quadratically. For emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs we find that the peak emission rate scales quadratically with $N$.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Kullig, Jan Wiersig, Henning Schomerus</p>
            <p>The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</p>

            <p>Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved through improvements in electrical efficiency in devices containing V-defects. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to reduced barrier heights for charge injection in thinned, low-Indium quantum wells parallel to semi-polar V-defect facets. To test this proposition, a novel approach in which the tip of a scanning tunneling luminescence microscope as a local hole injector, is used to map the optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-defects with nanoscale spatial resolution. A 1 V reduction in the forward bias necessary for current injection at V-defect rims is observed. This, combined with the observation of small (~10 meV) blue shifts in the locally emitted electroluminescence, unambiguously confirms the charge injection mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Finocchiaro, Giovanni O. Luilli, Giuliano Benenti, Matteo G. A. Paris, Luca Razzoli</p>
            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <p>Digitally connected societies approach a \enquote{transparent} regime where all agents can interact without geographic or social barriers -- a limit realized by complete graph topologies. We solve exactly a $q$-state Potts model with many-body interactions on this geometry, modeling agents from $q$ distinct communities. Analyzing the illustrative case of competing pairwise and three-body couplings, we identify three key phases in the thermodynamic limit: democratic (all communities equal), marginalized ($q-1$ communities surviving), and consensus (one dominant group). For two-community systems, we identify a special coupling regime where interaction energies cancel, yielding purely entropy-driven dynamics -- a statistical physics representation of atomized societies without structured influence. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these phases and reveal metastable switching dynamics in finite systems. Furthermore, we establish an exact correspondence between this social model and mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin systems with quadratic and cubic Casimir interactions, revealing a \enquote{social-quantum} duality. This duality enables quantitative classification of social structures via Young diagrams and reinterprets quantum symmetry breaking as opinion stratification, bridging statistical sociology and quantum many-body physics.</p>

            <p>The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well in discovering isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.</p>

            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <p>Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</p>

We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</p>

            <p>To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Yamase, Luciano Zinni, Matías Bejas, Andrés Greco</p>
            <p>Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $\omega_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $\omega_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.</p>

            <h2>Photo-induced carrier dynamics in InSb probed with broadband THz spectroscopy based on BNA crystals</h2>

            <p>We report an optical pump - terahertz (THz) probe study of the photoinduced transient carrier dynamics in the low bandgap semiconductor Indium Antimonide (InSb). Using an organic N-benzyl-2-methyl-nitroaniline (BNA) crystal as a broadband THz source, we access the full spectral response over more than 5 THz, for varying pump-probe delay following the optical excitation. Using the Drude-Lorentz model accounting for differences between the excited length in material and the penetration depth of THz beam in pumped InSb, we extract the absolute carrier density as a function of the pump-probe delay, and provide insights on the diffusion length at given carrier densities, for different pump fluences. The mismatch between the THz penetration depth and the actual excited sample depth after carrier diffusion is discussed, since their evolutions with time and pump fluence are not intuitive as both quantities depend on carrier density.</p>

            <h2>Optical contrast-based determination of number of layers for two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neesha Yadav, Sandeep, Pintu Das</p>
            <p>Recent advances in revealing intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials have highlighted their potential for future spintronic applications, driven by their novel physical properties, promising for future spintronic devices. In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\,cm$^-1$ \& 190\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <p>Topological Kagome magnets, characterized by nontrivial electronic band structures featuring flat band, Dirac cone and van Hove singularities, provide a new avenue for the realization of thermoelectric devices. Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic and extrinsic photogalvanic effects in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Peñaranda, Hector Ochoa, Fernando de Juan</p>
            <p>The chiral lattice structure of twisted bilayer graphene with D6 symmetry allows for intrinsic photogalvanic effects only at off-normal incidence, while additional extrinsic effects are known to be induced by a substrate or a gate potential. In this work, we first compute the intrinsic effects and show they reverse sign at the magic angle, revealing a band inversion at the {\Gamma} point. We next consider different extrinsic effects, showing how they can be used to track the strengths of the substrate coupling or displacement field. We also show that the approximate particle-hole symmetry implies stringent constraints on the chemical potential dependence of all photocurrents. A detailed comparison of intrinsic vs. extrinsic photocurrents therefore reveals a wealth of information about the band structure and can also serve as a benchmark to constrain the symmetry breaking patterns of correlated states.</p>

            <p>To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.</p>

            <p>In this paper we present a theoretical examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a graphene monolayer integrated within an attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) configuration. By embedding graphene in this optical setup, we explore the enhancement in the nonlinear optical response, particularly focusing on the efficiency of SHG. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) plays a central role in significantly boosting the efficiency of SHG. The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying mechanisms that govern this process, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and the optical fields. Our findings suggest that the ATR scheme not only facilitates the excitation of SPPs but also optimizes the conditions for SHG.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of an exciton condensate and associated collective modes in a bilayer configuration of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$, an antiferromagnetic topological insulator and van der Waals material, recognized for hosting axion physics. Utilizing a minimal low-energy Hamiltonian for the two layer system which is gapped by the intrinsic Néel order, we first employ mean-field theory to establish the conditions for exciton condensation. Our analysis identifies a nonzero, spin-singlet exciton order parameter which is tuned by external displacement field, temperature, and Coulomb attraction. Beyond the mean-field, we explore collective mode fluctuations in the uncondensed phase via many-body perturbation theory and the random phase approximation. From this, we derive the exciton spectral function which allows for a direct comparison between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We detail how the softening of the collective mode peak is a function of the competition between interlayer detuning and thermal fluctuations. This work elucidates how the unique topological and magnetic environment of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$ offers a tunable platform for the realization and manipulation of exciton condensates and the corresponding collective excitations. Our findings contribute to understanding the interplay of topology and bosonic condensates, which could inspire application in optically accessing topological properties, dissipationless transport, and gate-tunable optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast quantum matter experiments have validated predictions from Floquet theory - notably, the dynamical modification of the electronic band structure and the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, via monotonic modulation of the driving amplitude. Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.</p>

In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quasiparticles that intertwine magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom underpin emerging strategies for manipulating and transducing quantum information in solids. A key missing element has been the ability to optically access dark excitons - optically forbidden but functionally crucial states that shape energy flow, coherence, and spin dynamics in quantum materials. Here we show that exciton-magnon coupling provides an optical gateway to dark excitons in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr. Broadband femtosecond reflectivity reveals a dark exciton at 1.46 eV that is entirely absent in static optical spectra but becomes visible through its coherent hybridization with a GHz magnon. High-photon-energy excitation further allows active control of the hybrid dispersion, enabling strong renormalization and selective enhancement of exciton-magnon interactions. These results establish a general mechanism by which magnetic order renders dark excitons optically addressable, opening a pathway toward engineered hybrid spin-exciton platforms for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.</p>

Results show that PSHE tuned by {\delta}n =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle {\Theta} because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of {\Theta} with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the {\Theta} is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |{\Theta}| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Real-Space Imaging of Moiré-Confined Excitons in Twisted Bilayer MoS$_2$</h2>

            <p>Twisted two-dimensional semiconductors generate a moiré landscape that confines excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) into programmable lattices, offering routes to efficient light sources, sensing, and room-temperature information processing. However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Planar Josephson junctions for sensors and electronics:Different geometry, new functionality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir M. Krasnov</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Tuning entanglement phases and topological memory in the measurement-only Kitaev model with single and multi-qubit checks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tushya Kalpada, Aayush Vijayvargia, Ezra Day-Roberts, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits provide an emerging controllable platform to realize novel dynamical non-equilibrium phases including topologically ordered states. The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote.</p>

            <h2>From quantum geometry to non-linear optics and gerbes: Recent advances in topological band theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomáš Bzdušek</p>
            <p>Topological principles constitute at present an integral component of condensed matter physics, permeating the modern characterization of electronic states while also guiding materials design. In this brief Perspective, I highlight three research threads in single-particle topological band theory that have recently gained momentum: (i) the rise of the quantum geometric tensor, whose components can at present be directly accessed with optical probes; (ii) the notions of delicate and multigap topology, which fall outside the scope of tenfold way and symmetry-based indicators yet leave robust physical fingerprints; and (iii) the consideration of bundle gerbes, which capture formerly overlooked higher-form topological aspects of energy bands. These distinct directions have been elegantly woven together: delicate and multigap topological insulators have peculiar features in quantum geometry that can be conveniently captured by bundle gerbes. This viewpoint exposes the recently identified quantization of a non-linear optical response and provides outlooks for its realization in crystalline solids.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Flow and Exceptional-Point Structure in Two-Mode Squeezed-Bath Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Bittner</p>
            <p>Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongchen Wang, Rafael Espinosa Castañeda, Jay R. Werber, Yao Fehlis, Edward Kim, Jason Hattrick-Simpers</p>
            <p>Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aashish K Gupta, Christopher Ness, Sina Haeri</p>
            <p>Evacuating the powder trapped inside the complex cavities of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures remains a major challenge in metal-powder-based additive manufacturing. The Discrete Element Method offers valuable insights into this evacuation process, enabling the design of effective de-powdering strategies. In this study, we simulate gravity-driven evacuation of trapped powders from inside unit cells of various TPMS structures. We systematically investigate the role of cohesive energy density in shaping the discharge profile. Overall, we conclude that the Schwarz-P and Gyroid topologies enable the most efficient powder evacuation, remaining resilient to cohesion-induced flow hindrance. Furthermore, for the two unit cells, we analyse detailed kinematics and interpret the results in relation to particle overlaps and contact force distributions.</p>

            <p>Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boris S. Maryshev, Lyudmila S. Klimenko</p>
            <p>This paper describes the problem of drift of solid non-interacting particles in a microchannel, which can stick to its walls under the action of the van der Waals forces and break away from the wall due to thermal noise and viscous stresses arising from the flow. The pressure drop is given between the channel inlet and outlet. At the initial moment of time, the channel walls are contaminated with adhered particles, i.e. the walls are uneven, which affects the formation of the flow structure through the channel. Over time, under the action of viscous stresses and thermal noise, the particles break away from the channel walls, causing its cleaning. The interaction of the detached particles with the flow is taken into account in the Stokes approximation. In addition, the model takes into account random particle motion caused by diffusion. The problem is solved numerically within the framework of the random walk model. The evolution of the liquid flow in the channel during its cleaning is obtained: stream function, pressure, and vorticity fields. The dependencies of the volume occupied by settled particles, the flow rate through the channel and the channel gap on time are determined for different values of the interaction force between particles and channel wall. The estimations of the channel cleaning time are obtained and discussed. The possibility of control the cleaning process by the modulation of liquid flux through the channel is investigated. It is shown that resonance phenomena can be observed. The dependencies of cleaning time on the modulation amplitude and frequency is obtained and studied. It is shown that changing the modulation parameters leads to a significant change in the cleaning time and helps control the cleaning process.</p>

Our analysis shows that neutral atom devices are already operating in a competitive regime, achieving comparable or superior performance to classical approaches while consuming significantly less energy. These results demonstrate the potential of analog neutral atom quantum computing for energy-efficient simulation and highlight a viable path toward sustainable computational strategies.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Control of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Two-Dimensional Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Application of a strong electric field to insulators induces a finite current. This phenomenon is called dielectric breakdown and is known as a fundamental nonequilibrium and nonlinear transport phenomenon in solids. Here, we study the dielectric breakdown of generic strongly correlated insulators in one dimension. Combining bosonization techniques with a quantum tunneling theory, we develop an effective field-theoretical description of dielectric breakdown using a non-Hermitian sine-Gordon theory. Then, we derive an analytic formula for the threshold field, which is a many-body generalization of the Landau-Zener formula. Importantly, we point out that the threshold field contains a previously overlooked factor originating from the charges of elementary excitations, which should be significant when a system has fractionalized excitations. We apply our results to integrable lattice models and confirm that our formula is valid in a broad range including the weak coupling regime, indicating its wide potential applicability. Our results unveil universal aspects of nonlinear and nonequilibrium transport phenomena in various strongly correlated insulators.</p>

            <p>We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Timsina, Boris Kiefer, Ludi Miao</p>
            <p>Magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials hold the potential for exploring new frontiers of physics that extend beyond Maxwell's equations. We have previously proposed a two-dimensional magnetic monopole gas (2DMG), confined at the interface between spin-ice ($R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho) and antiferromagnetic iridate ($R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho), which hosts monopoles with a net charge. The mechanism behind the 2D confinement of the monopole gas remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that entropy is a key factor in the 2D confinement of this monopole gas. We reveal that the competition between the entropy of spin-ice, which favors the 2D confinement, and the entropy of the monopoles' random walks, which favors the deconfinement, dictates the distribution of the monopoles within a few layers close to the interface. Our entropy-based model accurately reproduces the monopole distribution obtained from the spin model, affirming that 2D confinement is entropy-driven. We further employ both models to show that the monopole distribution can be manipulated by an external magnetic field and temperature, holding promise for next-generation devices based on magnetic monopoles. Our findings reveal the entropic mechanisms in 2DMG, enabling the manipulation of emergent quasiparticles at material interfaces.</p>

            <p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p>

This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case.</p>

We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kosuke Tazuke, Takahiro Morimoto, Sota Kitamura</p>
            <p>We establish a theoretical formulation of the orbital magnetic moment in multiorbital tight-binding models, focusing on the role of the electric dipole. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be decomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models generally. In particular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also contributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the conventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. The derived formulation for the magnetic moment is applied to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon where circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment. To account for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding system as a minimal model for studying the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these contributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an equal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our results reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger response compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the orbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight the essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.</p>

            <p>In this work, we systematically investigate the effect of Anti-site Disorder (ASD) on electrical resistivity $\rho(T)$ and transverse magnetoresistance $MR_{\perp}$ in off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si (CFTS) thin films across the thermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation (MPT). The CFTS films with A2 ASD exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (n-TCR) and an upturn below $\sim 30\,$K. In sharp contrast, the partially L2$_1$-ordered films are metallic in nature, characterized by a resistivity minimum at low temperatures ($T_{\min} \cong 30\,$K) and a positive TCR for $T > T_{\min}$. The change in the sign of TCR finds a straightforward explanation in terms of the competition between the quantum corrections (weak localization, electron--diffuson scattering) and the ballistic scattering mechanisms (electron--magnon and electron--phonon). We find that, stronger the atomic ASD, more prominent the quantum corrections and the weaker the scattering of $e-m$ and $e-p$ scattering. All the CFTS films exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and a significant drop in resistivity, symptomatic of a MPT, near the characteristic temperatures: martensite-end $T_{Me} \cong 300\,$K and austenite-begin $T_{\mathrm{Ab}} \cong 325\,$K. Regardless of the strength of ASD, in the martensite phase the anti-symmetric (ASMR) component of $\mathrm{MR}_{\perp}(H)$ dominates over the symmetric (SMR) counterpart, whereas the reverse is true (i.e. SMR $\gg$ ASMR) for the austenite phase at temperatures $T_{\mathrm{Ab}} \cong 325\,$K $\le T \le 375\,$K, where $\mathrm{MR}_{\perp}$ increases very sharply with temperature as the austenite phase grows rapidly at the expense of the martensite phase. The present results assert that the CFTS Heusler alloy thin films are promising candidates for shape-memory devices and for spintronic applications such as spin valves.</p>

            <h2>Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damien Barbier</p>
            <p>We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</p>

            <h2>Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihang Wang, Dirk Bouwmeester</p>
            <p>Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Flores-Calderón, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising Kondo-coupled vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</p>

            <h2>Spin-triplet pairing instability in a two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Can Liu, Yu-Feng Song, Yuan-Yao He, Tao Ying, Xueru Zhang</p>
            <p>The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model, from an unbiased numerical perspective.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daigo Oue, Mário G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elsa Danielsson, Henning Kirchberg, Janine Splettstoesser</p>
            <p>We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources, which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials, occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length. Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akanksha Chouhan, Abhishek Erram, Ashwin A. Tulapurkar</p>
            <p>Spin orbit torques (SOT) are used to manipulate magnetization of ferromagnets in heavy metal / ferromagnetic bilayers and thus are technologically relevant from magnetization switching perspective. This necessitates development of methods which give an insight into SOT behaviour and enable SOT efficiency estimation. In this article, we demonstrate an experimental approach of out-of-plane (OOP) angle resolved Second Harmonic Hall (SHH) measurement, in Pt/Co and Ta/CoFeB perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) systems, for damping-like and field-like SOT efficiency estimation. This method reveals a unique anomalous field-like torque dependent on magnetization direction in Ta/CoFeB system. The damping-like and field-like SOT efficiencies are extracted by solving LLGS equation in the low frequency limit of magnetic susceptibility. Along with SHH measurements, we also experimentally demonstrate anomalous Hall effect (AHE) based spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) technique for SOT efficiency quantification in PMA systems.</p>

            <p>The stabilization of macromolecules is fundamental to developing biological formulations, such as vaccines and protein therapeutics. In this study, we employ coarse grained polymer models to investigate the impact of four sugars: $\alpha$-glucose, $\beta$-fructose, trehalose, and sucrose on macromolecule stability. Free energy decomposition and preferential interaction analysis indicate that polymer-sugar interactions favor folding at low concentrations while driving unfolding at higher concentrations. In contrast, the polymer-solvent soft interaction entropy consistently favors unfolding across all sugar concentrations under study. At low sugar concentrations, polymer-solvent interactions predominantly govern stabilization, whereas at higher concentrations, entropic penalties dictate polymer stability. Local mixing entropy demonstrates that binary sugar mixtures introduce entropic contributions that preferentially stabilize the folded state. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of sugar-based excipient stabilization mechanisms, offering guidance for the rational design of stable biological formulations.</p>

            <p>We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length using a perturbative expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results introduce stealthy disorder into quantum tight-binding models and show that enforcing a low-$k$ spectral gap markedly alters the scattering landscape, enabling localization lengths that exceed the system size at fixed disorder strength. Since this mechanism relies only on the spectral properties of the disorder, it carries over directly to photonic and phononic wave systems.</p>

            <p>The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall conductivity.</p>

            <p>Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</p>

            <p>We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $\chi$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + \mu B'J' > 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.</p>

            <p>We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the Fermi level near van Hove singularity and the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.</p>

            <p>Janus derivatives of 2H MX2 (M = Mo/W; X = S/Se), namely MSSe, have already been experimentally realized and explored for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and optoelectronics. Focusing on the photocatalytic properties of these layers, we investigate the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on the MSSe layers in the presence of metalloid dopants B, Si, and Ge. The layers in their pristine form exhibit positive adsorption energies, indicating an endothermic nature. Substitution of a dopant in the pristine MSSe layers alters the local symmetry, bonding character, and charge distribution, thereby increasing the number of active sites for hosting H adsorption and reducing the adsorption energy. We select distinct sites, both atomic and interstitial, for the substitution of dopants. The energetics of the H atom at various sites is studied to find the most favorable active site on the MSSe Janus layers. Our results based on density functional theory calculations show that the adsorption process becomes spontaneous and less attractive in the presence of atomic site dopant substitution, whereas the interstitial site results in an endothermic behavior. Moreover, having the data from DFT, we develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the hydrogen adsorption energy. For this purpose, we utilize 23 elemental features of the atoms involved in the structure, thereby eliminating the need for DFT calculations in feature design. The dimensionality reduction technique, principal component analysis, is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, yielding independent features that are mutually orthogonal. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron regressor with two hidden layers. The data augmentation technique is employed to artificially expand the dataset size, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the neural network model by 0.90% on the testing data.</p>

Coupled with the FETMOD structure generator module, NEP-FET can simulate realistic field-effect transistor geometries at sub-micrometer scales containing millions of atoms, and delivers atomistic predictions of temperature fields, per-atom heat flux, and thermal stress in device structures with high fidelity. This framework enables rapid estimation of device-level metrics, including heat-flux density and effective thermal conductivity. Our results reveal pronounced differences in temperature distribution between fin-type and gate-all-around transistor architectures. The framework closes a key gap in multiscale device modeling by combining near-quantum-mechanical accuracy with device-scale throughput, providing a systematic route to explore heat transport and thermo-mechanical coupling in advanced transistors.</p>

            <p>Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a quantum circuit construction that combines classical random sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. Additionally, supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunhee Park, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</p>

Furthermore, velocity fluctuations are triggered by individual errors when following the aggregation rules. Notably, the system exhibits scale invariance, which is shown to be rooted in the model's definition -- a feature that we label as structural criticality. Finally, we show the emergence of a striking regime where spatial and orientational coherence decouple. That is, the system can achieve states of high and low polarization while maintaining spatial homogeneity.</p>

In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.</p>

            <h2>Functional renormalization with interaction flows: A single-boson exchange perspective and application to electron-phonon systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiman Al-Eryani, Marcel Gievers, Kilian Fraboulet</p>
            <p>The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Yamamoto, Hakuto Suzuki, Jun Miyawaki</p>
            <p>A two-dimensional resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (2D-RIXS) microscopy system has been developed at the beamline BL02U of NanoTerasu. The instrument combines a Wolter type-I mirror for spatial imaging with a varied-line-spacing grating spectrometer, simultaneously achieving micrometer-scale spatial resolution and ultrahigh energy resolution in the soft x-ray regime. Test chart measurements confirm a vertical spatial resolution of 1.0 um near the field-of-view center, and the horizontal resolution determined by the incident beam footprint is 0.8 um. RIXS imaging capabilities have been demonstrated by the measurements of a patterned NanoTerasu logo and exfoliated NiPS${}_3$ nanoflakes, highlighting its efficiency in locating specific microscale regions within inhomogeneous samples. These results establish 2D-RIXS microscopy as a position-sensitive probe of elementary excitations in quantum materials and functional devices.</p>

            <h2>Density functional theory for core-level X-ray absorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seokkyu An, Taisuke Ozaki</p>
            <p>We establish a rigorous density functional theory (DFT) framework for core-level X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) by formulating a constrained search for core-excited states based on the Gunnarsson-Lundqvist theorem. Within this framework, the explicit-core Delta SCF scheme enables shift-free absolute edge alignment and a consistent treatment of L/M edges with spin-orbit-resolved projectors. In addition, by exploiting dipole selection rules, we recast the evaluation of the dipole matrix elements, which otherwise requires many independent Slater determinant calculations, into a compact single determinant form. This reduces the computational scaling from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of electrons, without introducing additional approximations. Across representative C, B, O, and Li K-edge benchmarks in molecules and solids, the method reproduces line shapes, polarization anisotropies, and absolute onsets without empirical shifts, providing a robust and scalable route to quantitatively reliable XAS simulations within DFT.</p>

            <h2>Effective action approach to quantum and thermal effects: from one particle to Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Salasnich</p>
            <p>We present a detailed derivation of the quantum and quantum-thermal effective action for non-relativistic systems, starting from the single particle case and extending to the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) field theory for weakly interacting bosons. In the single-particle framework, we introduce the one-particle irreducible 1PI effective action formalism taking explicitly into account the choice of the initial quantum state, its saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuation approximation, and its finite temperature extension via Matsubara summation. This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nalinikanta Pradhan, Rina Kanamoto, M. Bhattacharya, Pankaj Kumar Mishra</p>
            <p>The Josephson diode, a non-reciprocal quantum element analogous to the familiar semiconductor p-n junction diode, has been realized in solid-state systems but remains unexplored in tunable atomtronic circuits. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate the realization of the Josephson diode effect in an atomtronic circuit consisting of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate and with optical barriers serving as Josephson junctions. Our implementation of this macroscopic non-reciprocal quantum phenomenon is based on realizing the required inversion symmetry breaking through asymmetric barrier placement and an asymmetric alternating current (AC) drive, enabling position- and drive-tunable diode effects with efficiencies up to 15% and 91%, respectively. While standard time-of-flight absorption imaging can readily observe these effects, we employ cavity optomechanics for in situ, real-time, and non-destructive measurements of the relevant condensate dynamics. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for nonreciprocal Josephson transport, opening avenues for diode-based neutral-atom technologies in future quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Li, Fangyang Zhan, Haijun Cao, Jingjing Cao, Huisheng Zhang, Sheng Meng</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering severs as a forceful technique for uncovering high Chern numbers of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states with feasible tunability in high-order topologically insulating plumbene, which is readily accessible for experimental investigations. Under the irradiation of righthanded circularly polarized light, we predict a three-stage topological phase transition in plumbene, whether it is in a free-standing form or grown on h-BN. Initially, a metallic state evolves into a K(K')-valley-based QAH state with a Chern number of -8, which then decreases to -6 after the valley gap closes. Finally, a band inversion occurs at the $\Gamma$ point, resulting in a multichannel QAH state with C = -3. The trigonal warping model accounts for both K(K')-valley-based and $\Gamma$-pointbased QAH states. Additionally, growing plumbene on a non-van-der-Waals substrate eliminates the K(K')-valley-based topology, leaving only the $\Gamma$-point-based QAH state with C = +3. Our findings propose the tunability of various high Chern numbers derived from high-order topological insulators, aiming to advance the next-generation dissipationless electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Collective interactions between localized electronic excitations and the crystal lattice are central to many emergent phenomena in materials, including ferroelectricity and quantum magnetism. Despite its importance, the scaling behavior of such cooperativity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the direct observation of Dicke-type cooperativity arising from the coupled phonons and non-degenerate crystal-field transitions (CFE), namely a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect1, in the rare-earth orthoferrite, ErFeO3. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we uncover strongly coupled spin, lattice, and orbital excitations. By varying the temperature, we identify the phonon-CFE coupling strength scales as sqrt(N), where N represents the effective ground-state population, which is a hallmark of Dicke cooperativity. Our findings verified the cooperative nature of the interaction between local Jahn-Teller ions and long-range phonons, offering a pathway for tailoring electronic and vibrational properties of materials through population control.</p>

            <p>Tunable control of polar landscape in ferroelectrics is crucial for exploring new functionalities in nanoelectronics and materials science. While ferroelectric epitaxial thin films have been studied as transferred membranes on flexible substrates, the degree of control over membrane curvature and local polarization remains limited, being tied to spontaneous fold patterns or uniaxial mechanical deformations. To address this challenge, we introduce a versatile, high-precision optical method for engineering the bending and associated polarization landscapes in ferroelectric membranes. Our approach, based on a photosensitive polymer-assisted patterning technique, enables the creation of on-demand bending strain patterns at the micrometer scale. We demonstrate deterministic 90° and 180° polarization rotations in a ferroelectric BaTiO3 membrane, driven by in-plane strain and flexoelectric effects associated with strain gradients respectively. Such a patterning method is compatible with any oxide membrane, providing a versatile platform for studying strain dependent domain architectures, designing custom ferroelectric landscapes, and investigating flexoelectric behavior with unprecedented control capabilities.</p>

            <p>In the present work, we investigate oxygen vacancies (V$_\mathrm{O}$) in Co$_3$O$_4$, both in the bulk phase and under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation, by combining theoretical and experimental techniques. Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies. This is further supported by the observation that higher O$_2$ pressures increase the conversion and that the catalyst remains stable and active over several cycles.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of a phonon bottleneck effect impacting the thermal depopulation of photoexcited shallow defects in high-resistivity silicon. Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon. These findings provide microscopic insight into carrier relaxation dynamics in silicon and highlight the significance of electron-phonon interactions in the ultrafast processes governing materials used in optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Bound states and its energies for systems with the quartic energy-momentum dispersion $E(p) \sim p^4$ and polynomial potentials are studied using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) semiclassical approximation and the Wentzel complex method taking into account higher order WKB corrections. The obtained energies are compared with numerical values found by applying the variational approach utilizing the universal Gaussian basis. It is found that the wave functions of the ground and higher-energy states for systems with quartic dispersion have nodes in the classically forbidden region. Thus, the well-known oscillation theorem for the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is not, in general, applicable for systems with quartic dispersion. Still it is observed that the oscillation theorem holds in the classically allowed region in all considered examples. The properties of bound state wave functions are compared with the solutions of the exactly solvable problem of a square well potential.</p>

            <p>Atomistic simulations are powerful tools for investigating tribological phenomena at a fundamental level; however, simulating a tribological system remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of frictional processes. Recently, we introduced a hybrid method, QM-GF, that enables an accurate description of both interfacial chemistry and phononic dissipation in semi-infinite bulks. In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds. We provide a physical interpretation of this velocity dependence based on the modulation of the frictional force by the sliding motion over the periodic potential energy surface of the interface. High velocities lead to force cancellation, while low velocities result in a net frictional force characterized by a distinctive sawtooth profile.</p>

            <p>We introduce a topologically distinct skyrmion, termed a spin-flux skyrmion, which shares the same real-space magnetization profile as a conventional skyrmion but differs fundamentally in its underlying topological structure. This distinction originates from the path traced by its rotation matrices within the doubly connected SO(3) group manifold, leading to a nontrivial spinor phase of $e^{i\pi}$ upon encircling the texture. Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $\sigma_z$ component with weak dipolar $\sigma_x, \sigma_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $\sigma_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response.</p>

            <p>We study the tiling of a two-dimensional region of the plane by $K$-cell one-dimensional tiles, or $K$-mers. Unlike previous studies, which typically allowed for one single value of $K$ or sometimes a small assortment of fixed values, here a tiling may concomitantly employ $K$-mers comprising any number $K$ of cells, provided a maximality constraint is satisfied. In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehedi Hasan, Khayrul Islam, Michael T. Kio, AKM Masud</p>
            <p>Carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer composites are widely engineered using surface coatings and chemical treatments to improve interfacial bonding and load transfer. It has been suggested in the nanocomposite literature that nanotube curvature, in conjunction with surface functionalization such as polydopamine (PDA) coating, could serve as an additional control knob for tuning interfacial bonding and energy dissipation in polymer-CNT systems. While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained. Here, we employ reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations to resolve how curvature and PDA functionalization jointly govern interfacial energy evolution in CNT-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites. Our investigation reveals that curvature and PDA functionalization jointly produce opposite regimes of interfacial energy flow: high-curvature CNTs generate dissipative, frictional interphases, whereas low-curvature CNTs confine energy in rigid, cohesive shells. This polarity inversion originates from a curvature-induced transition in PDA adsorption geometry that transforms the interphase from an energy-releasing to an energy-storing configuration. These results establish curvature as a fundamental design parameter for engineering polymer-nanotube interfaces, offering a predictive route to tune interfacial energy flow, mechanical resilience, and transport properties beyond the limits of conventional chemical functionalization.</p>

At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting.

We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.</p>

This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported.

            <p>Crystalline symmetry can be used to predict bulk and surface properties of topological phases. For non-interacting cases, symmetry-eigenvalue analysis of Bloch states at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone simplifies the calculation of topological quantities. However, when open boundaries are present, and only the point group part of the symmetry group remains, it is unclear how to utilize crystalline symmetries to diagnose band topology. In this work, we introduce topological crystalline markers to characterize bulk topology in $C_n$-symmetric ($n=2,3,4,6$) crystalline insulators and superconductors with and without translation symmetry. These markers are expressed using a crystalline symmetry operator and the ground state projector, and are defined locally in position space. First, we provide a general method to calculate topological markers in periodic systems with an arbitrary number of unit cells. This includes cases where momentum quantization does not span all necessary high-symmetry points for computing the topological quantities, which we address using twisted boundary conditions. Second, we map these markers to the Chern number, bulk polarization, and sector charge for two-dimensional $C_n$-symmetric insulators in symmetry classes A, AI, AII, and superconductors in class D. Finally, we show how to numerically calculate the markers in finite-size systems with translation-symmetry (and even rotation-symmetry) breaking defects, and how to diagnose the bulk topology from the marker. Our results demonstrate how to compute bulk topological crystalline invariants locally in position space, thereby providing broader scope to diagnosing bulk crystalline topology that works even in inhomogeneous systems where there is no global rotation symmetry.</p>

            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in flatband systems has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics. Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system, with a coexistence of Dirac bands and flat bands, for exploring superconductivity. However, the roles of flat bands and dispersive bands played in determining the superconductivity remain elusive. Here, we focus on the alternating twisted quadralayer graphene to reveal unconventional superconducting behaviors by systematically quantifying individual contributions for both the dispersive bands and the flat bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. By analyzing the Landau fan diagram at zero electric displacement fields, we disentangle Dirac bands and flat bands, revealing a Coulomb interaction-induced band broadening effect. We further quantify the electric-field-dependent evolution of the critical temperature and coherence length, and estimate the flat-band Fermi velocity and superfluid stiffness via critical current measurements. Our results demonstrate an electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions mediated by Dirac band hybridization, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional flatband superconductivity in moiré systems.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneity, Fluctuations, and Gap Filling in Overdoped Cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Antonio Sulangi, Willem Farmilo, Andreas Kreisel, Mainak Pal, W. A. Atkinson, P. J. Hirschfeld</p>
            <p>Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$, and the gap is found to fill instead of close with increasing temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Ya. Kezerashvili, Anastasia Spiridonova, Klaus Ziegler</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of Xenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), phosphorene, and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), which are separated by insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The study of thin films and 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe$_2$ offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and device to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic annihilation pathways of magnetic skyrmions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Copus, Ezio Iacocca</p>
            <p>The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion. However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions. More broadly, our approach will contribute to the development seamless multiscale model and optimization machine learning approaches for material discovery.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daigo Oue, Mário G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Bin Qiang, Tianyu Liu, Zi-Xuan Gao, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. This work provides a clearer and more unified understanding of the quantum-metric contributions to nonlinear transport. It also establishes a solid foundation for future theoretical developments and experimental explorations in this highly active and rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p>The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic. Periodic boundary conditions(PBC) are applied in XY plane and open boundary condition (OBC) is applied along Z-direction. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, when the total magnetisation vanishes keeping the nonzero sublattice magnetisations, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The larger systems show the growth of the height of the peak of the susceptibility near the critical temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Sufyan, Brahim Marfoua, J. Andreas Larsson, Erik van Loon, Rickard Armiento</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization, enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moiré flatbands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moiré flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Lowest Landau Level: Unlocking More Robust Fractional States Using Flat Chern Bands with Higher Vortexability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitong Zhang, Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaohan Wan, Daniel E. Parker, Shi-Zeng Lin, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moiré flat bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters.</p>

            <h2>Posterior corrections for systematic distortions in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Bortel, Peter Moeck</p>
            <p>Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope, feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole report on that study are freely available on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moru Song, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal flat bands with Chern number $C$ are commonly understood as color-entangled states constructed from $C$ copies of the lowest Landau level. In realistic moiré systems, however, the band geometry is generally non-ideal, and the mechanism that stabilizes such FCIs remains unclear. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene as a platform, we find two FCIs separated by a continuous transition driven by a geometric instability of the Bloch wave this http URL the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable, and the resulting fractional phase is naturally described by the Halperin-$(112)$ state. Above the transition, the system is geometrically unstable, entering a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of standard quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this unconventional phenomenon, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: in the geometrically unstable regime, interactions hybridize electronic states near the $K$ point and generate an emergent ideal color component that supports the FCI. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," directly visualizing the ideal subcomponent in the single-particle level. Together, these results establish mechanisms which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, substantially enlarging their viable parameter space and clarifying the role of quantum geometry in strongly correlated topological phases.</p>

            <p>Manganese-doped zinc sulfide nanocrystalline thin films were synthesized using a low-temperature chemical bath deposition and deposited on glass substrates for controlled durations using triethanolamine (TEA) as a complexing and capping agent. After deposition, the films were annealed at 200 degrees Celsius and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline cubic zinc blende ZnS with an average crystallite size of approximately 37 nm. Optical measurements revealed strong transparency in the visible region, blue-shifted absorption edges due to quantum confinement, and a band gap value of approximately 3.70 eV. Mn incorporation resulted in a slight red shift of the absorption edge, attributed to particle growth and sp-d exchange interactions. These results demonstrate that Mn doping modifies the optical response of ZnS while preserving its crystalline structure, suggesting its suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.</p>

            <p>We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes. We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</p>

            <p>Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</p>

            <h2>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p>

To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented. In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations. We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Gavassino</p>
            <p>Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</p>

            <h2>Boundary reflection matrices of massive $ϕ_{1,3}$-perturbed unitary minimal models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoltan Bajnok, Rafael I. Nepomechie, Paul A. Pearce</p>
            <p>We propose explicit expressions for the boundary reflection matrices of the ${\cal A}_m+(r,s)$ series of massive scattering theories, obtained by perturbing the ${\cal A}_m$ unitary minimal models with $(r,s)$ boundary conditions with both bulk and boundary $\phi_{1,3}$ operators. We identify the vacua that live on the boundary with the allowed edges of the $(r,s)$ conformal boundary conditions of the $A_m$ Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model. The boundary reflection matrices are then ``direct sums'' of certain pairs of $A_{m-1}$ Behrend-Pearce solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation and are consistent with the boundary bootstrap and the recently-introduced crossing, as well as the $Z_{2}$ (height-reversal), Kac table and non-invertible symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Computational complexity of Berry phase estimation in topological phases of matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryu Hayakawa, Kazuki Sakamoto, Chusei Kiumi</p>
            <p>The Berry phase is a fundamental quantity in the classification of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have $\textit{a priori}$ bound for ground state energy. Here, $\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption. These results advance the role of quantum computing in the study of topological phases of matter and provide a pathway for clarifying the connection between topological phases of matter and computational complexity.</p>

            <p>We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</p>

We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation.

Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ki-Seok Kim, Arpita Mitra, Debangshu Mukherjee, Seung-Jong Yoo</p>
            <p>We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saavanth Velury, Yuxuan Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a momentum-space based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework for simulating quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices. Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Liouvillian topology and non-reciprocal dynamics in open Floquet chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Koch, Yu-Min Hu, Jan Carl Budich</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Light-Induced Lattice Coherence and Emission Enhancement in PTM-Passivated CsSnI3 Perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Y. Adams, Bruce Barrios, Michael Ziegenfus, Hui Cai, Sayantani Ghosh</p>
            <p>Metal halide perovskites continue to lead in optoelectronic applications, but the toxicity of lead has driven efforts to identify environmentally benign alternatives. Cesium tin iodide is one such, with a direct bandgap and near-infrared emission, though its performance is limited by instability. We show that phthalimide (PTM) passivation during single crystal growth enhances optical output and ambient stability. Under continuous excitation, PTM-passivated microscale crystals show up to a nearly one order of magnitude increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, accompanied by reversible sharpening of a low-frequency Raman mode associated with Cs rattling. This reveals dynamic, light-induced lattice reordering that passivates trap states and enhances radiative recombination. Mechanical grinding yields nanocrystals with redshifted, narrowed PL, consistent with a relaxed polymorph and reduced inhomogeneous broadening. Despite increased surface area, PTM remains effective in preserving near-infrared emission in nanocrystals as well. Power-dependent PL reveals distinct carrier dynamics, where microcrystals show redshift due to bandgap renormalization, while nanocrystals show blueshift and elevated carrier temperatures (300 to 1900 K), consistent with hot-carrier recombination. Extended illumination reveals reversible optical changes, including PL modulation, reflecting dynamic light-matter interactions and evolving defect landscapes. These results identify PTM-passivated Cesium tin iodide as an ideal platform for probing morphology-dependent carrier relaxation and light-induced vibrational coherence in lead-free perovskites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuocheng Lu, Zhuang Qian, Zhichao Guo, Likun Shi, Shi Liu, Hua Wang, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>We present a unified microscopic theory of nonlinear photon-drag currents, formulated within a geometric-loop framework that provides both transparent quantum-geometric interpretation and numerical tractability. In this picture, the photon-drag shift current corresponds to the dipole moment of the geometric loop, while the photon-drag injection current arises from the same loop weighted by a band velocity difference. We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy. Remarkably, an in-plane wavevector only a few times larger than that of free-space photons already produces sizable photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG, comparable to photogalvanic responses in typical noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional materials. These currents are broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization. Our results establish a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and highlight moiré bilayers as promising platforms for large, highly tunable optoelectronic responses.</p>

In electronic systems, however, its counterpart has long been overlooked due to the absence of electron polarization. Here, using large-scale first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure of twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. We find spontaneous spin polarization and the emergence of hidden flat bands at the interface between atomic layers. Most notably, we discover an unconventional geometric phase analogous to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in optics. This electronic geometric phase exerts opposite effects on superconducting currents of opposite chirality, enabling twisted cuprates to act as a filter for chiral superconducting current-even if the ground state itself is non-chiral.</p>

            <p>Overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann architecture requires new computational paradigms capable of solving complex problems efficiently. Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures.</p>

            <p>An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{this https URL}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p>

            <p>We present a multiscale approach for modeling an intermediate-band solar cell based on a GaAs-GaAlAs quantum dot superlattice of cubic symmetry. Our framework combines high-accuracy theoretical calculations of the superlattice band structure and miniband-related absorption coefficient with experimentally determined interband absorption data. The quantum-mechanically derived absorption spectrum is incorporated into a drift-diffusion transport model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where key processes, including thermal and radiative recombination, are taken into account. This integrated methodology enables realistic modeling of device performance. Our results identify an optimal superlattice constant of 14 nm, yielding a maximum solar cell efficiency of 13.3 percent. Further increase in the superlattice constant enhances the miniband-related absorption peak but reduces the generation rate in the n-type region, resulting in a net efficiency decrease. The proposed approach, integrating theoretical, experimental, and computational components, provides a reliable framework for assessing solar cells based on quantum dot superlattices.</p>

            <p>Studying boundary excitations provides a powerful approach to probe correlations in topological phases. We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins.</p>

            <p>Electric control of magnetism at room temperature is crucial for developing next-generation, low-power spintronic devices. However, the intrinsic incompatibility between ferroelectricity and magnetism in crystal symmetry, along with the absence of strong magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms, continues to pose major challenges. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework for magnon manipulation based on ferroelectric polarization switching in two-dimensional multiferroics. Taking monolayer multiferroics $\mbox{Ti}_{2}\mbox{F}_{3}$ as an example, our calculations demonstrate that ferroelectric switching can significantly modulate spin exchanges, thereby enabling nonvolatile and reversible electric control of the magnons. More importantly, the ferroelectric polarization reversal leads to a sign change in the Berry curvature, ensuring effective control over the valley Hall and nonlinear Hall response of magnons. This study provides a new way for realizing low-power and electrically controllable magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingyue Yang, Shibo Fang, Zongmeng Yang, Pin Ho, Jing Lu, Yee Sin Ang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, characterized by zero net magnetization and symmetry-protected spin-split band structures, has recently emerged as a promising platform for spintronics. In altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), the suppression of tunneling in the antiparallel configuration relies on the mismatch between spin-polarized conduction channels in momentum space. However, ideal nonoverlapping spin-polarized Fermi surfaces are rarely found in bulk altermagnets. Motivated by the critical influence of Fermi surface geometry on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), we investigate three experimentally synthesized altermagnets -- bulk $\mathrm{V_2Te_2O}$, $\mathrm{RbV_2Te_2O}$, and $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$ -- to elucidate how flatband-driven Fermi surfaces minimize spin-channel overlap and boost AMTJ performance. Notably, $\mathrm{RbV_2Te_2O}$ and $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$ host flat altermagnetic Fermi sheets, which confine spin degeneracy to minimal arc-like or nodal-like regions. Such Fermi surface geometry drastically reduces spin overlap, resulting in an unprecedented intrinsic TMR well over $10^3\%$ in the $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$-based AMTJ. Incorporating an insulating barrier further enhances the TMR to $\sim10^5\%$, surpassing most conventional MTJs. These results not only establish $\mathrm{KV_2Se_2O}$ as a compelling candidate AMTJ material, but also highlight the critical role of flatband Fermi surface geometry in achieving high-performance altermagnetic-spintronic device technology.</p>

            <p>Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) rheometry is a well-established method for measuring the extensional rheology of low-viscosity liquids. However, clear guidelines on the capabilities and limitations of the technique are lacking. In the present work, we define operational limits for measuring a transient extensional viscosity directly from observation of the rate of filament thinning, as well as model-based bounds on calculating a viscosity $\eta$ and extensional relaxation time $\tau_E$ of a liquid using DoS. Dilute solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyacrylamide (PAM) are used to probe the lower limit of measurable $\tau_E$, demonstrating that values as low as 0.1 ms can be resolved, provided (a) the intrinsic Deborah number (based on the ratio of the relaxation time and the Rayleigh breakup time scale) is $De \geq \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ and (b) an instrumental constraint related to spatial and temporal resolution is satisfied. This instrumental constraint is quantified through a new metric we define as the \textit{filament capture rate}, a ``figure of merit'' (expressed in Hz) that can be used to quantify the number of data points within the elasto-capillary regime that are available for extraction of $\tau_E$. We also investigate the sensitivity to other experimental parameters including variations in nozzle radius and Bond number ($Bo$). Across the tested range ($0.2 < Bo < 0.7$), extensional relaxation times for the same fluid vary by less than $\pm16$ \%; however, experiments with low viscosity fluids at $Bo > 0.5$ exhibit damped gravitational oscillations that affect early-time dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative roadmap for reliable DoS rheometry and affirm its use for measuring sub-millisecond relaxation times in weakly elastic fluids.</p>

Controlling the quality of the superconductor-normal metal interface is of crucial importance to the understanding and engineering of the superconducting proximity effect.

Using the concept of via contact and dry transfer, we have constructed smooth, van der Waals-like contact between 3D superconducting NbN/Pd and graphene with low contact resistance of approximately 130 $\Omega \cdot \mu m$. Gate-tunable supercurrent, Fraunhofer pattern, and Andreev reflections are observed, the properties of which can be understood using an induced superconducting gap $\Delta$' in this planar contact geometry. We discuss potential mechanisms impacting the magnitude of $\Delta$' and suggest ways of further increasing the proximity coupling.

In this work, we investigate the role of a single complex impurity in one-, two-, and three-dimensional infinite tight-binding lattices. Our study reveals a series of counterintuitive phenomena, including regions where localization vanishes and re-emerges as the impurity strength varies. Next, we study the corresponding finite-sized lattices, which are highly relevant to experimental realizations in readily accessible photonic platforms, revealing a variety of exotic features, such as scale-free localized states, exceptional points, and peculiar cross-shaped localized eigenstates, whose profiles deviate from the conventional exponential localization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faheem Gul, Orest Pavlosiuk, Tetiana Romanova, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Piotr Wiśniewski</p>
            <p>We study the origin of large topological Hall effect in the single-crystalline EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, which orders antiferromagnetically at the Néel temperature $T_{\rm N}=7.4$ K. Measurements of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity disclose anomalies that evolve with temperature and magnetic field, closely tracking the magnetization process. Analysis of these data identifies three possible mechanisms responsible for the enhanced Berry curvature driving the observed topological Hall effect. Below and above $T_{\rm N}$, Weyl states are the main sources of large momentum-space Berry curvature, though their formation mechanisms differ in these two temperature ranges. Below $T_{\rm N}$, breaking of $C_{3}$ symmetry generates Dirac points that split into Weyl nodes in applied magnetic field, whereas above $T_{\rm N}$, strong spin fluctuations can induce Weyl states. The third contribution, which occurs below $T_{\rm N}$, arises from scalar spin chirality developing within antiferromagnetic domain walls, which generates a real-space Berry curvature.</p>

            <h2>A path to high temperature superconductivity via strong short range repulsion in spin polarized band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>We consider a two dimensional metal that is spin polarized and with strongly repulsive interaction. The interaction is short-ranged and controlled by a screening plane located a distance $d$ away. We consider the case where $d$ is less than the unit cell spacing $a$. We show that due to Pauli exclusion, a controlled expansion is possible despite the strong repulsion, and in many cases results in pairing. We demonstrate this for a tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion. We also treat a second model on the triangular lattice with Wannier orbitals with size comparable to $a$. In this case we find $f$-wave pairing with order unity pairing strength, potentially leading to high $T_c$.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himadri Halder</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</p>

            <h2>Catalytic Resonance Theory: Kinetics and Frequency Response of Light-Promoted Catalysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul J Dauenhauer</p>
            <p>The illumination of catalytic surfaces with a continuous or pulsed stream of photons dynamically modulates surface chemistry for faster rates, higher conversion, or product selectivity control. To establish fundamental principles of dynamic photon-modulated catalysis, the photocatalytic conversion of a generic surface reaction was simulated to understand the kinetic implications of an independent stream of photons promoting surface product desorption. Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux). The maximum photocatalytic rate occurred orders of magnitude above the Sabatier limit at the resonance frequency, identified as the photon arrival frequency that matched the surface reaction rate constant. Non-equilibrium photocatalytic conversion occurred when the rate of photon-promoted product desorption was comparable to the rate of thermal product desorption. Results indicated the general utility of photon-promoted catalysis, with negligible benefit for rate enhancement and quantum yield with photon source pulsing or chopping due to the inherent dynamic nature of photons from light sources.</p>

            <p>The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu</p>
            <p>The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</p>

            <p>The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Li, Yi Li, Kai-Ya Zhang, Qing Ai</p>
            <p>Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</p>

            <p>Driven by growing demand for clean energy, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as promising self-powered systems, yet achieving high charge density remains a critical challenge. In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management. This work establishes NF-LC-based TENGs as a new platform for high-performance self-powered energy harvesting, linking soft matter physics with applied energy technology.</p>

            <p>We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.</p>

            <p>Real ecosystems are characterized by sparse and asymmetric interactions, posing a major challenge to theoretical analysis. We introduce a new method to study the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs. By deriving local Fokker-Planck equations and employing a mean-field closure, we can efficiently compute stationary states for both symmetric and asymmetric interactions. We validate our approach by comparing the results with the direct integration of the dynamical equations and by reproducing known results and, for the first time, we map the phase diagram for sparse asymmetric networks. Our framework provides a versatile tool for exploring stability in realistic ecological communities and can be generalized to applications in different contexts, such as economics and evolutionary game theory.</p>

We discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal and illustrate its ability to probe a variety of phenomena, ranging from collective polar excitations to phase transitions and disorder-dominated physics in relaxor ferroelectrics. Our proposal paves the way for a novel table-top probe of polar and dielectric materials in a parameter regime complementary to existing tools and techniques.</p>

            <p>A deep learning-based computational method is proposed for soft matter dynamics -- the deep Onsager-Machlup method (DOMM). It combines the brute forces of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the fundamental physics principle -- Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP). In the DOMM, the trial solution to the dynamics is constructed by DNNs that allow us to explore a rich and complex set of admissible functions. It outperforms the Ritz-type variational method where one has to impose carefully-chosen trial functions. This capability endows the DOMM with the potential to solve rather complex problems in soft matter dynamics that involve multiple physics with multiple slow variables, multiple scales, and multiple dissipative processes. Actually, the DOMM can be regarded as an extension of the deep Ritz method (DRM) developed by E and Yu that uses DNNs to solve static problems in physics. In this work, as the first step, we focus on the validation of the DOMM as a useful computational method by using it to solve several typical soft matter dynamic problems: particle diffusion in dilute solutions, and two-phase dynamics with and without hydrodynamics. The predicted results agree very well with the analytical solution or numerical solution from traditional computational methods. These results show the accuracy and convergence of DOMM and justify it as an alternative computational method for solving soft matter dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge, Yutaro Sakamoto</p>
            <p>For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We reveal that the extended nonlinearity for nonequilibrium state is bounded from upper by the information about Renyi divergences for equilibrium states in between practical and linear systems, and temperature and work.</p>

            <p>Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The singularities prevalent in classical thermodynamics largely stem from the "postulate of equal a priori probabilities" neglecting the physical constraints imposed by computational complexity. This paper introduces Complexity Window Thermodynamics (CWT), a framework that characterizes the observer's "ignorance" via a finite complexity budget, thereby naturally smoothing out singular behaviors associated with phase transitions and negative temperatures within this window. We derive a generalized First Law of Thermodynamics driven by a complexity generation potential, which incorporates "information processing work," and demonstrate a universal action-time bound constraining the growth of complexity. CWT not only offers a unified perspective on critical phenomena in condensed matter and the black hole information problem but also suggests that the total generatable complexity of the universe is comparable in order of magnitude to its holographic entropy. Thus, it paves a new pathway for a resource-theoretic unification of thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</p>

            <p>High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \Delta k_B T_c \approx 5 - 6$, indicating a stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2. The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.</p>

            <p>Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -- yet preserving the same resolution -- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -- analytically -- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -- numerically -- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerardo Aquino, Mauro Bologna</p>
            <p>We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we shows, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.</p>

            <p>We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>The critical O(N) CFT: Methods and conformal data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson</p>
            <p>The critical $O(N)$ CFT in spacetime dimensions $2 < d < 4$ is one of the most important examples of a conformal field theory, with the Ising CFT at $N=1$, $2 \leq d < 4$, as a notable special case. Apart from numerous physical applications, it serves frequently as a concrete testing ground for new approaches and techniques based on conformal symmetry. In the perturbative limits - the $4-\varepsilon$ expansion, the large $N$ expansion and the $2+\tilde\epsilon$ expansion - a lot of conformal data have been computed over the years. In this report, we give an overview of the critical $O(N)$ CFT, including some methods to study it, and present a large collection of conformal data. The data, extracted from the literature and supplemented by many additional computations of order $\varepsilon$ anomalous dimensions, are made available through an ancillary data file.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Piccitto, Giuliano Chiriacò, Davide Rossini, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</p>

            <h2>High-temperature partition functions and classical simulatability of long-range quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Jan T. Schneider, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Pascual Solis, Alex Windey, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Andrea Legramandi, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Automorphism in Gauge Theories: Higher Symmetries and Transversal Non-Clifford Logical Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi</p>
            <p>Gauge theories are important descriptions for many physical phenomena and systems in quantum computation. Automorphism of gauge group naturally gives global symmetries of gauge theories. In this work we study such symmetries in gauge theories induced by automorphisms of the gauge group, when the gauge theories have nontrivial topological actions in different spacetime dimensions. We discover the automorphism symmetry can be extended, become a higher group symmetry, and/or become a non-invertible symmetry. We illustrate the discussion with various models in field theory and on the lattice. In particular, we use automorphism symmetry to construct new transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes. In particular, we show that 2+1d $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models can implement non-Clifford transversal logical gate in the 4th level $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford hierarchy for $N\geq 3$, extending the generalized Bravyi-König bound proposed in the companion paper [arXiv:2511.02900] for qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lewis J. Burke, Mark T. Greenaway, Joseph J. Betouras</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of van-Hove singularities (VHS) in a system's electronic band structure on the formation and properties of excitons and trions. We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications.</p>

            <p>Electrons bound to the surface of liquid helium are an emerging quantum computing platform, offering the potential for highly mobile spin qubits that can be manipulated using CMOS-fabricated devices. Here, as a step toward realizing this technology, we demonstrate selective two-dimensional shuttling of electrons across a helium film condensed on the surface of a CMOS control chip. The electrons are moved in packets containing, on average, several tens down to single electrons. We perform CCD-style electron shuttling in any of 128 transport microchannels, each of which links electron storage zones and sensing zones in the 2D plane. Shuttling sequences can be repeated at least 10$^9$ times with no detectable electron loss. The device serves as a prototype quantum information processing platform that is readily scalable to control large monolithically integrated arrays of single electron spins.</p>

            <p>Binary Bi-Pd/Pt systems have attracted a lot of interest because of their topologically non-trivial nature along with superconductivity. We report the structural and superconducting properties of high-quality single-crystalline BiPt using a comprehensive range of experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, muon spin rotation/relaxation ({\mu}SR), magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity. Our findings establish that BiPt is a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.2 K which exhibits pronounced anisotropic superconducting characteristics attributed to its hexagonal crystal structure. Magnetization and electronic transport studies reveal that BiPt lies within the dirty limit, while {\mu}SR and heat capacity data indicate conventional s-wave superconductivity that maintains time-reversal symmetry. This work provides valuable insights into the pairing symmetry and superconducting mechanism of topologically trivial BiPt, a sound comparison system for other Bi-based topologically nontrivial superconductors.</p>

The spin wave dispersion in flakes of different thicknesses shows the key role of dipolar interaction in the spin waves of vdW ferromagnets, and the non-reciprocity of spin wave in thick flakes is observed, which is attributed to the bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction after excluding the influence of dynamic dipolar interaction. The measured bulk DMI parameter D is 0.08 $\rm mJ/m^2$, which is double that of pure $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$. Our work shows that Co-doped $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$ is a promising platform for investigating propagating spin wave and topological spin textures at room temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Dalladay-Simpson, Eric Edmund, Huixin Hu, Mario Santoro, Federico Aiace Gorelli</p>
            <p>Low-frequency Raman peaks, below 250 cm-1, are observed in hydrogen between 2-174 GPa and 13-300 K. The origin of these features is attributed to reorientational transitions (DeltaJ = 0; Q0-branch), which shift from the Rayleigh line as anisotropic intermolecular interactions lift the mJ degeneracy. This family of excitations closely follows the behavior of the S0-branches, sharing their dependence on pressure, temperature, and ortho-H2 concentration. Above 65 K, spectra corrected by the Bose-Einstein population factor reveal a broad continuum arising from populated higher J-states and increased ortho-para disorder. Upon entering phase III, where molecular rotation is inhibited, this continuum is quenched, giving way to well-established optical phonons. Below 25 K, equilibrated samples demonstrate a fine structure from isolated and pair excitations from impurity ortho-H2 molecules in a parahydrogen lattice, the latter a sensitive probe to anisotropic intermolecular interactions relevant to the quantum modeling of solid H2.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional antiferromagnetism has long attracted significant interest in many areas of condensed matter physics, but only recently has experimental exploration become feasible due to the isolation of van der Waals antiferromagnetic monolayers. Probing the magnetic phase diagram of these monolayers remains however challenging because established experimental techniques often lack the required sensitivity. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Elucidating the High-Pressure Phases of MAPbBr3 Using a Machine Learning Force Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashid Rafeek V Valappil, Sayan Maity, Varadharajan Srinivasan</p>
            <p>High-pressure phases of the hybrid perovskite MAPbBr3 have been investigated in detail using a novel machine learning force field (MLFF). MLFF simulations successfully reproduce the sequence of pressure-induced phase transitions from the $\alpha$ ($Pm\bar{3}m$) to the $\beta$ ($Im\bar{3}$) and finally the $\gamma$ ($Pnma$/$Pmn2_1$) phase. In the $\alpha$ phase, the simulations confirm the triple-well character of the potential energy surface for octahedral tilting shedding light into the local dynamic distortions. In the $\beta$ phase, our simulations reveal MA sublattice doubling yielding both orientationally disordered and ordered MA ions mirroring experimental observation. This mixed-order phase results from locally frustrated host-guest couplings arising from the in-phase octahedral tilt system ($a^+a^+a^+$). In the high-pressure $\gamma$ phase, we confirm the formation of polar and anti-polar domains, with the latter have higher lifetimes and persist for over 50 ps at pressures above 1.5 GPa. By elucidating the behavior of various phases of MAPbBr3, this work provides a fundamental understanding of how host-guest interactions and octahedral tilting govern the material's properties. Further, the importance of time scales and length scales in characterizing these phases is emphasized.</p>

            <p>We report the collective magnetism of the metallic altermagnet CrSb. Magnetic susceptibility and polarized neutron diffraction measurements show that CrSb is a perfectly compensated Ising altermagnet below a Néel temperature of $T_N = 733(4)$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments reveal anisotropic and highly-dispersive antiferromagnetic spin waves with velocities of 61(2) km s$^{-1}$ and 58(2) km s$^{-1}$ along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. The observed magnon dispersions along high-symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone are well described by a minimal Heisenberg model up to third nearest neighbors of alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic character, $J_1 = 23(4)$ meV, $J_2 = -5.4(8)$ meV, $J_3 = 5.2(8)$ meV, and an Ising single-ion anisotropy term $D = 0.15(4)$ meV. We observe clear signatures of chiral spin splitting along the low-symmetry $\Gamma$-$L$ direction, characteristic of higher-order altermagnetic exchange interactions, the first such observation in a metallic altermagnet.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometry tensor, intrinsic geometric characteristics of electronic states, plays a crucial role in the various nontrivial electromagnetic phenomena in quantum materials. Here, we reveal that quantum geometry significantly modifies phonon dichroisms through electron-phonon interactions in solids that break time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries. Specifically, the circular phonon dichroism is primarily dominated by the heat magnetic moments, while the linear phonon dichroism depends on the heat Drude weight, a thermal analog of band Drude weight. Furthermore, we establish the f-sum rule for the heat magnetic moment that facilitates its experimental detections. We demonstrate our key findings in an archetypal model system: ferromagnetic two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our work uncovers the quantum-geometric origin of common phonon dichroisms and predicts the detectable signature of the heat magnetic moment of electrons in solids.</p>

Using interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM), we directly image their nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution and control vortex number and position. Quantum-path analysis of coherent two-photon photoemission (2PP) processes reveals the nonlinear plasmonic polarization fields and angular-momentum conservation, establishing STPVs as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Precise and ultrafast control of electronic band structures is a central challenge for advancing quantum functional materials and devices. Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($\mu$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $\mu$eV accuracy. This framework paves the way for ultrafast on-demand band-structure engineering, pointing toward new frontiers in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement in molecular and biological systems, and attosecond control of matter.</p>

            <p>Controlled fabrication of twisted van der Waals heterostructures is essential to unlock the full potential of moire materials. However, achieving reproducibility remains a major challenge, particularly for air-sensitive materials such as $Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), where it is crucial to preserve the intrinsic and delicate superconducting properties of the interface throughout the entire fabrication process. Here, we present a dry, inert and cryogenic assembly method that combines silicon nitride nanomembranes (NMBs) with pre-patterned electrodes and the cryogenic stacking technique (CST) to fabricate high-quality twisted BSCCO Josephson junctions (JJs). This protocol prevents thermal and chemical degradation during both interface formation and electrical contact integration. We also find that asymmetric membrane designs, such as a double cantilever, effectively suppress vibration-induced disorder due to wire bonding, resulting in sharp and hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. The junctions exhibit a twist-angle-dependent Josephson coupling with magnitudes comparable to the highest-performing devices reported to date, but achieved through a straightforward and versatile contact method, offering a scalable and adaptable platform for future applications. These findings highlight the importance of both interface and contact engineering in addressing reproducibility in superconducting van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

Here, we integrate operando synchrotron X-ray fluorescence and diffraction with high resolution cryogenic electron and ion multi model microscopy to provide a mechanistic understanding of Pt based alloying anodes across length scales. We directly observe the initial lithiation driven formation of Li2Pt and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase during extended cycling via a solid solution type reaction mechanism. Simultaneously, the solid electrolyte interphase transitions from an unstable carbonate rich to a stable LiF dominated composition, confirmed by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography reveals spatially distinct compositional regimes within the alloy anode, including lithium flux limited, heterogeneous interfacial zone and a diffusion controlled, homogeneous LiPt alloy bulk. This nanoscale compositional gradient rationalises the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism and highlights how kinetic limitations and interface dynamics govern alloy formation and electrochemical stability. Our findings demonstrate a broadly applicable correlative framework bridging operando structural dynamics with near atomic resolution interfacial chemistry, advancing the rational design of durable alloy electrodes for next generation energy storage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sathish Kumar Paramasivam, Andrea Perali, Milorad V. Milošević</p>
            <p>We reveal the key role of the $d$-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap in strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors in determining the properties of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, associated with a sizable enhancement of the phase stiffness compared to nodeless-gap superconductors. The enhanced stiffness originates from extended regions of vanishing gap around the nodal lines of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Our study, based on mean-field and BKT theory, presents a comparative analysis of $s$-wave and $d$-wave scenarios, highlighting the features of the latter that boost the stiffness and the BKT transition temperature (T$_{BKT}$). The comparison focuses on two quantities: the mean-field critical temperature and the maximum superconducting gap related to the pairing strengths. We present a phase diagram showing the scaling of T$_{BKT}$ with respect to the mean-field critical temperature across the BCS-BEC crossover and the evolution of the pseudogap. We also present a zero-temperature phase-stiffness intensity map over the Brillouin zone, displaying a two-component structure consisting of low- and high-stiffness regions whose extent depends on microscopic parameters. These results identify the nodal gap structure of strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors as a key mechanism enabling enhanced stiffness and elevated T$_{BKT}$ compared to their $s$-wave counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Sunko, J. Orenstein</p>
            <p>Altermagnets are a class of collinear magnets that exhibit non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands in the absence of net magnetization. Their potential to generate large spin polarization without spin-orbit coupling has created strong interest in probes that access the underlying order parameter directly. In this Perspective, we show that linear magneto-birefringence (LMB) provides a natural and broadly applicable route to detecting altermagnetic order. Building on the correspondence between the momentum-space structure of NRSS and the ferroic ordering of magnetic multipoles in real space, we demonstrate how $d$-wave and $g$-wave NRSS textures yield distinct LMB responses. We present a symmetry-based framework that identifies the optical geometries and field configurations required to isolate specific multipole components, enabling domain imaging and providing benchmarks for theoretical models of LMB.</p>

            <p>The theory of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, a key probe of quantum geometry, is plagued by conflicting expressions for the conductivity that is independent of the dissipation strength (rate, $\Gamma^0$). We clarify the origin of this ambiguity by demonstrating that the "intrinsic" response is not universal, but is inextricably linked to the dissipation mechanism that establishes the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We establish a benchmark by solving the exact NESS density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath. Our exact $\Gamma^0$ conductivity decomposes into two parts: (i) a geometric contribution, $\sigma^{\text{geo}}$, whose form recovers the intraband quantum metric dipole ($\sim\partial_k g$), providing an exact derivation that clarifies inconsistencies in the literature, and (ii) a novel, purely kinetic contribution, $\sigma^{\text{kin}} \propto v^3 f^{(4)}_0$, which is absent when dissipation is modeled by white-noise disorder (e.g., a constant-$\Gamma$ Green's function model). The discrepancy in $\sigma^{\text{kin}}$ between these distinct physical mechanisms is a proof that the $\Gamma^0$ nonlinear conductivity is not a unique property of the Bloch Hamiltonian, but is contingent on the physical system-bath coupling.</p>

            <h2>Order-by-disorder from Schwinger bosons in a frustrated honeycomb ferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaud Ralko, Jaime Merino</p>
            <p>The cobalt-based honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) has recently emerged as a promising platform for studying frustrated magnetism beyond conventional paradigms. Neutron-scattering experiments and first-principles calculations have revealed an unexpected double-zigzag (dZZ) magnetically ordered ground state, whose microscopic origin remains under active debate. Here, we investigate the emergence of such dZZ phase in a ferro-antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, using a generalized Schwinger boson mean-field theory ($g$-SBMFT) that treats ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on equal footing. Based on $g$-SBMFT and exact-diagonalization (ED) techniques, we find that the dZZ is selected by an order-by-disorder mechanism in a narrow $J_3/|J_1|$ range, in agreement with recent density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. The magnetic excitation spectra within the dZZ phase displays a distinctive smearing out in momentum space due to quantum fluctuations which may be probed through inelastic neutron-scattering experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simin Pang, Zhengyi Li, Ziyu Wang, Yanpei Lv, Feilong Song, Peng Yan, Jun Zhang</p>
            <p>Magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) solitons hold great promise for magnonic information processing, but their existence has long been debated. In this work, we resolve this issue by advanced time-resolved Brillouin light scattering (TR-BLS) spectroscopy. We observe long-period MSSW soliton trains in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films by demonstrating their quasiparticle behavior, mode beating, and periodic modulations. We reveal that the MSSW soliton originates from the dipole gap mechanism with a unique comb-like frequency spectrum caused by the four-magnon process. By varying the microwave power, we find significant changes in soliton periods linked to the spin wave dispersion renormalization. Additionally, we report exotic transverse solitons across the YIG thickness. These findings deepen the understanding of nonlinear physics, and pave the way for spin-wave-soliton-based information technologies.</p>

            <h2>Height distribution of elastic interfaces in quenched random media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tuuli Sillanpää, Sanni Nousiainen, Lasse Laurson</p>
            <p>Elastic interfaces in quenched random media driven by external forces exhibit a continuous depinning phase transition between pinned and moving phases at a critical external force. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 175701 (2022)] has shown that the distribution of local interface heights at depinning displays negative skewness. Here, by considering local, long-range and fully-coupled (mean-field) elasticity, we expand on this result by demonstrating the robustness of the negative skewness at depinning when approaching the thermodynamic limit and considering different values of the spring stiffness controlling the avalanche cutoff. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of the height distribution as the external force is ramped up from zero, approaching the critical force from below. Starting from a symmetric height distribution at zero force, the distribution initially develops positive skewness increasing with the external force, followed by a steep drop to the negative value characteristic of the critical point as the depinning transition is reached.</p>

            <p>This work reports the discovery of high plasticity in ternary germanium-based single-crystal GaGeTe, which breaks through the inherent brittleness of traditional binary germanium-based chalcogenides and fills a research gap in germanium-based plastic semiconductors. Combining spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy experiments with density functional theory calculations, the study reveals a novel deformation mechanism co-dominated by intralayer lattice distortion and interlayer slip. These findings provide fresh insight into the plastic behavior of inorganic semiconductors and clarifies the critical role of intralayer structural evolution in plastic behavior. This work not only expands the family of plastic semiconductor materials but also provides a new theoretical basis and candidate platform for the material design of flexible electronic devices.</p>

            <p>We explore the non-reciprocal intracell hopping mediated non-Hermitian topological phases of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting second-nearest-neighbour hopping. We microscopically analyze the phase boundaries using the non-Bloch momentum while the off-critical (critical) phases are directly associated with the gapped (gapless) nature of the non-Bloch bands that we derive from the characteristic equation using the gauge freedom. The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. We examine the adiabatic dynamics to promote the concept of adiabatic charge transport in a non-Hermitian scenario justifying the BBC in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number. Once the non-Bloch bands experience no (a) gap-closing during the evolution of time, quantized flow of is preserved (broken). Our study systematically unifies the concept of non-Bloch bands for both static and driven situations.</p>

            <p>The work analyzes the effect of a magnetic field $B$ directed along the $c$ axis ($B \parallel c$) up to 9~T on the resistivity $\rho(T)$, fluctuation conductivity (FLC) $\sigma'(T)$ and pseudogap $\Delta^*(T)$ in thin films of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a critical temperature of the superconducting transition $T_c = 88.8$~K. In contrast to previous work, where the magnetic field was directed along the $ab$ plane ($B \parallel ab$), the influence of the field on the sample is stronger due to the contribution of both spin--orbit and Zeeman effects. It was found that the BEC--BCS transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{pair}}$, which corresponds to the maximum of the $\Delta^*(T)$ dependence, shifts to the region of lower temperatures with increasing $B$, and the maximum value of $\Delta^*(T_{\mathrm{pair}})$ decreases in fields $B > 5$~T. It was found that with increasing field, the low-temperature maximum near $T_0$ is smeared and disappears at $B > 1$~T. In addition, above the Ginzburg temperature $T_G$, for $B > 1$~T, a minimum appears on $\Delta^*(T)$ at $T_{\min}$, which becomes very pronounced with a subsequent increase in $B$. As a result, the overall value of $\Delta^*(T_G)$ decreases noticeably, most likely due to the pair-breaking effect. At the same time, $\Delta T_{\mathrm{fl}}$ and $\xi_c(0)$ increase sharply by approximately 3 times with increasing $B$ above 1~T. Our results confirm the possibility of the formation of a vortex state in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ by a magnetic field and its evolution with increasing $B$.</p>

            <h2>$c=-2$ conformal field theory in quadratic band touching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Masaoka</p>
            <p>Quadratic band touching in fermionic systems defines a universality class distinct from that of linear Dirac points, yet its characterization as a quantum critical point remains incomplete. In this work, I show that a $(d+1)$-dimensional free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, and that its equal-time ground-state correlation functions are exactly captured by the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases. Moreover, the action of a $2\pi$ rotation on these excitations is represented by a Jordan block, reflecting the logarithmic character of the associated conformal field theory.</p>

            <h2>Comment on: "Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions"</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Sirker</p>
            <p>In Ref. Ansari et al., dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) -- non-analyticities in the Loschmidt return rate at critical times -- are investigated in the presence of noise for a two-band model. The authors report that DQPTs persist even after averaging over the noise and they use their results to derive dynamical phase diagrams. In this comment we rigorously prove that in any two-dimensional Hilbert space the Loschmidt echo of two density matrices can only become zero if and only if both density matrices are pure. As a consequence, the existence of DQPTs in the considered scenario is strictly ruled out for non-zero noise because the considered averaging leads to a mixed state. We also investigate alternative natural ways to average over noise realizations and show that in all of them DQPTs are smoothed out.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors at the thermal first-order transitions of three-dimensional q-state Potts models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We study the out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like dynamics of three-dimensional $q$-state Potts systems driven across their thermal first-order transition in the thermodynamic limit, by a relaxational (heat-bath) dynamics. During the evolution, the inverse temperature $\beta$ increases linearly with time, as $\delta\beta(t)\equiv \beta(t)- \beta_{\rm fo} \sim t/t_s$, where $\beta_{\rm fo}$ is the inverse temperature at the transition point, $t$ is the time and $t_s$ is a time scale. The dynamics starts at $t_i< 0$ from an ensemble of disordered configurations equilibrated at inverse temperature $\beta(t_i)<\beta_{\rm fo}$ and ends at positive values of $t$, when the system is ordered (this is analogous to a standard Kibble-Zurek protocol). The time-dependent energy density shows an out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit, in terms of the scaling variable $t(\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$. The corresponding exponent turns out to be consistent with $\kappa=3/2$ (with a good accuracy), which is the value obtained by assuming that the initial nucleation of ordered regions provides the relevant mechanism for the passage from one phase to the other. The scaling behavior implies a spinodal-like phenomenon close to the transition point: the passage from the disordered to the ordered phase, composed of large ordered regions of different color, occurs at $\delta\beta(t)=\delta\beta_*>0$, where $\delta\beta_*$ decreases as $1/(\ln t_s)^{3/2}$ in the large-$t_s$ limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Majumder, Paul Ben Ishai, Gilad Orr</p>
            <p>Bismuth ferrite ($BiFeO_3$, BFO) is a promising multiferroic oxide whose practical utilisation is limited by secondary-phase formation and defect-driven electrical inhomogeneity within the $Bi_2O_3$-$Fe_2O_3$ system. In this work, BFO was synthesised via solid-state reaction using 55:45 and 70:30 (mol%) of $Bi_2O_3$ $\colon$ $Fe_2O_3$ precursors sintered between 700$^O$C and 800$^\circ$C, and characterised through X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and impedance spectroscopy. A refined phase diagram identifies the onset of liquid-phase formation near 835$^O$C, delineating a narrow thermal window for phase-pure BFO. The 55:45 composition evolves toward rhombohedral $R3c$ symmetry with lattice contraction, suppression of Sillenite- and Mullite-type impurities, and markedly reduced vibrational disorder, yielding homogeneous grains with near-Debye dielectric relaxation ($n > 0.9$), low CPE prefactors, and a four-orders-of-magnitude increase in bulk AC conductivity upon sintering at 775$^\circ$C. In contrast, the Bi-rich 70:30 samples retain expanded lattice volumes, defective grain boundaries, and highly depressed Nyquist arcs ($n < 0.5$), reflecting persistent structural disorder and stabilisation of insulating secondary phases. The convergence of structural, microstructural, and impedance signatures identifies the 55:45 precursor sintered at 775$^\circ$C as the optimal condition within the studied range, establishing a clear structure-property relationship that enables controlled synthesis and reliable dielectric performance in BFO-based multiferroic applications.</p>

This allows us to correlate the spatial profile of the moiré superlattice with the distribution of optically active states accessible to interlayer excitons. In heterostructures where a few degrees twist angle is imposed between the MoSe and WSe crystallographic axes, we show that a continuous moiré lattice is realized across areas close to the optical diffraction limit. In such regions, the photoluminescence reduces to a few narrow-band lines only, energetically distributed consistently with the geometry of the moiré lattice. This correlation reveals that interlayer excitons explore a controlled periodic confinement, paving the way towards implementations of Bose-Hubbard models.</p>

Together with the dataset, we present a suite of performance tests that range from conventional numerical error metrics to physically motivated evaluation tasks. With a focus on graph-based MLIP architectures, we run numerical experiments that assess (i) the effect of hyperparameters and (ii) the fine-tuning behavior of selected pre-trained ("foundational") MLIP models. Beyond the Li-P-S solid-state electrolytes, we expect that such benchmarks and their code implementations can be readily adapted to other material systems.</p>

            <p>We study the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with both onsite Hubbard interaction and the intersite density-density interaction between nearest-neighbors using the standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) on the Bethe lattice. We found that, at the ground state, the system can be in a charge-ordered insulating (COI), a charge-order metallic (COM) or a non-charge-ordered (NO) state. Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution.</p>

            <p>Artificially engineered twisted van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have unlocked new pathways for exploring emergent quantum phenomena and strongly correlated electronic states. Many of these phenomena are highly sensitive to the twist angle, which can be deliberately tuned to tailor the interlayer interactions. This makes the twist angle a critical tunable parameter, emphasizing the need for precise control and accurate characterization during device fabrication. In particular, twisted cuprate heterostructures based on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x have demonstrated angle-dependent superconducting properties, positioning the twist angle as a key tunable parameter. However, the twisted interface is highly unstable under ambient conditions and vulnerable to damage from conventional characterization tools such as electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques. In this work, we introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for determining twist angles in artificially stacked BSCCO heterostructures. By analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly utilizing the out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode of Bi/Sr at 116 cm-1, we identify clear optical fingerprints of the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers. Our high-resolution confocal Raman setup, equipped with polarization control and RayShield filtering down to 10 cm-1, allows for reliable and reproducible measurements without compromising the material's structural integrity.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian operator size distribution in charge-conserving many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mina Tarakemeh, Shenglong Xu</p>
            <p>We show that operator dynamics in U(1) symmetric systems are constrained by two independent conserved charges and construct a non-Abelian operator size basis that respects both, enabling a symmetry-resolved characterization of operator growth. The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run Hou, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</p>
            <p>The observation of fraction quantum Hall states in twisted MoTe2 has sparked a lof of interest in this phenomenon. Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of {\nu} = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at {\nu} = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For {\nu} = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor.</p>

            <p>Metal-semiconductor interfaces play a central role in micro and nano-electronic devices as heat dissipation or temperature drop across these interfaces can significantly affect device performance. Prediction of accurate thermal boundary resistance (TBR) across these interfaces, considering realistic structures and their correlation with underlying thermal transport, remains challenging. In this work we develop a unified Neuroevolution Potential (NEP) for the Si-Ti system that accurately reproduces energies, forces, and phonon properties of bulk Si, Ti, and TiSi2 and extends naturally to interfacial environments to analyze interfacial transport. An important development over current machine-learned interatomic potentials is the capability to model complex structures at metal-semiconductor interfaces, as the NEP enables large scale non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of epitaxial Si/Ti interfaces to elucidate the effect of amorphous or crystalline silicide interfacial layers. Simulated TBRs show excellent agreement with our time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements. Spectral analyses reveal that amorphous TiSi2 interfacial layer helps in efficient interfacial transport when the thickness is less than 1.5 nm compared to the crystalline TiSi2 layer, but this trend reverses when the interfacial layer thickness increases beyond 1.5 nm. Comparison of TBRs at Si/TiSi2 interface for different crystalline phases of TiSi2 establishes that C54 phase has reduced TBR compared to C49 phase, which is correlated with the difference in their phonon density of states (PDOS) overlap with Si. These results provide atomistic insight into the role of crystalline versus amorphous silicides in interfacial heat transport and demonstrate a transferable machine-learned potential for studying heat dissipation in advanced semiconductor devices.</p>

            <h2>Strained hyperbolic Dirac fermions: Zero modes, flat bands, and competing orders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher A. Leong, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Starting from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on {10,3} and {14,3} hyperbolic lattices that, for a uniform hopping amplitude, gives rise to emergent Dirac fermions on a curved space with a constant negative curvature, displaying a vanishing density of states, we propose spatially modulated hopping pattern therein that preserve the underlying 5- and 7-fold rotational symmetries, respectively, and effectively couples fermions to time-reversal symmetric axial magnetic fields. Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.</p>

            <p>Supplying spare parts from Earth for in space repair is economically prohibitive and logistically slow, posing a major barrier to sustainable space operations. As lunar and Martian missions accelerate in the coming decades, the feasibility of in-situ repair methods, particularly laser based welding, must be rigorously evaluated. The micro scale physics governing weld quality are fundamentally altered by variations in gravity and ambient pressure, yet their coupled influence across different welding regimes remains poorly understood. This work introduces a fully open-source thermo-fluid-microstructure modeling framework with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cellular automata (CA) to quantify how gravitational conditions reshape weld pool behavior across multiple welding regimes and spatial scales. The framework further enables prediction of the resulting microstructure from imposed process parameters, providing an accessible pathway for future research in in space manufacturing (ISM). As a demonstration, the article analyzes laser welding of Al6061 across three process regimes (conduction, transition, and keyhole) and four gravitational environments (Earth, Moon, Mars, and International Space Station (ISS)). Analysis reveals that reduced gravity suppresses buoyancy-driven convection, thereby altering melt pool geometries. Vacuum conditions increase laser energy deposition, while microgravity promotes equiaxed grain formation via reduced melt convection. The framework captures keyhole dynamics, thermal histories, and grain morphologies with high fidelity, validated against experimental data. These findings establish process microstructure relationships critical for reliable metallic fabrication in space and provide a reproducible platform for future in-space manufacturing research.</p>

            <p>Bosonic systems, such as photons and ultracold atoms, have played a central role in demonstrating quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\gg L$.</p>

            <h2>Universal TT- and TQ-relations via centrally extended q-Onsager algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pascal Baseilhac, Azat M. Gainutdinov, Guillaume Lemarthe</p>
            <p>Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra.</p>

            <h2>Generation of spin-squeezed states using dipole-coupled spins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Song, Nabiha Hasan, Susumu Takahashi</p>
            <p>Spins in solids and molecules are promising for applications of quantum sensing technology. The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realize a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity, and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <p>We study the universality of work statistics performed during a quench in gapless quantum systems. We show that the cumulants of work scale separately in the fast and slow quench regimes, following a power law analogous to the universal scaling in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for topological defect formation in phase transition. As an example, we analyze the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quenched Heisenberg XXZ chain at its critical gapless state using the bosonization picture, resulting in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The analytical scaling is in agreement with the exact numerical calculation for the fast and slow quench regimes. In finite systems, the characteristic function display an oscillatory pattern which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. This study is particularly useful for understanding the thermodynamics of adiabatic quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Single-mode magnon-polariton lasing and amplification controlled by dissipative coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Qi Wang, Zi-Yuan Wang, Yi-Pu Wang, J. Q. You</p>
            <p>We demonstrate single-mode lasing of magnon polaritons in a cavity magnonic system enabled by dissipative coupling between two passive modes, microwave cavity mode and magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble. The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Raymond Smith, Konstantinos Papatryfonos, David R. Selviah</p>
            <p>The development of compact, energy-efficient integrated lasers operating at 1.3 um remains a critical focus in silicon photonics, essential for advancing data communications and optical interconnect technologies. This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections. Moreover, the final design is shown to be robust to fabrication-induced deviations from nominal parameters.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries are quantum mechanical systems able to store and release energy in a controlled fashion. Among them, a special role is played by quantum structures defined as networks of two-level systems. In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.</p>

            <p>Optical cavities provide a powerful means to engineer light-matter hybrid states by coupling confined electromagnetic fields with matter excitations. Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.</p>

            <p>We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by the SymTFT construction of arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.</p>

            <p>We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy into electricity, making them promising candidates for harvesting waste heat, an increasingly important challenge in the energy-intensive modern world. The search for improved thermoelectric materials is therefore an active area of research in materials physics. Despite their fundamental and practical significance, thermoelectric properties - such as the Seebeck coefficient and power factor - are rarely explored in student labs due to the complexity in measurement schemes and requirement for sophisticated equipment. In this work, we present a user-friendly, low-cost and efficient thermoelectric measurement system built with Arduino and LabVIEW, which can simultaneously measure Seebeck coefficients and power factors as a function of temperature. This was made possible by improving the resolution of Arduino over ~1000 times with amplifiers and noise reduction schemes. With a total cost of only ~$100 and simple measurement protocols, this setup is well suited not only for student labs but also for efficient thermoelectric research.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full thermodynamic consistency in the linear-response regime. The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power. The approach provides a general platform for studying dissipation, pumping, and performance optimization in driven quantum devices operating as heat engines.</p>

            <p>We derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for the analysis of bulging or necking in an inflated hyperelastic tube of {\it finite wall thickness} from the three-dimensional finite elasticity theory by applying the dimension reduction methodology proposed by Audoly and Hutchinson (J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 97, 2016). The 1d model makes it much easier to characterize fully nonlinear axisymmetric deformations of a thick-walled tube using simple numerical schemes such as the finite difference method. The new model recovers the diffuse interface model for analyzing bulging in a membrane tube and the 1d model for investigating necking in a stretched solid cylinder as two limiting cases. It is consistent with, but significantly refines, the exact linear and weakly nonlinear bifurcation analyses. Comparisons with finite element simulations show that for the bulging problem, the 1d model is capable of describing the entire bulging process accurately, from initiation, growth, to propagation. The 1d model provides a stepping stone from which similar 1d models can be derived and used to study other effects such as anisotropy and electric loading, and other phenomena such as rupture.</p>

            <p>The dimensionality of a system profoundly influences its physical behaviour, leading to the emergence of different states of matter in many-body quantum systems. In lower dimensions, fluctuations increase and lead to the suppression of long-range order. For example, in bosonic gases, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in one dimension requires stronger confinement than in two dimensions. We experimentally study the properties of a harmonically trapped photon gas undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation along the dimensional crossover from one to two dimensions. The photons are trapped in a dye microcavity where polymer nanostructures provide the trapping potential for the photon gas. By varying the aspect ratio of the harmonic trap, we tune from an isotropic two-dimensional confinement to an anisotropic, highly elongated one-dimensional trapping potential. Along this transition we determine the caloric properties of the photon gas and find a softening of the second-order Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition observed in two dimensions to a crossover behaviour in one dimension.</p>

In addition, based on an analysis of the experimental parameters, we conclude that it is difficult to detect the relativistic effects of the work distribution of the ideal gas in a piston system with the current experimental techniques.</p>

With this we present a unified approach for both cooperative and competitive systems that display complementary behaviors. In particular we show the central role of an order parameter called the critical degree, $g_c$. In the competitive regime $g_c$ serves to distinguish high degree nodes that are more likely to go extinct, while in the cooperative regime it has the reverse role, it will determine the low degree nodes that tend to go relatively extinct.</p>

This approach relies on the spin cluster expansion combined with the disordered local moment (DLM) method, originally developed within the multiple scattering Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Applying it to a single-orbital Hubbard model with two sublattices, we show that the evaluated DLM biquadratic interactions are in good agreement with those obtained from the strongly correlated limit, demonstrating the wide applicability of the method to various magnetic systems with large local moments. We then apply it to the \textit{ab initio} tight-binding models for elemental magnetic metals; the resulting magnetic interactions align well with previous literature. Finally, we explore its performance in more complex compounds, such as transition metal dichalcogenides with intercalation of 3\textit{d} transition metals and potassium electrosodalite. The obtained results for both compounds show good agreement with experiments. The present approach offers a convenient \textit{ab initio} path for evaluating biquadratic interactions and understanding the electronic mechanisms controlling them.</p>

            <p>Bounded by crossover lines exhibiting universal scaling, the supercritical regime above the critical endpoint is characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercritical crossover to the quantum critical endpoint (QCEP), by studying the prototypical mixed-field quantum Ising and Potts models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities, near the QCEP. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is found, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is the so-called gap exponent of the QCEP. Moreover, we demonstrate that the QSC crossover line acts as a boundary for the emergence of dynamical singularities in quench dynamics. This singularity manifests as a distinctive cusp with a critical exponent of 1/2, signaling a new dynamical universality class. We also propose utilizing Rydberg atom arrays as an experimental platform to observe these QSC crossovers and dynamical singularities. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the role of QCEP and associated supercritical crossovers in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Yang, Yu Tian, Matteo Baggioli</p>
            <p>The possible existence of an exotic phase of matter rigid like a solid but able to sustain persistent and dissipation-less flow like a superfluid, a "supersolid", has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental efforts since the discovery of superfluidity in Helium-4. Recently, it has been proposed that nonlinear periodic modulations known as cnoidal waves, that naturally emerge in Bose-Einstein condensates, provide a promising platform to find and study supersolidity in non-equilibrium phases of matter. Nevertheless, so far the analysis has been limited to a one-dimensional zero-temperature system. By combining the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a finite temperature holographic model, we show that the proposed cnoidal wave supersolid phases of matter are dynamically unstable at finite temperature. We ascribe this instability to the dynamics of the "elastic" Goldstone mode, which arises as a direct consequence of translational order in the presence of dissipation, and establish a direct connection between the elastic-mode instability of the supersolid state and the nucleation of topological excitations during the relaxation towards a homogeneous equilibrium state, which resembles the Landau instability in superfluids. Finally, we numerically confirm the dominant role of the elastic-mode instability in the collision between cnoidal waves in the strong dissipation limit.</p>

            <p>In two-dimensional (2D) limit, the quantum fluctuation is significantly enhanced which could induce a quantum phase transition. Investigating the quantum criticality is an effective approach to elucidate the underlying physics of 2D superconductivity. Here we report the observation of different universality classes of quantum criticality at the superconducting LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) interface, i.e. the normal quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) and the anomalous QGS. The switch of the quantum criticality class is observed from the normal QGS in a low $T_c$ sample with weaker spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to the anomalous QGS in a high $T_c$ sample with stronger SOC. Moreover, owing to the remarkable SOC strength, the high $T_c$ sample exhibits an unprecedentedly enhanced quantum fluctuation at an unusually elevated temperature approaching the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature $T_{BKT}$. This work provides comprehensive recognition of the different quantum criticality classes in the same superconducting LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (111) system, which deepens the understanding of the superconducting mechanism of interfacial superconductors.</p>

In this work, we use a first-principles, material-specific theoretical treatment that is unbiased with respect to electronic instabilities to study the emergence of electronic ordering in twisted WSe\textsubscript{2} driven by gate-screened Coulomb interactions. We construct exponentially localized moiré Wannier orbitals that faithfully capture the bandstructure and topology of the system, project the gate-screened Coulomb interaction onto them and use unbiased functional renormalization group techniques to resolve the momentum and orbital structure of the leading instabilities and the relevant energy scales. We find an interplay between intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic (IVC-AFM) order and chiral, mixed-parity $d/p$-wave superconductivity for carrier concentrations near a displacement field and twist-angle-tunable van-Hove singularity. Our microscopic approach establishes incommensurate IVC-AFM spin fluctuations as the dominant electronic mechanism driving the formation of superconductivity in $\theta = 5.08^{\circ}$ twisted WSe\textsubscript{2} and explains key aspects of recent experiments including the asymmetric density dependence of the spin ordering with respect to the van-Hove line, the single and double-peak structure of the DOS in the ordered (hole-doped) IVC-AFM phase, the emergence of superconductivity as the density is varied across the van-Hove line and the evolution of the displacement field-density phase diagram with twist angles between $3.7^{\circ} \dots 5^{\circ}$.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and Accurate Spatial Mixing of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Materials Science</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fraser Birks, Matthew Nutter, Thomas D Swinburne, James R Kermode</p>
            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials can offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods we present ML-MIX, a CPU- and GPU-compatible LAMMPS package to accelerate simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities allowing deployment of modern MLIPs even under restricted computational budgets. We demonstrate our method for ACE, UF3, SNAP and MACE potential architectures and demonstrate how linear 'cheap' potentials can be distilled from a given 'expensive' potential, allowing close matching in relevant regions of configuration space. The functionality of ML-MIX is demonstrated through tests on point defects in Si, Fe and W-He, in which speedups of up to 11x over ~ 8,000 atoms are demonstrated, without sacrificing accuracy. The scientific potential of ML-MIX is demonstrated via two case studies in W, measuring the mobility of b = 1/2 111 screw dislocations with ACE/ACE mixing and the implantation of He with MACE/SNAP mixing. The latter returns He reflection coefficients which (for the first time) match experimental observations up to an He incident energy of 80 eV - demonstrating the benefits of deploying state-of-the-art models on large, realistic systems.</p>

            <h2>Ab Initio Theory of Phonon Magnetic Moment Induced by Electron-Phonon Coupling in Magnetic Materials</h2>

            <p>Circularly polarized phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of an approach to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in realistic materials. Here, based on the linear response framework, we develop an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced magnetic properties of phonons, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Our method can precisely calculate phonon Zeeman splittings in magnetic metals with significant EPC, as demonstrated by the remarkable agreement with recent experimental observations of phonon Zeeman splitting in the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2. In addition, the long-sought magnetic phonon spectra across the entire Brillouin zone are obtained, facilitating the study of magnetic phonon transport and topology. Specifically, by constructing an inertially decoupled lattice model, we propose candidate materials exhibiting intrinsic phonon Chern states with robust unidirectional edge phonon currents. Our work paves the way for investigating novel phonon phenomena in magnetic quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</p>

            <h2>Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay V. Gnezdilov, Rufus Boyack</p>
            <p>Migdal-Eliashberg theory of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ for strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In the conventional Migdal-Eliashberg theory, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and remains valid provided the vertex corrections are negligible. Depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in Migdal-Eliashberg theory saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</p>

            <p>We present a shifted magnetic bilayer that exhibits various magnetic phases and magnetic textures with arbitrarily large topological numbers. The proposed system is characterised by a mutually orthogonal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two different layers which can be induced by suitably placing non-magnetic atom with spin-orbit coupling. At weak interlayer coupling, the ground state resembles a checker-board pattern containing regions with unfavourable magnetic alignment which we call anti-aligned points. At finite interlayer coupling and finite external magnetic field, the bilayer can demonstrate a new class of magnetic solitons where multiple magnetic solitons can be connected by topological point defects which we call linked skyrmion. In addition to that the model also demonstrates conventional skyrmion-bags and $k\pi$-skyrmions. Finally, with rigorous first principle calculations, we propose a suitable material candidate where these magnetic configurations can be observed.</p>

            <p>We numerically show that a deep neural network (DNN) can learn macroscopic thermodynamic laws purely from microscopic data. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we generate the data of snapshot images of gas particles undergoing adiabatic processes. We train a DNN to determine the temporal order of input image pairs. We observe that the trained network induces an order relation between states consistent with adiabatic accessibility, satisfying the axioms of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the internal representation learned by the DNN act as an entropy. These results suggest that machine learning can discover emergent physical laws that are valid at scales far larger than those of the underlying constituents -- opening a pathway to data-driven discovery of macroscopic physics.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</p>

            <h2>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rule Yi, Violet Williams, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, {which persists at finite temperature}. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors via spin torque mediated by unbound electron-hole pairs and excitons: Signatures in magnonic charge pumping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing how femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) excites magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest an important role played by excitons. However, microscopic details of such an effect remain obscure, as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in the \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP is coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) residing on magnetic atoms of 2D AF semiconductors. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency {\em above} the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that becomes spin-polarized due to the background of LMMs, which, in turn, exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuinely nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to electronic bath. Finally, our theory also predicts that excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within 2D AF semiconductor, thereby emitting electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these two signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as possible presence of excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors across the magnetic first-order transitions of 2D and 3D Ising systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T<T_c$, where $T_c$ is the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as $h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i<0$ and stops at a positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the $L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive values $h_*>0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions, respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics in the TL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Bobok, Lukáš Frk, Vladislav Pokorný, Martin Žonda</p>
            <p>We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from \emph{Padé} approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable using exact diagonalization, and longer ones are handled with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with the dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sina Kazemian, Giovanni Fanchini</p>
            <p>Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters. In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still carry up to 40\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \textsc{elphbolt}, that capture mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas M. Michelitsch, Alejandro P. Riascos</p>
            <p>We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</p>

            <p>Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong Cheng, Tao Li</p>
            <p>The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, the nature of its ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive after about 30 years' intense debate. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH from the resonating valence bond(RVB) theory perspective. We find a highly competitive candidate ground state of the system. This novel state features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\vec{a}_{1}\times2\vec{a}_{2}\times2\vec{a}_{3}$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. Intriguingly, we find that within the RVB framework such a maximally resonating VBC state is almost degenerate with a recently proposed VBC state that is obtained from dressing hard hexagon covering of the pyrochlore lattice, although they have very different structures. We also find that further symmetry breaking will occur in the dressed hard hexagon VBC state under unrestricted optimization, which results in strong disparity in $\langle \hat{\mathbf{S}}^{2}_{u} \rangle$ for up and down tetrahedrons as we observe in the maximally resonating VBC state. We show that the maximally resonating VBC state found here will be favored by a tiny next-neighboring exchange coupling over the dressed hard hexagon covering VBC state.</p>

Finding methods to control the synthesis of hydrides can open up new pathways to unlock novel hydride compounds with desired properties. We introduced the idea of utilizing electrochemistry as an additional tuning knob and in this work, we study the synthesis of binary metal hydrides using high pressure, electrochemistry and combined pressure-electrochemistry. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the phase diagrams of selected transition metal hydrides under combined pressure and electrochemical conditions and demonstrate that the approach agrees well with experimental observations for most phases. We use the phase diagrams to determine trends in the stability of binary metal hydrides of scandium, yttrium and lanthanum as well as discuss the hydrogen-metal charge transfer at different pressures. Furthermore, we predict a diverse range of vanadium and chromium hydrides that could potentially be synthesized using pressure electrochemistry.

We demonstrate that the modulations can be described by some autoequivalences of the categories. Although the topological behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories. This structure not only recovers some known results on invertible modulated symmetries but also provides a general framework to tackle modulated symmetries in a more general setting.</p>

The study employs the transfer matrix method to derive fundamental thermodynamic characteristics of the system. The main results include exact expressions for the partition function, free energy, internal energy, specific heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and entropy in a strip of finite length and in the thermodynamic limit. The work provides explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and shows structure of eigenvectors of the transfer matrix. The expression for magnetization in the thermodynamic limit using components of normalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue is obtained. A detailed analysis is conducted for a special case of interactions involving all kinds of two- and four-spin interactions. This gives the simplified formula for free energy, it is calculated using the root of quadratic equation. Using special relation between parameters the solution for gonihedric model on the plane is obtained. The research reveals properties of the system, including specific features of ground states and phase diagram characteristics. Particular attention is given to the behavior of physical quantities near frustration points and the investigation of spin correlation functions.

            <p>We introduce the intrinsic nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect (NPTHE)-- a dissipationless thermal response proportional to $(\nabla T)^2B$, which arises when the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ lie within the same plane. The effect originates from a thermal gradient induced correction to the Berry curvature, characterized by the thermal Berry connection polarizability (TBCP) tensor, leading to a nonlinear transverse heat current independent of scattering time. A symmetry analysis shows that the intrinsic NPTHE is permitted only in noncentrosymmetric crystal point groups lacking horizontal mirror symmetry. Using a tilted Dirac model, we demonstrate that its characteristic angular dependence provides an effective means to control the nonlinear thermal response. Our results establish a new class of quantum geometry driven intrinsic nonlinear thermal transport, offering both a sensitive probe of band geometry and a pathway toward nonlinear thermal functionalities in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Xu, Kehan Cai, Pinchen Xie</p>
            <p>We hybridize the swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation methods to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of the lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. However, ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. Most Nb ions collapse into a single percolating cluster with a mesh-like structure. This specific geometry serves to prevent large space charges, and this behavior differs from typical phase separation in metallic alloys. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function that is consistent with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric properties of PMN.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interactions and suggests a strategy to boost its magnitude by harnessing band structure hot spots associated with orbital degeneracy.</p>

            <h2>Variationally Consistent Framework for Finite-Strain Microelasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tushar Jogi</p>
            <p>Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>We investigate theoretically how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It captures the combined effects of charge carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Yet, our model suggests that the Auger recombination alone is not sufficient to explain the increase of threshold currents at high doping concentrations. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights toward optimization of ICL carrier injectors.</p>

            <h2>Non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kei Matsushima, Takayuki Yamada</p>
            <p>This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</p>

We demonstrate the classical analogues of exclusion or bunching behavior expected in such states by studying their trajectories in various quadratic potentials. Our examples are two-particle coherent states in one dimension and two-particle vortex motion in the lowest Landau level. We finally compare and contrast our results with previous simulations of the full quantum system, and with existing results on the geometric interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neal Graneau</p>
            <p>The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its reality has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density ( > 10^9 A/m^2) including EM mass drivers such as railguns with liquid metal sliding contacts, flux compression generators and also high energy plasmas including fusion and other energy technologies. The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a supported copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE-Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the total current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique is described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of, and discrimination between, axial mechanical contact forces between solid and liquid metal as well as longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Ampère, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</p>

            <p>Phonon polaritons (PhPs) enable subwavelength light control for infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronics, but conventional polar materials have narrow Reststrahlen bands, limiting applications. Materials that support PhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor are therefore needed. Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes possess the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nm-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 x 10-5c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as versatile platforms for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</p>

            <h2>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Benini, Victor Carmona, Pieter Naaijkens, Alexander Schenkel</p>
            <p>This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under the typical assumption of Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick E. Mavromatos, Andreas Mershin, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos</p>
            <p>We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers arranged into the protofilaments of cytoskeletal microtubules. In the physical model proposed by the authors, the microtubule interiors are treated as high-Q quantum electrodynamics (QED) cavities that can support decoherence-resistant entangled states under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ sec. We identify strong electric dipole interactions between tubulin dimers and ordered water dipole quanta within the microtuble interior as the mechanism responsible for the extended coherence times. Classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models describing solitonic excitations are reinterpreted as emergent quantum-coherent-or possibly pointer-states, arising from incomplete collapse of dipole-aligned quantum states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer along microtubule filaments. We discuss logic-gate-like behavior facilitated by microtubule-associated proteins, and outline how such structures may enable scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage realized as a quDit encoded in the tubulin dipole state. We further describe a process akin to decision making that emerges following an external stimulus, whereby optimal, energy-loss-free signal and information transport pathways are selected across the microtubular network. Finally, we propose experimental approaches-including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes-to validate the use of biomatter as a substrate for scalable quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We recently proposed a method coupling quantum mechanics (QM) methods and molecular density functional theory (MDFT) to describe mixed quantum-classical systems [J. Chem.

We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.</p>

            <p>We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.</p>

            <p>While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p>

            <p>Slater determinants underpin most electronic structure methods, but orbital-based approaches often struggle to describe strong correlation efficiently. Geminal-based theories, by contrast, naturally capture static correlation in bond-breaking and multireference problems, though at the expense of implementation complexity and limited treatment of dynamic effects. In this work, we examine the interplay between orbital and geminal frameworks, focusing on perfect-pairing (PP) wavefunctions and their relation to pair coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) and Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states. We show that PP arises as an eigenvector of a simplified reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian expressed in bonding/antibonding orbital pairs, with the complementary eigenvectors enabling a systematic treatment of weak correlation. Second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory on top of PP is found to yield energies nearly equivalent to pCCD. These results clarify the role of pair-based ansätze and open avenues for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of orbital- and geminal-based methods.</p>

            <p>We investigate the physical consequences of having a spectrum that satisfies random matrix theory (RMT) for generic Lindbladians, and compare its implications for spatially local and completely random Lindblad dynamics in one spatial dimension. We find that Lindbladians whose spectrum is described by RMT exhibit quasi-universal early-time dynamics for quantities non-linear in the density matrix, in the sense that for generic, highly entangled initial states, the early time evolution is independent of the choice of initial state. We numerically investigate how locality generically imposes constraints on the size-dependence of Lindblad eigenoperators. This size dependence implies that linear observables, such as expectation values of local operators, are highly sensitive to eigenmodes outside the bulk of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit, and plays a central role in limiting operator growth in the presence of dissipation. We find that when single-site dissipation dominates, an operator's decoherence scales approximately linearly with its Pauli weight, even in the presence of 2-site jump operators. When two-site only dissipation dominates, however, this generic trend in operator size can be violated for numerically accessible system sizes, leading to long-lived high Pauli-weight operators.</p>

            <p>We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.</p>

We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Wildeboer, Marton Lajer, Robert M. Konik</p>
            <p>Confinement of fractionalized excitations can strongly restructure many-body spectra. We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $\Delta \sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $\Delta\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains.</p>

The role of nonabrupt interfaces between the materials is accounted for in our model by assuming a W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy around the interfacial region. Our results demonstrate that (i) interface-bound excitons are energetically favorable only for small interface thickness and/or for systems under high dielectric screening by the materials surrounding the monolayer, and that (ii) the interface exciton binding energy and its e-h overlap are controllable by the interface width and dielectric environment.</p>

In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Transport Spectroscopy of Pseudomagnetic Field in Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Divya Sahani, Sunit Das, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Amit Agarwal, Aveek Bid</p>
            <p>Nonuniform strain in graphene acts as a valley-dependent gauge field, generating pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) that mimic real magnetic fields but preserve global time-reversal symmetry. While local probes have visualized such fields, their quantitative detection via macroscopic transport has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that high-mobility graphene exhibits distinct beating patterns in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, arising from valley-resolved Landau quantization under different effective magnetic fields. Systematic analysis of these beats reveals universal quadratic and linear scaling of the node carrier density and Landau level filling factor with the applied magnetic field, enabling the extraction of PMFs as small as a few millitesla. Our results establish quantum oscillation spectroscopy as a robust and broadly applicable probe of strain-induced gauge fields in Dirac materials, opening avenues for mechanically tunable valleytronic and straintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Spin-lattice coupling induced chiral phonons and their signature in Raman Circular Dichroism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduard Koller, Swetlana Swarup, Johannes Knolle, Natalia B. Perkins</p>
            <p>Recent Raman experiments on the Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have reported a finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD), revealing chiral phonon behaviour not expected from lattice symmetry alone. To explain this observation, we develop a diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model. We demonstrate that bare phonons contribute no RCD, but coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing real polarization eigenvectors into complex superpositions with finite angular momentum. This interaction-induced modification generates a nonzero RCD accompanied by characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response, reflecting interference between discrete phonons and the continuum. The resulting signal grows with magnetic field strength, consistent with experiment, and directly tracks the field-induced chirality of the spin sector. More broadly, our results establish RCD as a powerful probe of interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siegfried Kaidisch, Amir Kleiner, Sivan Refaely-Abramson, Peter Puschnig, Christian S. Kern</p>
            <p>The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the $GW$+Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission, including a dependence on pump pulse polarization. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects and show how our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swagata Acharya, Dimitar Pashov, Daphne Lubert-Perquel, Mark van Schilfgaarde, Justin C. Johnson</p>
            <p>A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.</p>

            <p>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) offers a promising approach to decarbonize chemical manufacturing through production of carbon-neutral fuels. However, insufficient performance and instability of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors limit commercial viability, with both metrics directly impacted by the CO2R catalysts. Here we develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-NC) catalyst through a scalable synthesis approach using two different carbon supports. When using carbon nanotubes as the support, the resulting Ni-NCNT electrode achieves a partial current density toward CO of 558 mA cm-2 with 92 percent Faradaic efficiency toward CO at a cell voltage of 3.2 V and an energy efficiency of 39 percent toward CO at a total current density of 607 mA cm-2. The MEA demonstrates stable operation at 100 mA cm-2 over 210 hours, outperforming previously reported Ni-NC catalysts. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography illustrates the key role of catalyst support on the performance of the electrode. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations using 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers from FIB-SEM tomography demonstrate that the higher CO2R performance of the Ni-NCNT electrode is due to improved CO2 diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution compared to the Ni-NCB electrode prepared with carbon black as the support. The stability and performance of the Ni-NCNT compare favorably to state-of-the-art Ag-based catalysts, while bottom-up cost analysis estimates the purchase cost of the Ni-NCNT catalyst to be about 589 USD per kg, substantially lower than the 1900 USD per kg estimated for Ag-based catalysts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snigdh Sabharwal, Matthias Gohlke, Paul Skrzypczyk, Nic Shannon</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium topological phases of monolayer 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ under high-frequency circularly polarized driving using a low-energy $k\!\cdot\!p$ Hamiltonian combined with a van Vleck expansion. The off-resonant field generates spin- and valley-dependent mass corrections that reshape the Berry curvature profile and shift the conditions for band inversion. By evaluating the quasienergy bands, Berry curvatures, Hall conductivities, and spin- valley-resolved Chern numbers, we identify a sequence of light-controlled topological transitions marked by well-defined gap closings. Depending on the Floquet coupling strength and the electric-field parameter, the system evolves between the equilibrium quantum spin Hall (QSH) state and a set of driven phases including spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator (S-QHI), quantum valley Hall (QVH or BI) and photo-induced quantum Hall insulator (P-QHI) regimes. The results establish 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ as a tunable platform where circular driving selectively manipulates spin and valley degrees of freedom, enabling controlled access to non-equilibrium topological phases in transition-metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>Aggregation processes in systems of planar macromolecules and colloids drive a broad range of phenomena in natural systems and soft materials. Depending on chemical architecture, intermolecular interactions in these systems may favor different relative pair orientations, such as stacking face-face or percolating edge-edge arrangements. In this work, we employ a versatile coarse-grained interaction model for disk-like particles to provide a general framework to rationalize the thermotropic formation of aggregates and predict the topology of the resulting suprastructures. Monte Carlo and Brownian Dynamics simulations show that, with an appropriate tuning of the interactions, discotics spontaneously nucleate into clusters with globular, planar or stacked geometries, leading to materials with specific internal order and associated physicochemical properties.</p>

            <p>Fractionalized excitations such as spinons and anyons have emerged as a central theme in condensed matter physics with broad implications for superconductivity, quantum statistics, and quantum computation. The nearly ideal one-dimensional $S=1/2$ system $\beta$-VOSO$_4$ without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $\beta$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths. Our study showcases QFI as a probe of spin correlations in quantum magnets.</p>

            <p>We elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of the monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using a combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA). Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.</p>

            <p>In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.</p>

            <h2>Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debabrata Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.</p>

Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest, given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity or specific matching conditions with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to a few $10^{-7}$ T Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $10^{-8}$ T Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$) for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.</p>

            <p>This work quantifies the effect of misfit and threading dislocations on the surface (interfacial) energies of PbTe-PbSe interfaces, with the defect structures of the interfaces being obtained from atomistic and multiscale simulations of their manufacturing processes. Simulation results show that direct bonding produces semi-coherent interfaces with two-dimensional misfit dislocation networks, while heteroepitaxial processes produce complex three-dimensional dislocation structures with both misfit and threading dislocations. Surface energies at these interfaces were determined by computing the interaction energies across these interfaces. Compared with coherent interfaces, directly bonded interfaces exhibit up to ~23% lower surface energy, while the surface energies of epitaxially grown interfaces can be nearly 50% lower. The results demonstrate the significant effects of dislocations, which are unavoidable during the manufacturing processes of lattice mismatched heterostructures, on surface (interfacial) energy.</p>

            <h2>Hyperelastic stability landscape: A check for HILL stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelasticity depending on material parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Herbert Baaser</p>
            <p>In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.</p>

            <p>We perform cell segmentation on images from experimental studies of confluent, mobile cells in epithelial monolayers and show that these systems possess a broad, positively-skewed shape parameter distribution $P(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}=p^2/4\pi a$, $p$ is the perimeter, and $a$ is area of each cell. $P(\mathcal{A})$ is peaked at a value higher than the typical shape parameter $\mathcal{A}^* \sim 1.15$ that occurs for randomly packed, static confluent cell monolayers. The distribution does not arise from a heterogeneous population of cells with different fixed $\mathcal{A}$, nor can it arise from cell shape fluctuations from strains below the elastic limit. Instead, we find that all cells in each monolayer sample $\mathcal{A}$ values that span the full shape parameter distribution. We develop a deformable particle model that allows cell perimeter to adapt to local forces during cell motion, and this model recovers $P(\mathcal{A})$ to within $5\%$ for both MDCK and HaCaT epithelial cell monolayers. These results emphasize that confluent epithelial monolayers of mobile cells generate a well-defined broad shape parameter distribution that is independent of the initial cell shapes.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.</p>

            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model improves itself using its own predictions, has attracted attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD with a linear classifier for binary classification on noisy Gaussian mixture data. For the analysis, we employ the replica method from statistical physics. Our findings reveal that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also identify two practical heuristics to enhance SD: early stopping that limits the number of stages, which is broadly effective, and bias parameter fixing, which helps under label imbalance. To empirically validate our theoretical findings derived from our toy model, we conduct additional experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using pretrained ResNet backbone. These results provide both theoretical and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <p>Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</p>

Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $\alpha$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $\alpha$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $\alpha$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $\alpha$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $\alpha$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.</p>

            <h2>Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.</p>

            <h2>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Xuan Zhang, Seungbok Lee, Woonghee Cho, Je-Geun Park</p>
            <p>Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Biology, Quantum Simulation and Quantum Coherent Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong-Hang Chen, Jing Dong, Wen Yang, Qing Ai, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.</p>

            <h2>Stationary inverse-Wishart polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Barraquand, Zikun Ouyang</p>
            <p>A solvable model of directed polymer with matrix-valued disorder is introduced in arXiv:2203.14868. The disorder is made of $d\times d$ inverse-Wishart random matrices, so that the model nicely generalizes the well-studied log-gamma polymer, recovered when $d=1$. Much of the features of the log-gamma polymer seem to have analogues for higher $d$, although the integrability needs to be better understood. In this paper, we introduce stationary inverse-Wishart polymer models on a quadrant or a strip of $\mathbb Z^2$. In each setting, we identify stationary measures, characterized explicitly in terms of random walks with inverse-Wishart increments in special cases, or more complicated two-layer Gibbs measures for generic choices of boundary parameters. We also make conjectures about asymptotics of the free energy, and explain important differences between matrix-valued polymer models and their scalar counterpart, due to non-commutativity.</p>

            <h2>MiAD: Mirage Atom Diffusion for De Novo Crystal Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Okhotin, Maksim Nakhodnov, Nikita Kazeev, Andrey E Ustyuzhanin, Dmitry Vetrov</p>
            <p>In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

            <h2>Reflectivity-based refractive index measurement of van der Waals materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Zambrana-Puyalto, Alexander Johan Olsen, Søren Raza</p>
            <p>We present a reflectivity-based method for measuring the in-plane refractive index of transparent van der Waals (vdW) materials. The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \times 3$~{\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials.</p>

            <h2>Systems with Quantum Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikołaj Myszkowski, Mattia Damia Paciarini, Francesco Sannino</p>
            <p>We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</p>

            <h2>Dispersive shock waves in periodic lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su Yang, Sathyanarayanan Chandramouli, Panayotis G. Kevrekidis</p>
            <p>We introduce and systematically investigate the generation of dispersive shock waves, which arise naturally in physical settings such as optical waveguide arrays and superfluids confined within optical lattices. The underlying physically relevant model is a nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We consider the evolution of piecewise smooth initial data composed of two distinct nonlinear periodic eigenmodes. To begin interpreting the resulting wave dynamics, we employ the tight-binding approximation, reducing the continuous system to a discrete NLS (DNLS) model with piecewise constant initial data (i.e., a Riemann problem), where each constant state represents a discrete Floquet-Bloch mode at the continuum model level. The resulting tight-binding approximation is shown to display higher-fidelity for {deeper} periodic potentials. This reduced DNLS model effectively models the dynamics at the minima of the periodic potential of the original continuum NLS. Within such a single-band DNLS framework, we apply tools from Whitham modulation theory and long-wave quasi-continuum reductions to uncover and analyze a rich spectrum of non-convex, discrete dispersive hydrodynamic phenomena, comparing the resulting phenomenology with that of the periodic-potential-bearing continuum model.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Reactive-Load Impedance with Transmission-Line Resonators Beyond the Perturbative Limit</h2>

            <p>We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.</p>
