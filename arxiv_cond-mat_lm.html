            <h2>Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ting Tu, David M. Long, Dominic V. Else</p>
            <p>'t Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.</p>

            <h2>Magnetically ordered yet topologically robust phases emerging in concurrent Kitaev spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Akram, Aayush Vijayvargia, Hae-Young Kee, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Spin-orbital generalizations of Kitaev model, such as Yao-Lee model, have attracted recent attention due to their enhanced stability of spin liquid phases against perturbations. Motivated by microscopic calculations for the realization of Yao-Lee model showing additional interactions, we study the phase diagram of the Yao-Lee model with added Kitaev and Heisenberg terms. While the plaquette operator is conserved even in the presence of added perturbations, the model becomes no longer exactly solvable. Using perturbation and Majorana mean-field theory, we find magnetic order can arise in the spin sector while the orbital sector remains a liquid for dominant Kitaev interactions, whereas both sectors form liquid phases when Yao-Lee interactions dominate. Additional Heisenberg exchange can enhance or suppress the magnetic order, revealing a rich coexistence of magnetic and topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Large-scale characterization of Single-Hole Transistors in 22-nm FDSOI CMOS Technology</h2>

            <p>State-of-the-art quantum processors have recently grown to reach 100s of physical qubits. As the number of qubits continues to grow, new challenges associated with scaling arise, such as device variability reduction and integration with cryogenic electronics for I/O management. Spin qubits in silicon quantum dots provide a platform where these problems may be mitigated, having demonstrated high control and readout fidelities and compatibility with large-scale manufacturing techniques of the semiconductor industry. Here, we demonstrate the monolithic integration of 384 p-type quantum dots, each embedded in a silicon transistor, with on-chip digital and analog electronics, all operating at deep cryogenic temperatures. The chip is fabricated using 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS technology. We extract key quantum dot parameters by fast readout and automated machine learning routines to determine the link between device dimensions and quantum dot yield, variability, and charge noise figures. Overall, our results demonstrate a path to monolithic integration of quantum and classical electronics at scale.</p>

            <h2>Configurational Entropy and Adam-Gibbs Relation for Quantum Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhou, Ali Eltareb, Gustavo E. Lopez, Nicolas Giovambattista</p>
            <p>As a liquid approaches the glass state, its dynamics slows down rapidly, by a few orders of magnitude in a very small temperature range. In the case of light elements and small molecules containing hydrogen (e.g., water), such a process can be affected by nuclear quantum effects (due to quantum fluctuations/atoms delocalization). In this work, we apply the potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism and path-integral computer simulations to study the low-temperature behavior of a Lennard-Jones binary mixture (LJBM) that obeys quantum mechanics. We show that, as for the case of classical liquids, (i) a configurational entropy $S_{IS}$ can be defined, and (ii) the Adam-Gibbs equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient of a liquid and its $S_{IS}$, holds for the studied quantum LJBM. Overall, our work shows that one theoretical approach, the PEL formalism, can be used to describe low-temperature liquids close to their glass transition, independently of whether the system obeys classical or quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Charge-Transfer Complex $Îº$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ Analogous to Organic Spin Liquid Candidate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Kobayashi, Kent Andrew Sakurai, Shinji Michimura, Hiromi Taniguchi</p>
            <p>We report the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the organic conductor $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (BEST: bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-BEST-CN), which is isostructural with the quantum spin liquid candidate $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (ET: bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-ET-CN). Resistivity measurements demonstrate that $\kappa$-BEST-CN exhibits semiconducting behavior, governed by the same conducting mechanism as $\kappa$-ET-CN. Under a pressure of ~0.1 GPa, $\kappa$-BEST-CN undergoes a superconducting transition with an onset temperature of ~4 K. From the comparison of the critical pressures of superconductivity between $\kappa$-ET-CN and $\kappa$-BEST-CN, $\kappa$-BEST-CN can be regarded as a chemically pressurized analogue of $\kappa$-ET-CN. Therefore, $\kappa$-BEST-CN, in which only the effective pressure changes without altering the anion structure, is considered a valuable reference material for elucidating the enigmatic properties observed in $\kappa$-ET-CN. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility of $\kappa$-BEST-CN is slightly larger than that of $\kappa$-ET-CN and shows weaker temperature dependence, which cannot be explained by the localized spin model. This behavior clarifies the anomalous magnetic properties of a system with frustration near the Mott transition, serving to stimulate future theoretical research.</p>

            <h2>Excitation and tunneling spectra of a fractional quantum Hall system in the thin cylinder limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jyesta M. Adhidewata, Joel E. Moore</p>
            <p>The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu this http URL. (2023) show promise in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping to a 1D lattice Hamiltonian with center-of-mass or dipole moment conservation. In this work, we apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x \rightarrow \infty, L_y <l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$) to obtain an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the $\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.</p>

            <h2>Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect and Topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Shiba Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dibyendu Samanta, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a directional asymmetry in the critical supercurrents, typically requires external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry -- posing challenges for scalability and device integration. Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a d-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same FFLO phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding 45% without applied magnetic fields. The d-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free setting. The supercurrent-controlled finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO state modulates both the topological gap and the diode response. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Non-interacting fractional topological Stark insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hong Chen, Si-Yuan Chen, Xin-Chi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state, usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution, giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark insulator in real experiment.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Interference and Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling in a Chain of Planar Quantum Rings: Effects on Magnetic and Transport Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armen Harutyunyan</p>
            <p>Magneto-transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a chain of planar quantum rings are investigated under the Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a transverse homogeneous magnetic field. A modulation potential function models the ring-chain periodicity along one direction and the confinement in the perpendicular one. The electron energy minibands collapse into discrete levels with high degeneracy at specific magnetic field values. The Rashba effect significantly influences the system's properties. Calculations reveal a transition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the spin-difference orbital magnetization at high Rashba coupling strengths. This is consistent with the reversal of the spin-difference persistent current observed at the same Rashba values. Total and spin-difference magnetizations exhibit oscillations linked to miniband nodes. The longitudinal magnetoconductance component shows oscillations resembling Shubnikov-De Haas behavior, while the transverse component displays a ladder-like profile reminiscent of the quantum Hall effect. However, both phenomena are more closely associated with the periodic collapse of minibands, leading to strong density-of-states oscillations, rather than with the mechanisms behind the quantum Hall effect. This highlights the rich physics of quantum topological phases in nanostructures with non-trivial geometry. At high Rashba coupling, this behavior degrades. Spin magnetization shows pronounced oscillations, indicating complex interplay between the Zeeman and Rashba effects on spin polarization. These results offer insights into experimentally relevant electronic and spin characteristics attainable in modulated semiconductor structures, contributing to the development of advanced 2D-based materials for magneto-transport and spintronics applications.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Driven Altermagnetic Magnon Chiral Splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhejunyu Jin, Zhaozhuo Zeng, Jie Liu, Tianci Gong, Ying Su, Kai Chang, Peng Yan</p>
            <p>Nonrelativistic magnon chiral splitting in altermagnets has garnered significant recent attention. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear three-wave mixing -- where magnons split or coalesce -- extends this phenomenon into unprecedented relativistic regimes. Employing a bilayer antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, we identify three distinct classes of chiral splitting, each dictated by specific symmetries, such as $C_4T$, $\sigma_v T$, or their combination. This reveals a novel bosonic mechanism for symmetry-protected chiral splitting, capitalizing on the unique ability of magnons to violate particle-number conservation, a feature absent in low-energy fermionic systems. Our findings pave the way for engineering altermagnetic splitting, with potential applications in advanced magnonic devices and deeper insights into magnon dynamics in complex magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Strong correlation behavior and Strong coupling superconductivity in (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix with the rich magnetic element Ni</h2>

            <p>Searching for new superconductors, especially unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades but remains one of the major outstanding challenges in condensed matter physics. Medium/high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) are new fertile soils of unconventional superconductors and generate widespread interest and questions on the existence of superconductivity in highly disordered materials. Here, we report on the effect of Ni-doped on the crystal structure and superconductivity properties of strongly coupled TiHfNbTa MEA. XRD results indicate that the maximum solid solution of (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix is about 7.7%. Resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements demonstrated that (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix HEAs are all bulk type-II superconductors and follow the trend of the increase of Tc with the increase of Ni-doped contents. The specific heat jump of all (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix are much larger than the BCS value of 1.43, suggesting all these HEAs are strongly coupled superconductors. Additionally, large Kadawaki-Woods ratio values suggest that there is a strong electron correlation effect in this system. The (Ti1/4Hf1/4Nb1/4Ta1/4)1-xNix HEA system is a new ideal material platform for the study of strong correlation behavior and strongly coupled superconductivity, which provides an insight into the physics of high-temperature superconductors or other unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Heating Dynamics of Correlated Fermions under Dephasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Picano, Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco SchirÃ²</p>
            <p>We study the dissipative dynamics of correlated fermions evolving in presence of a local dephasing bath. To this extent we consider the infinite coordination limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, provided by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for open quantum systems. We solve the resulting quantum impurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing, using weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show that the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature, with a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting steady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay between coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how thermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the impurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization under open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed system case. In particular, the thermalization front found in the unitary is strongly modified, a signature of the irreversibility of the open system dynamics.</p>

            <p>Perovskite-type ternary nitrides with predicted exciting ferroelectricity and many other outstanding properties hold great promise to be an emerging class of advanced ferroelectrics for manufacturing diverse technologically important devices. However, such nitride ferroelectrics have not yet been experimentally identified, mainly due to the challenging sample synthesis by traditional methods at ambient pressure. Here we report the successful high-pressure synthesis of a high-quality ferroelectric nitride perovskite of CeTaN3-{\delta} with nitrogen deficiency, adopting an orthorhombic Pmn21 polar structure. This material is electrically insulating and exhibits switchable and robust electric polarization for producing ferroelectricity. Furthermore, a number of other extraordinary properties are also revealed in this nitride such as excellent mechanical properties and chemical inertness, which would make it practically useful for many device-relevant applications and fundamentally important for the study of condensed-matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Direct signatures of $d$-level hybridization and dimerization in magnetic adatom chains on a superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lisa M. RÃ¼tten, Eva Liebhaber, Gael Reecht, Kai Rossnagel, Katharina J. Franke</p>
            <p>Magnetic adatom chains on superconductors provide a platform to explore correlated spin states and emergent quantum phases. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we study the distance-dependent interaction between Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$. While single atoms exhibit four Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and partially occupied $d$ levels consistent with a $S=2$ spin state, the spin is quenched when two Fe atoms reside in nearest neighbor lattice sites, where the $d$ levels of the atoms hybridize. The non-magnetic dimer configuration is stable in that dimerization persists in chains with weak interactions among the dimers. Thus, the spin-state quenching has important implications also for Fe chains. While even-numbered chains are stable and non-magnetic, odd-numbered chains host a single magnetic atom at one of the chain's ends, with its position being switchable by voltage pulses. Our findings emphasize the role of interatomic coupling in shaping quantum ground states and suggest that engineering alternating hopping amplitudes analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model may offer a pathway to realizing topological systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R Eid (LCF), S Tiengo (LCF), M LÃ©vy (LCF), T Bourdel (LCF)</p>
            <p>Rabi-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, with competing intra-and interspecies interactions, enable independent control of two-and three-body interactions. We show that coupling can also drive the system into a strongly nonlinear regime of saturating interaction. More precisely, the equation of state interpolates between low-and high-density regimes described by two different two-body scattering lengths. Interestingly, the transition can be determined by the strength of the coupling. We experimentally demonstrate this saturation phenomenon by measurements of the interaction energy of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the detuning and of the strength of the Rabi coupling in spin mixtures of potassium 39.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Maria Forcella, Cesare Tresca, Antonio Sanna, Gianni Profeta</p>
            <p>Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.</p>

            <p>We study a dirty two-dimensional superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields described by the nonlinear sigma model that includes short-range electron-electron interactions from the Coulomb and Cooper channels. The renormalized Ginzburg-Landau theory, which includes the weak localization effects at the one-loop level, is constructed by using the Keldysh functional formalism. It is shown that the tricritical point appears in the phase diagram. The superconducting diode quality factor increases divergently as the system approaches the tricritical point. Near the superconducting phase transition lines, the absolute value of the diode quality factor decreases due to the cooperation of localization and interactions. The normal conductivity of the resistive state, in which the superconducting state is destroyed by the critical current, is calculated, and localization behaviors are demonstrated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Mushfiqul Islam, Nishat N. Labiba, Lawrence O. Hall, David S. Simmons</p>
            <p>Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</p>

            <h2>Free-fermion approach to the partition function zeros : Special boundary conditions and product form of solution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> De-Zhang Li, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Partition function zeros are powerful tools in understanding critical behavior. In this paper we present new results of the Fisher zeros of two-dimensional Ising models, in the framework of free-fermion eight-vertex model. First we succeed in finding special boundary conditions for the free-fermion model, under which the partition function of a finite lattice can be expressed in a double product form. Using appropriate mappings, these boundary conditions are transformed into the corresponding versions of the square, triangular and honeycomb lattice Ising models. Each Ising model is studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$. For the square lattice model we rediscover the famous Brascamp-Kunz (B-K) boundary conditions. For the triangular and honeycomb lattice models we obtain the B-K type boundary conditions, and the Fisher zeros are conveniently solved from the product form of partition function. The advantage of B-K type boundary conditions is that the Fisher zeros of any finite lattice exactly lie on certain loci, and the accumulation points of zeros can be easily determined in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding and method would be very helpful in studying the partition function zeros of vertex and Ising models.</p>

            <p>We show that strongly correlated impurities confined in an optical lattice can form localized, molecule-like dimer states in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By systematically studying the effect of the lattice potential on this mixture, we reveal the two roles of the condensate in assisting the formation of dimerized impurities: mediating the attractive interaction among impurities and rescaling the lattice potential of impurities. At strong coupling between the impurities and the condensate, the two mechanisms cooperate to induce a structural transition, resulting in the rearrangement of dimers. We also show that the nonequilibrium dynamics of these states can be interpreted as a dimerized soliton train.</p>

            <h2>Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Koliofoti, M. A. Javed, R.-P. Riwar</p>
            <p>The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal, or nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. Essentially there occurs a dissipative phase transition from a non-convex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. This resolves apparent inconsistencies and provide computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</p>

            <p>The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10$^8$ and 10$^6$ cm$^2$/Vs, respectively. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$ cm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.</p>

            <h2>Magnetization switching by current in an elemental ferromagnetic single layer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanyan Yang, Weiwei Lin</p>
            <p>Current-induced magnetization switching, a fundamental phenomenon related to spin-transport of electrons, enables non-voltaic and fast information write, facilitating applications in low-power memory and logic devices. However, magnetization switching by spin-orbit torques is usually attributed to current flowing in the nonmagnetic metal layer of multilayers or in magnetic alloys with heavy elements. Here, we report perpendicular magnetization switching induced by current flowing in an elemental ferromagnet nickel single layer. This prototype structure demonstrates that current-induced magnetization switching is a general phenomenon of magnet. The results suggest that the current induces an effective transverse magnetic field with an out-of-plane component leading to the magnetization switching, different to the conventional spin-orbit torques. Our work opens the new insight and reveals the intrinsic mechanism of current-induced torques.</p>

            <h2>Effect of applied pressure on the non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) of FeSb2 altermagnet: A first-principles study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalika R. Bhandari, R. Tamang, Keshav Shrestha, Samy Brahimi, Samir Lounis, D. P. Rai</p>
            <p>We have investigated the pressure-dependent electronic structure, phonon stability, and anomalous Hall response of the recently discovered altermagnet FeSb2 from density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis. From density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that FeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon frequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band crossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly lies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited by band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) along M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal (PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied pressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26 towards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M symmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along A-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A sharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally broadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and redistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that the values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as compared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results establish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can modulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering opportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niharika Tamuli, Saumen Acharjee</p>
            <p>We investigate the spin-polarized ballistic transport in a three-terminal Zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) device using a tight binding model, non-equilibrium Green function formalism within the Landauer-BÃ¼ttiker framework. We study the transmission spectrum, density of states, I-V characteristics, spin-resolved conductance and spin current by varying ribbon geometries and an out-of-plane Zeeman field. In absence of magnetization, transport is dominated by subband quantization and resonant edge states, with pronounced dependence on ribbon width and length while the introduction of a Zeeman field offers spin-selective transport and inducing half-metallic behavior, particularly in narrower ribbons, highlighting the interplay between quantum confinement, edge-localized states and spin-dependent interactions. Moreover, we found Fabry-PÃ©rot-like interference in conductance spectrum and bias-driven mode activation with strong spin filtering effects. The spin current is found to be tunable via magnetic field and gate voltage. Also, it remains stable under thermal fluctuations, demonstrating suitability for room-temperature operation. Finally, the energy and width dependence of the Fano factor reveals distinct quantum interference features and spin-polarized transport signatures. These findings indicate the potential of the three-terminal ZGNR based device for scalable and gate-controllable spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Multiscale complexity of two-dimensional Ising systems with short-range, ferromagnetic interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ibrahim Al-Azki, Valentina Baccetti</p>
            <p>Complex systems exhibit macroscopic behaviors that emerge from the coordinated interactions of their individual components. Understanding the microscopic origins of these emergent properties remains challenging, particularly in systems beyond canonical examples, due to the absence of a generalized framework for identifying the governing degrees of freedom. The multiscale complexity formalism aims to address this challenge by employing information-theoretic indices of structure to identify the scales at which collective behaviors emerge. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity profile index as a tool for identifying such scales by applying it to two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising systems. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit multiscale behavior in the critical region, and the emergence of macroscopic magnetization in the ordered phase corresponds to a non-monotonic behavior of the complexity profile at large scales. Additionally, we show that the pairwise complexity exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase that remains bounded in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Limits of Dissociative Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis via Electrodeposited Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Azumah, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan</p>
            <p>Electrochemical ammonia synthesis via lithium-mediated nitrogen dissociation has demonstrated exceptional Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions, but its viability is limited by a high energy cost of ~9.12 eV per NH3 via lithium electrodeposition. Here, we establish the thermodynamic limits for dissociative nitrogen reduction using elemental metals by decomposing the process into three steps: metal deposition, nitridation, and protonation. We derive energetic constraints that any viable mediator must satisfy and show that highly reducing metals impose significant energetic penalties. To reduce this cost, we explore solvent tuning and bimetallic alloy strategies that shift deposition potentials without compromising nitridation spontaneity. Our results offer design principles for lowering the energy input of dissociative nitrogen reduction while maintaining its selectivity advantage over associative routes.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changdon Shin, Sunghyun Yoon, Yongchul G. Chung</p>
            <p>Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), have emerged as a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations and PVSA cycle optimization. Structural parameters such as pore volume, pore size, and isosteric adsorption enthalpy were first calculated, followed by atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Process-level performances of the six materials were evaluated and optimized using the Thompson Sampling Efficient Multi-objective Optimization (TSEMO) algorithm. From the process-level optimization, we found that FumCALF-20 is the only material that can reach CH4 purity > 0.90 while maintaining high recovery. Other materials either lacked sufficient CO2 capacity or showed inefficient CH4 desorption at low pressures. This study underscores the value of process-level optimization in MOF evaluation and screening for energy-efficient biogas upgrading.</p>

            <h2>Polyurethane-Inspired CO2 Chemisorbent: Ab Initio Reaction Profiles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban</p>
            <p>Polyurethane (PU) and its numerous fine-tuned derivatives are widely employed as CO2 scavengers thanks to (1) physisorption and (2) functionalization of the PU backbone with other CO2 sorbents. In the present work, it has been unraveled why PU cannot exhibit CO2 chemisorption, despite possessing the nitrogen docking sites and exhibiting strong electrostatic sorbent-sorbate interactions. Furthermore, a few types of spatial separation of the active sorption sites have been proposed to unleash the chemisorption functionality of PU. By comparing various structural modifications of PU by using the in-silico methodology, we have identified that CO2 chemisorption by PU takes place in the case of implementing methyl and ethyl fragments between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of PU. Herewith, the introduction of the ethyl moiety even makes CO2 chemisorption energetically favorable relative to physisorption. The reported specific progress on materials design represents an obvious practical value for chemical engineers developing inexpensive CO2 scavengers.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Mechanisms of Polymer Crosslinking via Thermal Activation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javed Akhtar, Jogeswar Chhatria, Sooraj Kunnikuruvan, Satyesh K. Yadav, Tarak K. Patra</p>
            <p>Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast, bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS, respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB, especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation, universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</p>

            <p>We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Among the organic semiconductors, rubrene stands out in terms of hole mobility, luminescence yield and exciton migration distance. A novel type of rubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting zone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution, arising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit cell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal orientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially resolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has polarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high photon absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and transition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of the crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate coherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure mono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in the succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law scaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate equations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes, enabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics. These findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for photonic applications and light harvesting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatrice Donelli, Gabriele De Chiara, Francesco Scazza, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.</p>

            <p>We analyze quantum droplets formed in a two-dimensional symmetric mixture of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms. For sufficiently large atom numbers, these droplets exhibit a flat-top density profile with sharp boundaries governed by surface tension. Within the bulk of the droplet, traveling matter waves - localized density dips - can propagate at constant velocity while maintaining their shape. Using numerical simulations and qualitative analysis, we investigate the rich phenomenology that arises when such excitations reach the boundary of a finite droplet. We show that they can emit a small outgoing droplet, excite internal modes of the host soliton, or, in the case of vortex-antivortex pairs, split into individual vortices propagating backward near the edge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that traveling waves can be dynamically generated near the boundary through the collision of distinct droplets, and we discuss their trajectories and interactions.</p>

            <p>Polymeric turbulence, flows of fluids with dilute polymer additives at high Reynolds numbers, exhibits striking deviations from the Kolmogorovean behaviour of Newtonian turbulence. Recent experiments as well as simulations have uncovered a robust self-similar energy spectrum scaling as $k^{-2.3}$, in sharp contrast to the $k^{-5/3}$ scaling of Newtonian flows. The origin of this novel scaling, however, has remained unresolved. In this work, we uncover the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this emergent behaviour. Using fundamental governing equations aided by scaling arguments, we show that the fluid energy cascade is depleted by the polymers at a constant rate across a wide range of scales. This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant, alongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the spectrum. Our results reveal that polymeric turbulence is governed by two simultaneous invariants, unlike the single-invariant structure of Newtonian turbulence, and suggest new strategies for turbulence control through suitably engineered and targeted polymer design.</p>

The theoretical model reproduces the dynamic structure factor spectra and the corresponding dispersion characteristics in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation data without using any fitting parameters. In the limit of small wave numbers, the correspondence of the proposed theoretical model with the damped harmonic oscillator model is established. The simple analytical expression for the sound attenuation coefficient of strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas is obtained.</p>

            <p>Optical limiting (OL), a crucial mechanism for protecting human eyes and sensitive sensors from intense radiation, relies on understanding the optical nonlinearities acting on the systems. Assessing and disentangling the effects at play is crucial to predict and control the nonlinear optical response in real materials. In this ab initio study based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we investigate non-perturbatively the absorption spectra of a set of thiophene oligomers, the building blocks of technologically relevant organic semiconductors, excited by broadband radiation of increasing intensity. Under strong electric fields, the absorption cross section grows significantly below the onset of linear excitations, exhibiting saturation typical of OL. By exciting the oligothiophenes with a train of pulses targeting the first and second excited states of each moiety and analyzing the resulting population dynamics, we reveal excited-state absorption (ESA) in the near-infrared to visible region. Our results indicate ESA as the driving mechanism for OL in oligothiophene molecules, thereby providing important insight to design novel compounds with optimized nonlinear optical characteristics.</p>

            <p>Maxey \& Riley's (\textit{Phys. Fluids}, vol.~26, 1983, 883) analytical solution for the flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number tells us that the fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a contribution from the local flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary -- consisting of the drag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and another contribution from the stress of the background flow, termed generalized-buoyancy force. There is also a consensus that, for general disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial force density, resulting from averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of motion, decomposes in a likewise manner. However, there has been a long-standing controversy about the physical closure separating the generalized-buoyancy from the interfacial force density, especially whether or not pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds stress, should be attributed to the background flow. Furthermore, most existing propositions for this closure involve small-particle approximations. Here, we show that all existing buoyancy closures are mathematically inconsistent with at least one of three simple thought experiments designed to determine the roles of pseudo-stresses and small-particle approximations. We then derive the unique closure consistent with these thought experiments. It fully incorporates all pseudo-stresses, requires no approximation, and is supported by particle-resolved numerical simulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass filter property, attenuating buoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it from causing Hadamard instabilities, constituting a first-principle-based solution to the long-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When employing the derived closure, even the simplest two-fluid model, the dissipation-free one-pressure model, is hyperbolic.</p>

            <p>The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</p>

            <p>Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in oscillator systems.</p>

            <h2>Random Lozenge Waterfall: Dimensional Collapse of Gibbs Measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alisa Knizel, Leonid Petrov</p>
            <p>We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the q-Racah probability measure on lozenge tilings of a hexagon whose side lengths scale linearly with a large parameter $L$, while the parameters $q\in(0,1)$ and $\kappa\in \mathbf{i}\mathbb{R}$ remain fixed. This regime differs fundamentally from the traditional case $q\sim e^{-c/L}\to1$, in which random tilings are locally governed by two-dimensional translation-invariant ergodic Gibbs measures. In the fixed-q regime we uncover a new macroscopic phase, the waterfall (previously only observed experimentally), where the two-dimensional Gibbs structure collapses into a one-dimensional random stepped interface that we call a barcode. We prove a law of large numbers and exponential concentration, showing that the random tilings converge to a deterministic waterfall profile. We further conjecture an explicit correlation kernel of the one-dimensional barcode process arising in the limit. Remarkably, the limit is invariant under shifts by $2\mathbb{Z}$ but not by $\mathbb{Z}$, exhibiting an emergent period-two structure absent from the original weights. Our conjectures are supported by extensive numerical evidence and perfect sampling simulations. The kernel is built from a family of functions orthogonal in both spaces $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z}+\frac12)$, that may be of independent interest. Our proofs adapt the spectral projection method of Borodin-Gorin-Rains (https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0679) to the regime with fixed~q. The resulting asymptotic analysis is substantially more involved, and leads to non-self-adjoint operators. We overcome these challenges in the exponential concentration result by a separate argument based on sharp bounds for the ratios of probabilities under the q-Racah orthogonal polynomial ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Manipulating non-abelian anyons of Kitaev quantum spin liquids with local magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Wang, Alessandro Principi</p>
            <p>Non-abelian anyonic excitations of quantum spin liquids have potential for application to topological quantum computation, but designing logical operations requires developing protocols to faithfully create, move, and read-out such quasiparticles. In this paper, we present a protocol that manipulates the $Z_2$ fluxes (``visons''), and their bound Majorana zero mode, of the Kitaev model. This is achieved by adiabatically switching-off and -on interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, and applying a local magnetic field. We test our protocol by exchanging two Majorana zero modes, analysing the errors it produces. We find that the error rate of our protocol can be suppressed exponentially by increasing the adiabatic turn-on time and the size of the system. However, realistic implementations must consider the trade off between different error sources.</p>

            <h2>Ordered phases and superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems subject to pair spin-orbit interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Liu, Alessandro Principi</p>
            <p>Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</p>

            <p>The phase landscape of UTe$_2$ features a remarkable diversity of superconducting phases under applied pressure and magnetic field. Recent quantum oscillation studies at ambient pressure have revealed the quasi-2D Fermi surface of this material. However, the pressure-dependence of the Fermi surface remains an open question. Here we track the evolution of the UTe$_2$ Fermi surface as a function of pressure up to 19.5 kbar by measuring quantum interference oscillations. We find that in sufficient magnetic field to suppress both superconductivity at low pressures and incommensurate antiferromagnetism at higher pressures, the quasi-2D Fermi surface found at ambient pressure smoothly connects to that at 19.5 kbar, with no signs of a reconstruction over this pressure interval. We observe a smooth increase in oscillatory frequency with increasing pressure, indicating that the warping of the cylindrical Fermi sheets continuously increases with pressure. By computing a tight-binding model, we show that this enhanced warping indicates increased $f$-orbital contribution at the Fermi level - up to and beyond the critical pressure at which superconductivity is truncated. These findings highlight the value of high-pressure quantum interference measurements as a new probe of the electronic structure in heavy fermion materials.</p>

            <h2>Sub-ballistic operator growth in spin chains with heavy-tailed random fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher L. Baldwin</p>
            <p>We rigorously prove that in nearly arbitrary quantum spin chains with power-law-distributed random fields, namely such that the probability of a field exceeding $h$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$, it is impossible for any operator evolving in the Heisenberg picture to spread with dynamical exponent less than $1/\alpha$. In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\alpha < 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\alpha < 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This result thus establishes a wide family of models in which the disorder provably prevents conventional transport. We express the result as a tightening of Lieb-Robinson bounds due to random fields -- the proof modifies the standard derivation such that strong fields appear as effective weak interactions, and then makes use of analogous recent results for random-bond spin chains.</p>

            <p>Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by exploiting user-item similarities based on rating data, which often contains numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) are often employed. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. While previous studies have applied NBMF primarily to dense data such as images, this paper proposes a modified NBMF algorithm tailored for collaborative filtering with sparse data. In the modified method, unrated entries in the rating matrix are masked, enhancing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Finding an exact ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem (i.e., at least as hard as any problem in the nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) class). Given validity of the exponential time hypothesis, its computational complexity was proven to be no less than $2^{N^{2/3}}$, where $N$ is the total number of spins. Here, we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\le 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, which scales as $2^{N/ \beta}$ with $\beta\approx 10^3$. Based on statistical analysis of low-energy states, we argue that with an improvement of annealing protocols and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. This suggests that, for $N<\beta^3$, annealing devices provide most efficient way to find an exact ground state.</p>

            <p>The destruction of metallicity due to the mutual Coulomb interaction of quasiparticles gives rise to fascinating phenomena of solid state physics such as the Mott metal-insulator transition and the pseudogap. A key observable characterizing their occurrences is the single-particle spectral function, determined by the fermionic self-energy. In this paper we investigate in detail how real space fluctuations are responsible for a self-energy that drives the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. To this aim we first introduce a real space fluctuation diagnostics approach to the Hedin equation, which connects the fermion-boson coupling vertex $\lambda$ to the self-energy $\Sigma$. Second, by using cellular dynamical mean-field theory calculations for $\lambda$ we identify the leading physical processes responsible for the destruction of metallicity across the transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Mu, Di Wang, Xiangang Wan</p>
            <p>It is widely accepted that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) generally locks spin and spatial degrees of freedom, as a result, the spin, despite being an axial vector, is fixed and cannot rotate independently, and the magnetic system should be described by magnetic space groups (MSGs). While as a new type of group, spin space groups (SSGs) have been introduced to approximately describe the symmetry of magnetic systems with negligible SOC, and received significant attention recently. In this work, we prove that in two cases of coplanar spin configurations, there are spin-only operations that strictly hold even with considerable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the symmetry of their spin models could be described by the spin-coplanar SSG. In addition, we also find that for spin-collinear cases, regardless the strength of DMI, the magnon systems within the framework of linear spin wave theory (LSWT) also preserve the decoupled spin and spatial rotations, but the symmetry does not belong to the conventional definitions of collinear spin groups. We discuss the potential realization of these novel symmetries in rod, layer, and three-dimensional (3D) space groups. Our work extends the applicability of SSGs to magnetic materials with heavy elements, and reveals that the coexistence of DMI and SSG symmetries provides new opportunity for exploring novel magnon transport phenomena, and potential material realization had also been discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram</p>
            <p>The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> BÃ¶rge GÃ¶bel, Lennart Schimpf, Ingrid Mertig</p>
            <p>Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), a phenomenon wherein chiral structures selectively determine the spin polarization of electron currents flowing through the material, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as spintronics, enantioseparation, and catalysis. The underlying physical effect is the Edelstein effect that converts charge to angular momentum. Besides a spin contribution there exists a contribution based on the orbital angular momentum but the precise mechanism for its generation remains yet to be understood. Here, we introduce the minimal model for explaining the phenomenon based on the orbital Edelstein effect. We consider non-local inter-site contributions to the current-induced orbital angular momentum and reveal the underlying mechanism by analytically calculating the Edelstein susceptibilities in a tight-binding and Boltzmann approach. While the orbital angular momentum is directly generated by the chirality of the crystal, the spin contribution of each spin-split band pair relies on spin-orbit coupling. Using tellurium as an example, we show that the orbital contribution surpasses the spin contribution by orders of magnitude.</p>

            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>In this study, we present an experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised of viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The appearance and growth of bubbles are connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes simultaneously oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. For large nuclei, bubbles grow anisotropically because of contact line pinning. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.</p>

            <p>Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha < 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha > 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.</p>

            <p>The electronic band gap of a two-dimensional semiconductor within a device architecture is sensitive to variations in screening properties of adjacent materials in the device and to gate-controlled doping. Here, we employ micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to separate band gap renormalization effects stemming from environmental screening and electron-doping during \textit{in situ} gating of a single-layer WS$_{2}$ device. The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed to vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We directly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap renormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap renormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the graphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the WS$_2$. Using $GW$ calculations, we determine that intrinsic screening due to stronger doping in vacuum exposed WS$_2$ exceeds the external environmental screening in graphene-encapsulated WS$_2$.</p>

Within this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required to infer the Boltzmann distribution. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic relations and fluctuation-dissipation relations naturally emerge from this framework.

            <p>Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.</p>

            <p>Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is approximately quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasiparticle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping away from half-filling, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states away from the $\Sigma$ gap edge may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity and other instabilities of doped Mott insulators.</p>

Applying intense terahertz radiation, we observed that the photoconductivity saturates at high intensities, which was found to be caused by absorption bleaching. Both the magnitude of the photoconductivity and the saturation intensity are shown to exhibit an exponential dependence on the hydrostatic pressure. We show that this is a consequence of the fact that both phenomena are controlled by the ratio of energy and momentum relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Although nanocrystalline alloys regularly exhibit high strengths, their use in structural applications often face challenges due to sample size limitations, unstable microstructures, and the limited ability to plastically deform. The incorporation of amorphous grain boundary complexions has been proposed to address these issues, by simultaneously stabilizing nanocrystalline grain structures for scale-up processing and improving alloy toughness. In the present study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is examined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is relevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated via a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures and times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural and property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered cubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles exhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles. Appreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800 MPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions. Microstructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area fraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most importantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with increasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly enhancing plasticity. The hierarchy present in the microstructure of the Al-Mg-Y alloy, from amorphous grain boundary complexions to secondary phases, gives rise to excellent bulk mechanical properties, which are attractive for structural applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrej Vilfan, Bogdan Cichocki, Jeffrey C. Everts</p>
            <p>We study the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on a sphere in a static anisotropic porous medium. This problem is analysed using the Brinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or permeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid within a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the friction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small anisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result against the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid in a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying self-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to small tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.</p>

            <h2>Coulomb Interaction-Stabilized Isolated Narrow Bands with Chern Numbers $\mathcal{C} > 1$ in Twisted Rhombohedral Trilayer-Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vo Tien Phong, Cyprian Lewandowski</p>
            <p>Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moirÃ© materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Microwave resonator for measuring time-reversal symmetry breaking at cryogenic temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Chouinard, D. M. Broun</p>
            <p>We present a microwave-frequency method for measuring polar Kerr effect and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in unconventional superconductors. While this experiment is motivated by work performed in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, the microwave implementation is quite different, and is based on the doubly degenerate modes of a TE$_{111}$ cavity resonator, which act as polarization states analogous to those of light. The resonator system has $in$-$situ$ actuators that allow quadrupolar distortions of the resonator shape to be controllably tuned, as these compete with the much smaller perturbations that arise from TRSB. The most reliable way to the detect the TRSB signal is by interrogating the two-mode resonator system with circularly polarized microwaves, in which case the presence of TRSB shows up unambiguously as a difference between the forward and reverse transmission response of the resonator - i.e., as a breaking of reciprocity. We illustrate and characterize a coupler system that generates and detects circularly polarized microwaves, and then show how these are integrated with the TE$_{111}$ resonator, resulting in a dilution refrigerator implementation with a base temperature of 20 mK. We show test data on yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) ferrite and the van der Waals ferromagnet CrGeTe$_3$ as an illustration of how the system operates, then present data showing system performance under realistic conditions at millikelvin temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee</p>
            <p>The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Antola, Sebastiano Battisti, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto, Giorgio De Simoni</p>
            <p>In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</p>

            <p>The nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves (SWs) offers opportunities for developing novel functional magnonic logic devices, where controllability is crucial for magnetic signal processing. Domain walls act as natural waveguides due to their magnetic configuration, offering a platform for the in-depth investigation of nonreciprocal SW propagation and its manipulation. In this work, we theoretically and numerically investigate the tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels under the influence of an external field. It is revealed that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exerts dual control over both nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation and spin-splitting phenomena. Moreover, SW nonreciprocity is magnetically tunable, with its sign reversibly switched by inverting the applied field direction, while preserving the host spin configuration. The orientation of the magnetic field can selectively stabilize or destabilize the domain wall structure, offering precise control over spin-wave nonreciprocity. Ultimately, we demonstrate a controllable SW transmission scheme via external magnetic field modulation, providing critical insights for the design of future magnonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic fluctuation theory and the absorption of Brownian particles by partially reactive targets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul C Bressloff</p>
            <p>We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations in a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a generalised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target surfaces. The exterior surface $\partial \Omega$ is maintained at a constant density $\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced path for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated path integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising small current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the corresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting stationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the spectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We illustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular annulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on the rate of absorption $\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple partially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the case of partially absorbing targets ($0<\kappa<\infty$), the covariance matrix for current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of particle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally absorbing limit $\kappa\rightarrow \infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the covariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the targets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain $\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.</p>

            <p>We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories.</p>

This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo A. Dourado, Jeroen Danon, Martin Leijnse, RubÃ©n Seoane Souto</p>
            <p>The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.</p>

            <p>Predicting the stationary behavior of observables in isolated many-body quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum statistical mechanics. While one can often use the Gibbs ensemble, which is simple to compute, there are many scenarios where this is not possible and one must instead use another ensemble, such as the diagonal, microcanonical or generalized Gibbs ensembles. However, these all require detailed information about the energy or other conserved quantities to be constructed. Here we propose a general and computationally easy approach to determine the stationary probability distribution of observables with few outcomes. Interpreting coarse measurements at equilibrium as noisy communication channels, we provide general analytical arguments in favor of the applicability of a maximum entropy principle for this class of observables. We show that the resulting theory accurately predicts stationary probability distributions without detailed microscopic information like the energy eigenstates. Extensive numerical experiments on 7 non-weakly interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians demonstrate the broad applicability and robustness of this framework in both quantum integrable and chaotic models.</p>

            <p>This study employs deep learning techniques to segment scanning electron microscope images, enabling a quantitative analysis of carbide precipitates in lower bainite and tempered martensite steels with comparable strength. Following segmentation, carbides are investigated, and their volume percentage, size distribution, and orientations are probed within the image dataset. Our findings reveal that lower bainite and tempered martensite exhibit comparable volume percentages of carbides, albeit with a more uniform distribution of carbides in tempered martensite. Carbides in lower bainite demonstrate a tendency for better alignment than those in tempered martensite, aligning with the observations of other researchers. However, both microstructures display a scattered carbide orientation, devoid of any discernible pattern. Comparative analysis of aspect ratios and sizes of carbides in lower bainite and tempered martensite unveils striking similarities. The deep learning model achieves an impressive pixelwise accuracy of 98.0% in classifying carbide/iron matrix at the individual pixel level. The semantic segmentation derived from deep learning extends its applicability to the analysis of secondary phases in various materials, offering a time-efficient, versatile AI-powered workflow for quantitative microstructure analysis.</p>

            <p>Optical tweezer arrays have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.</p>

            <p>A solid transparent medium with randomly positioned, immobile impurity atoms is a promising candidate for observation of Anderson localization of light in three dimensions. It can have low losses and allows for mitigation of the detrimental effect of longitudinal optical fields by an external magnetic field, but it has its own issues: thermal oscillations of atoms around their equilibrium positions and inhomogeneous broadening of atomic spectral lines due to random local electric fields. Our calculations suggest that these complications should not impede observation of Anderson localization of light in such materials provided that sufficiently high number densities of impurities can be reached. The thermal oscillations hardly affect light propagation whereas the inhomogeneous broadening can be compensated for by increasing the number density of impurities.</p>

            <p>We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</p>

The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification.

            <p>Radio-frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer network, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30MHz serves as both an intrinsic inductor and a power-sharing element. The design enables high current delivery and flexible impedance matching across a wide frequency range. We integrate both broadband and narrowband RF networks into a unified configuration that overcomes the geometric constraints imposed by the metallic chamber. In evaporative cooling, the broadband network allows a reduction of the applied RF input power from 14.7dBW to -3.5dBW, owing to its non-zero coil current even at ultra-low frequencies. This feature enables the Bose-Fermi mixture to be cooled below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the coil driven by the narrowband network transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F = 2,mF = 2> to |2,-2> in 1 millisecond, achieving a Rabi frequency of approximately 9 kHz at an input power of 0.1dBW.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p>Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</p>

            <h2>Cyclotron reonance in a kagome spin liquid candidate material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons. Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered spin-liquid candidate material YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <h2>Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory of Molecular Systems: Localized Orbital-Based Embedding from an Exact Density-Functional Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Makhlouf, B. Senjean, E. Fromager</p>
            <p>Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Exciton dynamics and exciton-phonon coupling in bulk and thin flakes of layered van der Waals antiferromagnet Ni2P2S6</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nasaru Khan, Yuliia Shemerliuk, Sebastian Selter, Bernd BÃ¼chner, Saicharan Aswartham, Pradeep Kumar</p>
            <p>The Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet is an intriguing quantum state offering potential to realize a spin-orbit-entangled bosonic quasiparticle, which gives rise to the Zhang-Rice exciton. Its formation is attributed to the correlation between a localized d-orbital of a transition metal and the p-orbitals of the neighbouring ligands. The layered two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic Ni2P2S6 system provide an excellent platform to probe the ZR exciton dynamics along with the role of exciton-phonon coupling. Here, we present a comprehensive study of ZR exciton and coupling with the phonons in bulk and few-layered single crystals of Ni2P2S6 using temperature, polarization and power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At cryogenic temperatures, the PL spectra reveal distinct phonon sidebands spaced by an energy difference of nearly 117 cm-1, indicative of exciton-phonon hybridization. Polarization-resolved measurements demonstrate a strong optical anisotropy, with a linear polarization degree of ~ 40 % at 4 K. Excitation power variation highlights linear scaling of PL intensity in the low-power regime, followed by spectral deformation at higher powers attributed to the phonon-assisted recombination and exciton saturation effects. ZR exciton and phonon side bands survival temperature decreases with decreasing flake thickness suggesting their tunability. The emergence and suppression of phonon sidebands with temperature and flake thickness emphasize dimensional sensitivity and coherence limits of excitonic states. Our findings position Ni2P2S6 as a promising candidate for tunable and anisotropic optoelectronic applications, while offering insight into quasiparticle interactions in 2D magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>A radical restructuring of the optical response of highly excited electron-hole plasma formed in a mesoscopic GaAs/AlGaAs channel in a quantizing magnetic field when an electric current flows in the channel has been discovered. In the absence of current, the emission spectra are caused by transitions between Landau levels formed in the conduction band and in the valence band of heavy holes. A critical electric current leads to a drastic change in the emission spectra with a predominant contribution from light holes. It is shown that the current causes local accumulation of light holes due to Coulomb drag, which leads to strong electron-hole coupling and, as a consequence, the formation of excitons and trions.</p>

            <p>We report the electronic structure of the thermoelectric semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with a large thermoelectric power factor and giant Peltier conductivity by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The ARPES spectra reveal the coexistence of a sharp hole band with a light electron mass and a broad electron band with a relatively heavy electron mass, which originate from different quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) chains in Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$. Moreover, the electron band around the Brillouin-zone (BZ) boundary shows a replica structure with respect to the energy originating from plasmonic polarons due to electron-plasmon interactions. The different scattering effects and interactions in each atomic chain lead to asymmetric transport lifetimes of carriers: a large Seebeck coefficient can be realized even in a semimetal. Our findings pave the way for exploring the thermoelectric materials in previously overlooked semimetals and provide a new platform for low-temperature thermoelectric physics, which has been challenging with semiconductors.</p>

            <p>We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar phase transition observed.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity emerging from the N${Ã©}$el state in ${\it infinite}$-${\it stage}$ single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+Î´}$</h2>

            <p>In copper oxides (cuprates) with single CuO$_2$ layer such as La$_{2-x}$Ba(Sr)$_x$CuO$_4$, antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity at small doping levels $x$, where chemical disorders are significant.

A uniform oxygen distribution in the crystal is crucial for achieving microscopic phase coexistence and overcoming the miscibility gap associated with the staging instability; self-organized periodic oxygen arrangement driven by mobile oxygen atoms. This finding prompts the reconsideration of superconductivity in cuprates, highlighting that it can emerge in a robust N${Ã©}$el state that retains sizable magnetic moments and hosts only a small carrier density.</p>

            <p>Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically Iron-Germanium-Telluride ($\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ at sub-micron spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Angle-dependent chiral tunneling in biased twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadia Benlakhouy, El Mustapha Feddi, Abdelouahed El Fatimy</p>
            <p>In twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), chiral tunneling can be tuned by parameters such as the twist angle, barrier height, and Fermi energy. This differs from the tunneling behavior observed in monolayer and Bernal bilayer graphene, where electrons either pass completely through or are fully blocked due to the Klein paradox. Here we investigate the effect of a perpendicular interlayer bias on electron tunneling through electrostatic barriers in TBLG. Using a dual-gated model, which controls the carrier density and interlayer potential difference independently, we compute the transmission and reflection probabilities of electrons at different angles and energies for representative twist angles of $\theta = 1.8^{\circ}$, $3.89^{\circ}$, and $9.43^{\circ}$. We find that a moderate bias suppresses normal-incidence transmission by opening a band gap in the low-energy spectrum. Our results show this leads to near-total reflection at low energy, with transmission starting to increase just above the gap due to twist-dependent conducting channels. The applied bias breaks the system's effective inversion symmetry, resulting in pronounced direction-dependent and valley-specific asymmetries in the angular distribution of transmitted electrons. We show that electrons incident at different angles show notable variations in transmission under bias. Furthermore, interlayer bias modulates Fabry--PÃ©rot--like resonances in the TBLG barrier, shifting the energies of transmission peaks and altering their intensity.</p>

Such halos emerge in star-like systems with exponentially decaying couplings, as we show using both free-fermions and the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Depending on the central connectivity, entanglement halos may exhibit trivial and non trivial symmetry-protected topological features. Our findings highlight how geometry and connectivity can generate complex entanglement structures with rich physical content, which can be experimentally accessible via state-of-the-art technologies.</p>

            <p>Understanding the collective actuation of microscopic structures driven by external fields can lead to the development of next-generation autonomous machines. With this goal in mind, we investigated light-induced collective motion of thermocapillary microswimmers at the air-water interface. We found that Marangoni forces, which lead to long-ranged repulsive interparticle interactions, can cause microswimmers to synchronize their circular motion in a collective chase mode that resembles predator-prey behavior often observed in nature. We examined different degrees of confinement in small systems containing 2-6 particles of different individual swimming velocities and shapes. Thanks to the strong repulsive interactions between particles, a sustained chasing mode was observed for particle packing fractions above a critical value of 0.25. At lower packing fractions, swimmers transition between chasing, bouncing, and intermittent pausing, likely due to time-varying activity levels. Additionally, we report that a new synchronized mode can be introduced by incorporating chirality in particle shapes, where the microswimmers collectively reverse the direction of their circular motion periodically. Our results point to a simple but powerful mechanism of obtaining collective synchronization in synthetic confined systems where particles are designed with different shapes and activity levels.</p>

            <p>We study the geometric contribution to the superfluidity in quasicrystals in which the conventional momentum-space quantum geometric tensor cannot be defined due to the lack of translational invariance. Based on the correspondence between the momentum and magnetic flux, we introduce the flux-space quantum metric in finite-size closed systems and reveal its contribution to the superfluid weight in quasicrystalline superconductors. As a toy model, we study the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci quasiperiodic stub lattices that host flat energy spectra even in the presence of quasiperiodic hoppings. In the weak-coupling limit, we establish the relation between superfluid weight and the flux-space quantum metric in quasicrystal superconductors with flat energy spectra. Moreover, by analyzing the spread of Wannier functions, we propose a general fluctuation mechanism that explains how quasiperiodicity modulates the integrated flux-space quantum metric. Our theory provides a general way to examine the effect of the quantum geometry in systems lacking translational symmetry.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials hold the potential for ultra-scaled ferroelectric (FE) devices due to their silicon compatibility and robust polarization down to atomic scale. However, the inherently weak vdW interactions enable facile sliding between layers, introducing complexities beyond those encountered in conventional ferroelectric materials and presenting significant challenges in uncovering intricate switching pathways. Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in-situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group-IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90 degrees switching pathway and a direct 180 degrees switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song-Bo Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu</p>
            <p>Non-relativistic spin-splitting in unconventional antiferromagnets has garnered much attention for its promising spintronic applications and open fundamental questions. Here, we uncover a unique even-parity spin texture in chiral non-collinear antiferromagnets, exemplified using a kagome lattice. We consider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with SchrÃ¶dinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior. Remarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an exotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors. The triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the antiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between singlet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This mixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in order parameters and 0-$\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions. Additionally, we analyze the effect of out-of-plane spin canting, elucidating its role in generating spin-polarized supercurrents, and discuss Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Ge to test our predictions.</p>

            <p>We study the model for spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square lattice in the presence of spin vacancies. In order to overcome the methodological challenges associated with analyzing models with magnetic frustration and inhomogeneities, we introduce a new semi-classical approach in which singlet dimers are treated as effective classical degrees of freedom. The energetic and entropic aspects of the dimer formation are included via a classical Monte Carlo scheme that allows for the dynamical conversion of spin pairs into dimers and vice versa. We show that our semi-classical approach recovers the qualitative physics of the J1-J2 model in the absence of vacancies. The vacancies lead to a broadening of the spin-liquid regime between the NÃ©el and the stripe antiferromagnetic phases. This suggests a possible new route to discover spin-liquid ground states by tuning the J2/J1 ratio in doped square lattice antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>Here, we report experimental evidence suggesting the emergence of robust, possibly chiral, edge states in artificially engineered multilayers composed of alternating nanometer-thick layers of nonmagnetic aluminum (Al) and ferromagnetic nickel (Ni). Using phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry, we observed distinct SQUID-like oscillations (instead of the conventional Fraunhofer patterns) in the maximum supercurrent versus in-plane probing magnetic field patterns, which can be associated with one-dimensional current-carrying modes localized at the sample boundaries. These results were obtained for multilayers consisting of up to ten Al/Ni bilayers sandwiched between superconducting Nb electrodes to form Josephson junctions. The spatially confined flow of supercurrent suggests the possible presence of chiral Andreev edge states reminiscent of those found in higher-order topological insulators, despite the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling or intrinsic topological band structure. The discovery of edge-localized charge transport in structures made of materials without intrinsic topological order challenges the prevailing understanding of topological phenomena and highlights the possibility of developing topological metamaterials as a tunable platform for exploring nontrivial edge physics.</p>

Here, we develop a high-pressure quantum transport technique for van der Waals heterostructures, achieving the ultimate pressure limit (~9 GPa) in encapsulated moirÃ© devices. In aligned graphene/h-BN, we demonstrate that pressure induces a substantial enhancement of the moirÃ© potential strength, evidenced by the suppression of the first valence bandwidth and the near-doubling of the primary band gap. Moreover, we report the first observation of a tertiary gap emerging above 6.4 GPa, verifying theoretical predictions. Our results establish hydrostatic pressure as a universal parameter to reshape moirÃ© band structures.

            <p>Solid matter is classified through symmetry of ordering phenomena. Experimentally, this approach is straightforward, except when distinct orderings occur with identical or almost identical symmetry breaking. Here we show that the cuprate system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ hosts two distinct orderings with almost identical translational symmetry breaking. Only when applying site-sensitive resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), charge ordering can be conclusively differentiated from a super-lattice structure. These two orderings occur with almost the same in-plane symmetry but manifest at different atomic sites and display different temperature dependence. Differentiating these orders provides an important clue to the anomalous behavior of PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ within the 123-series of high-temperature superconductors. We conclude that the symmetry breaking at the Pr-site is unfavorable for superconducting pairing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shmuel Gurvitz, Dmitri Sokolovski</p>
            <p>We present a transparent and analytically tractable approach to the problem of time-dependent electron transport through tunneling barriers. Using the Single-Electron Approach, we study a model system composed of a time-dependent tunneling barrier coupled to two reservoirs of finite bandwidth. Avoiding Floquet expansions, we derive simple expressions for the time-dependent tunneling current in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. Our formulation, based on the tunneling Hamiltonian framework, relates barrier modulation to measurable phase shifts in the steady-state current, offering a physically intuitive definition of the tunneling (or traversal) time. Remarkably, in the Markovian limit (wide-band reservoirs), we recover the well-known result of vanishing tunneling time. In contrast, for finite-bandwidth leads, we predict a finite time delay given by the inverse bandwidth. Our findings provide a robust foundation for understanding tunneling dynamics in non-Markovian environments and may serve as a benchmark for experimental investigations involving tunable band structures.</p>

            <p>We introduce an exactly solvable lattice model that reveals a universal finite-size scaling law for configurational entropy driven purely by geometry. Using exact enumeration via Burnside's lemma, we compute the entropy for diverse 1D, 2D, and 3D lattices, finding that the deviation from the thermodynamic limit $s_{\infty} = \ln (z)$ scales as $\Delta s_{N} \sim N^{-1/d}$, with lattice-dependent higher-order corrections. This scaling, observed across structures from chains to FCC and diamond lattices, offers a minimal framework to quantify geometric influences on entropy. The model captures the order of magnitude of experimental residual entropies (e.g., $S_{\mathrm{molar}} = R \ln 12 \approx 20.7 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}$) and provides a reference for understanding entropy-driven order in colloids, clusters, and solids.</p>

            <h2>Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel SÃ¡nchez SÃ¡nchez, Tobias Stauber</p>
            <p>We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable to characterize MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.</p>

            <h2>Sliding Engineering Spin-Valley-Layer Coupling and Altermagnetism in Bilayer Antiferromagnetic Honeycomb Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Xin Jiang, Zhen-Hao Gong, Yuantao Chen, Zhigang Gui, Li Huang</p>
            <p>Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical phase transition in a strongly hybridized phonon-triplon chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Yarmohammadi</p>
            <p>We study a dimerized spin-1/2 chain, such as CuGeO$_3$, hosting triplon excitations coupled to optical phonons under weak terahertz laser driving. Both phonons and triplons weakly lose energy into the surrounding baths, forming a non-equilibrium steady state. In the strong phonon-triplon coupling regime, phonons near the two-triplon continuum hybridize strongly with triplons. Using mean-field Lindblad dynamics, we show that this strong hybridization induces sharp first-order phase transitions -- either single or simultaneous double -- in the emission spectrum, mainly due to dissipation-induced nonlinearities. Using mean-field Floquet analysis of harmonic modes in both sectors, we analytically confirm the existence of these phase transitions. Furthermore, we map the complete steady-state phase diagram by varying key control parameters and provide experimentally relevant parameters for observing these transitions in laser-driven CuGeO$_3$.</p>

            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), particularly at half-filling of Landau levels, provides a unique window into topological phases hosting non-Abelian excitations. However, experimental platforms simultaneously offering large energy gaps, delicate tunability, and robust non-Abelian signatures remain scarce. Here, we report the observation of a cascade of even-denominator FQH states at filling factors ${\nu}$ = ${-5/2}$, ${-7/2}$, ${-9/2}$, ${-11/2}$, and ${-13/2}$, alongside numerous odd-denominator states in mixed-stacked pentalayer graphene, a previously unexplored system characterized by intertwined quadratic and cubic band dispersions. These even-denominator states, representing the highest filling half-filled states reported so far in the zeroth Landau level (ZLL), emerge from two distinct intra-ZLL and exhibit unprecedented displacement field tunability driven by LL crossings in the hybridized multiband structure. At half fillings, continuous quasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch states, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external fields. Numerical calculations, revealing characteristic sixfold ground-state degeneracy and chiral graviton spectral analysis, suggest the observed even-denominator FQH states belong to the non-Abelian Moore-Read type. These results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a rich and versatile crystalline platform for exploring tunable correlated topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Measuring coherence factors of states in superconductors through local current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo A. Dourado, Jeroen Danon, Martin Leijnse, RubÃ©n Seoane Souto</p>
            <p>The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP)--a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengpu Huang, Zheng Qin, Fangyang Zhan, Dong-Hui Xu, Da-Shuai, Rui Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Z.Z. Alisultanov, A. Kudlis</p>
            <p>We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunnelling, known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists: the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes. Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we analyse edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the enhanced overlap permits tunnelling between opposite edges and pulls the longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.</p>

            <p>Chiral molecular systems offer unique pathways to control spin and magnetism beyond conventional symmetry operations. Here, we demonstrate that chiral ionic liquids enable electric-field modulation of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism in FeSi(111) thin films via electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) gating. FeSi hosts chemically-stable, surface-confined ferromagnetism without bulk moments, making the interfacial spins highly responsive to chiral-ion adsorption. Using both achiral and chiral ionic liquids, we systematically compare electrochemical and electrostatic gating effects. While both gating modes modulate magnetic properties such as anomalous Hall conductivity and coercive field, only chiral ionic gating biases the ratio of up- and down-magnetized domains in a handedness-dependent manner, evidencing chirality-induced symmetry breaking. This work establishes chiral ion gating as a novel strategy for controlling magnetic order and opens new directions for chiral spintronics.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive investigation of CeGaSi single crystals, including magnetic, thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetotransport properties. The powder x-ray diffraction refinement revealed that CeGaSi crystallizes in LaPtSi-type tetragonal structure with space group I41md. The electrical resistivity data show a metallic nature with a sharp drop occurring around T_m = 11 K, revealing a magnetic phase transition, which is confirmed by magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data. The magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and heat capacity data are analyzed through the crystalline electric field based on point charge model, suggesting that the six degenerate ground states of Ce3+ (J = 5/2) ion split into three doublets with an overall splitting energy = 288 K. The maximum negative magnetoresistance in CeGaSi for both B\parallel c and B\parallel ab field-direction is observed near T_m, it is attributed to the suppression of spin-disorder scattering by the magnetic field. The Hall resistivity data for B \parallel c and B\parallel ab show anomalous Hall signal. Our scaling analysis suggests that anomalous Hall effect in CeGaSi is dominated by the skew scattering mechanism. In addition, first-principles calculations identify CeGaSi as a nodal-line metal.</p>

            <p>Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of a biochemical clock is shaped using the KaiABC system. A phase diagram constructed as a function of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a sharply bounded limit-cycle region, which naturally explains arrhythmia upon protein over-expression. Beyond the Hopf bifurcation, intrinsic noise enables regular oscillation via coherence resonance. Within the limit-cycle region, greater rhythmic precision incurs a higher energetic cost, following the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The cost-minimizing period of the KaiABC clock ($\sim$21-hr) is close enough to entrain to 24-hr cycle of environment. Our study substantiates universal physical constraints on the robustness, precision, and efficiency of noisy biological clocks.</p>

            <p>The spatially resolved near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoscale probe and a substrate is studied in the fluctuational electrodynamics framework within the dipolar approximation. It is shown that the introduction of a thin polar film atop a non-dispersive substrate can lead to both an enhancement and a lateral focusing of the heat exchange. The influence of the probe--substrate separation, film thickness and substrate permittivity is analyzed, revealing that the effect originates from near-field interactions governed by the interplay between film-induced modifications of electromagnetic mode dispersion and the distance-dependent coupling strength. The results highlight a viable route toward the active control of local radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale.</p>

Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</p>

            <h2>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pui In Ip, Shina Tan</p>
            <p>We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</p>

We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.</p>

            <p>Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are nanostructured hybrid materials with unique emergent functional properties. Given their periodically arranged building blocks, they also offer interesting parallelisms with crystalline materials. They can be processed in multiple forms and at different scales, and crosslinking their organic ligands via heat treatment leads to a remarkable boost of their mechanical properties. This study shows, via X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission (STEM) electron microscopy analyses, how each of these processing steps plays a distinct role in the generation, migration, interaction and healing of supercrystalline defects. Pressing of SCNCs into bulk pellets leads to a distortion of the otherwise fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles (SPs) with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Interestingly, heat treatment at the same temperatures as those applied for the organic crosslinking has significant effects on planar defects. Stacking faults migrate and get healed, as also confirmed via molecular dynamics simulations, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries undergo structural changes. These rearrangements of defects at the supercrystalline scale (tens of nm) in nanocomposites with such remarkable mechanical properties (compressive strength of 100-500 MPa) provide new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles.</p>

            <h2>When does hyperuniformity lead to uniformity across length scales?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Vanoni, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 < \alpha < 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.</p>

            <p>We study the Green's functions in non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the critical non-Hermitian skin effect (critical NHSE) using a double-chain Hatano-Nelson model with inter-chain coupling $\Delta$. For $\Delta=0$, the system decouples into two independent chains, and the Green's functions follow predictable patterns based on the GBZ theory. For small $\Delta$ ($\Delta=1/10000$), in conventional regions with trivial OBC spectral winding numbers, inter-chain coupling induces a zigzag scaling structure in Green's functions due to competition between the two chains, explainable by first-order perturbation theory. In anomalous regions with non-trivial winding numbers, Green's functions match GBZ predictions in the bulk but diverge near boundaries, with residual contributions from the $\Delta=0$ GBZ accounting for the deviations. These results reveal the unique non-perturbative features of critical NHSE and highlight the limitations of GBZ theory in capturing finite-size and boundary effects, emphasizing the need to consider both bulk and boundary dynamics in such systems.</p>

            <p>The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is an important property for predicting phase formation in alloys. It can be estimated in a large compositional space from pair wise interactions between elements, for which machine learning has recently provided the most accurate predictions. Further improvements requires acquiring high quality data in liquids where models are poorly constrained. In this study, we propose an active learning approach to identify in which liquids additional data are most needed to improve an initial dataset that covers over 400 binary liquids. We identify a critical need for new data on liquids containing refractory elements, which we address by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for 29 equimolar alloys of Ir, Os, Re and W. This enables more accurate predictions of the enthalpy of mixing, and we discuss the trends obtained for refractory elements of period 6. We use clustering analysis to interpret the results of active learning and to explore how our features can be linked to Miedema's semi empirical theory.</p>

Further, we analyze the average work performed on the particle and the heat dissipated into the environment at all times, illustrating the nonequilibrium character of the system and its relaxation into a steady state.

            <p>Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the deformation behavior of disperse polymer melts by tracking test chains of length N = Mw, the weight average molecular weight, in melts of varying dispersity. At high strain rates, stress decreases with increasing dispersity up to the critical stretch ratio. After flow cessation, relaxation is anisotropic: the parallel component of the radius of gyration decreases monotonically with dispersity, but the perpendicular component exhibits non-monotonic behavior, with fast relaxation at low to intermediate stretching ratios, and slower relaxation at higher stretching ratios as dispersity increases. Single-chain structure factor shows a similar trend in the perpendicular direction, with fast relaxation at intermediate length scales in disperse systems, while the parallel component remains unaffected by dispersity. These findings reveal the complex, dispersity-dependent anisotropic relaxation mechanisms in moderately entangled polymer melts far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We investigate a two-dimensional polydisperse suspension of self-propelled semiflexible filaments and reveal a collective wrapping mechanism that is absent in monodisperse systems. At intermediate activity levels, long filaments coil around shorter ones, forming nested spiral structures stabilized by filament length disparity. These assemblies generalize the single-filament spiraling seen in active systems into cooperative, multi-filament configurations. As activity increases, the nested spirals undergo structural transitions: medium-length filaments unwind, longer filaments encapsulate shorter ones, and eventually all spiral structures dissolve. This reorganization is reflected in the dynamics, where van Hove distributions uncover coexisting confined and motile filament populations. Our findings identify filament length as a key control parameter for nonequilibrium self-assembly and establish inter-filament wrapping as a minimal mechanism for hierarchical organization in active matter. This mechanism provides a simple model for the cooperative confinement and structural hierarchy observed in both biological and synthetic active systems.</p>

            <p>Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on fundamental quantum mechanical properties.</p>

            <h2>Spectral distribution of sparse Gaussian Ensembles of Real Asymmetric Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratul Dutta, Pragya Shukla</p>
            <p>Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.</p>

            <p>PtPb$_4$ is a type II superconductor with a bulk critical temperature $T_{c}\approx 3 $K and an upper critical field of $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. PtPb$_4$ is related to non-superconducting PtSn$_4$, which presents nodal arc states at the surface. Here we measure the superconducting density of states of PtPb$_4$ using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We observe a fully opened superconducting gap of $\Delta=0.48$\ meV similar to expectations from Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory ($\Delta_0=1.76k_BT_{c}=0.49 $meV). Measurements under magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the surface show a spatially inhomogeneous gap structure, presenting superconducting signatures at fields as high as 1.5 T, significantly above $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. On some locations we find that the superconducting density of states does not vanish above $T_{c}$. We can find signatures of a superconducting gap up to 5K. We discuss possible reasons for the observation of superconducting properties above $T_{c}$ and $H_{c2}$, emphasizing the role played by structural defects.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Irreversible Particle Adsorption to Fluid Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Pasquet, Yu Fu, Joelle Frechette</p>
            <p>Understanding the dynamic adsorption of colloidal particles at fluid interfaces is essential for applications ranging from emulsion stabilization to interfacial assembly of functional materials. Adsorption dynamics is often described through diffusion-limited models (such as the Ward-Tordai framework) along with assuming dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed and dispersed particles. However, most experiments show that particle adsorption is irreversible, and diffusion-limited models fail as the surface coverage goes beyond the dilute limit where particle crowding limits further adsorption. Here, we present a unified model that captures the transition from diffusion-limited to kinetic-limited regimes by coupling diffusion with a Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA)-based boundary condition that accounts for irreversible adsorption and particle blocking for a spherical droplet. Using both a microtensiometer and pendant drop tensiometry, we measure dynamic interfacial tension changes for 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) particles at the toluene/water interface across a range of bulk concentrations, drop sizes, and particle functionalization. Our analysis shows that the adsorption flux becomes increasingly hindered as the surface area fills, in agreement with RSA predictions. Furthermore, we calculate the Thiele modulus as a dimensionless number that quantifies the relative importance of adsorption kinetics to diffusion. We find that above a critical surface coverage, adsorption becomes reaction-limited, marking a transition to kinetically controlled dynamics. This approach provides a predictive framework for particle adsorption at fluid interfaces and highlights the necessity of moving beyond equilibrium diffusion-limited models.</p>

            <p>The shrinking core model describes the reaction of a spherical solid particle with a surrounding fluid. In this work, we revisit the SCM by deriving it from the underlying physical processes and performing a careful non-dimensionalisation, which highlights the limitations of the commonly used pseudo-steady-state approximation, particularly in liquid-solid systems where fluid and solid densities are comparable. To address these limitations, we derive approximate analytical solutions using a perturbation method that improves upon the pseudo-steady-state model. We also obtain a small-time solution capturing early transient behavior. A semi-implicit finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the full model numerically and benchmark the analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the perturbation solution provides significantly improved accuracy over the pseudo-steady-state model, especially in diffusion-limited regimes. Finally, we propose a simple fitting procedure combining the perturbation with the early-time solutions to estimate physical parameters from experimental data at minimal computational cost.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the strong-correlation phenomenology observed near the superconducting phase in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we study multi-orbital $t$-$J$ models that are derived from different parameter regimes. The models contain effective antiferromagnetic interactions that are influenced by the strong underlying spin-orbit coupling. The possible superconducting pairing states are investigated in these models. We find that the preferred pairing order parameters are associated with the $^{1,2}E$ representations of the three-fold rotation symmetry operator $C_3$, with the $p\pm i p$ component intermixing with the $d\pm id$ component. The chiral superconducting states are shown to be topological, based on the Wilson loops of the corresponding Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We discuss the implications of our findings for experimental observations, as well as the new connections our results uncover between the moirÃ© superconductivity and its counterpart in bulk quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingzhi Wang, Zohar Nussinov, Gerardo Ortiz</p>
            <p>Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.</p>

            <p>We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen, Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu, Ho Won Lee</p>
            <p>MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data, most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective. MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40% improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.</p>

            <p>Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.

We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.</p>

            <p>Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li</p>
            <p>A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants, namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA (MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.</p>

            <p>We construct an ultraviolet-complete, local, and unitary quantum field theory in 2+1 dimensions that exhibits spontaneous breaking of space-time parity, persisting to arbitrarily high temperatures. The theory is defined by a renormalization group trajectory, triggered by a relevant deformation of a conformal field theory, consisting of a critical biconical vector model and a free massless Dirac fermion. This deformation couples the fermion to the scalar sector, generating a renormalization group flow that terminates at a nontrivial infrared fixed point described by a conformal Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and a decoupled critical vector model. By construction, the quantum field theory is parity invariant at zero temperature. However, we show that at sufficiently high temperatures, parity symmetry is spontaneously broken and remains so even in the infinite-temperature limit. Our analysis relies on both, perturbative renormalization group techniques in $4\!-\!\epsilon$ dimensions and functional renormalization group techniques directly in 2+1 dimensions.</p>

We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and compatibility with subgroup structures.</p>

            <p>Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</p>

Employing a full polaron transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's phase transition at SC.</p>

            <p>Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)D theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.</p>

            <p>Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices, representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot carrier transport and scalable electrically driven nanophotonic applications.</p>

We provide a rigorous derivation of boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic fields at temporal interfaces with precise assumptions on the material parameters. In turn, we use this to obtain a general Snell's Law at such interfaces. From this, we obtain explicit formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients. Unlike previous works, we do not make any simplifying ansatz on the solution to the Maxwell system, nor do we assume that the fields are smooth. We also consider material parameters which are not necessarily constant on either side of the temporal interface.</p>

            <h2>Anyonic Josephson junctions: Dynamical and ground-state properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica John Britto</p>
            <p>Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics. Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.</p>

            <h2>Device-scale modeling of valley photovoltaics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daixi Xia, Hassan Allami, Jacob J. Krich</p>
            <p>We present a Poisson/drift-diffusion model that includes valley scattering effects for simulating valley photovoltaic devices. The valley photovoltaic concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.</p>

In particular, fabrication-induced fluctuations in device parameters such as capacitance and Josephson critical current pose significant challenges to large-scale integration.

This approach enables the evaluation of the performance of superconducting quantum circuits with 10000 qubits on standard laptop computers. The proposed method provides an accessible tool for the early stage assessment of large-scale superconducting quantum circuit performance.</p>

            <h2>Poliazed Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quanum Sysmtes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunsuke A. Sato, Hannes HÃ¼bener, Umberto De Giovannini, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>We introduce a new theoretical framework --the polarized Houston basis-- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The electromagnetic response of metasurfaces can be intentionally engineered by carefully designing their unit cells. Narrowband metasurfaces, characterized by high quality factors, can serve as an efficient platform for biosensing in optical to THz regimes, to explore new structural forms of biomolecules, further elevating the capabilities of THz sensing technologies. In this study, an all-metallic metasurface featuring structural asymmetry is proposed to analyze L-Cysteine with orthorhombic and monoclinic crystallographic structures. The influence of the concentration of L-Cysteine in the monoclinic phase on the THz response of the metasurface was performed using a drop-casting method. Our findings reveal a noticeable frequency shift as analyte concentration raises, underscoring the potential for high sensitivity in detecting biomolecules. Thus, this research demonstrates that asymmetric THz metasurfaces offer rather promising detection capabilities at lower THz frequencies between two crystallographic structures of L Cysteine, with a Q-factor of 37, and a sensitivity of 1.430 THz ml/g. We believe that our results can be of great value to the development of biosensors for improved material characterization at low frequencies.</p>

            <p>Optical feedback is a well-known method of controlling laser dynamics, which has been widely studied in photonic systems to induce complex behaviors such as chaos or enhanced coherence. However, its application to systems in the strong light-matter coupling regime remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce a delayed optical feedback loop into a nonresonantly pumped polariton condensate. By feeding part of the emission back into the cavity to seed the next condensate, we observe a strong increase in the output intensity, up to 110%. We explain this effect using a classical rate equation model for the condensate coupled to excitonic reservoirs. Our results evidence that polariton condensates can respond strongly to optical feedback, congruent with well known polariton amplification techniques using resonant pump-probe setups. Our method opens new possibilities for using polariton feedback to connect multiple condensates and can be an essential step toward neuromorphic computing based on recurrent signaling in photonic systems.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the quantum XYZ open spin-1/2 chain with boundary fields. We focus on the particular case in which the six boundary parameters are related by a single constraint enabling us to describe part of the spectrum by standard Bethe equations. We derive for this model exact representations for a set of elementary blocks of correlation functions, hence generalising to XYZ the results obtained in the XXZ open case in arXiv:2208.10097. Our approach is also similar to the approach proposed in the XXZ case arXiv:2208.10097: we solve the model by Sklyanin's version of the quantum Separation of Variables, using Baxter's Vertex-IRF transformation; in this framework, we identify a basis of local operators with a relatively simple action on the transfer matrix eigenstates; we then use the solution of the quantum inverse problem and our recent formulae on scalar products of separate states arXiv:2402.04112 to compute some of the corresponding matrix elements, which can therefore be considered as elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. The latter are expressed in terms of multiple sums in the finite chain, and as multiple integrals in the thermodynamic limit. Our results evidence that, once the basis of local operators is properly chosen, the corresponding building blocks for correlation functions have a similar structure in the XXX/XXZ/XYZ open chains, and do not require any insertion of non-local "tail operators".</p>

            <h2>Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement in quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Takahashi, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small, with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.</p>

            <p>Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is fundamental for understanding the behavior of molecules and crystals, influencing phenomena such as charge transport, energy transfer, phase transitions, and polaron formation. Accurate computational methods to calculate EPCs from first principles are essential, but their complexity has resulted in a variety of computational strategies, raising concerns about their mutual consistency. In this study, we provide a systematic benchmark of methods for EPC calculation by comparing two fundamentally different {\it ab initio} methodologies. We investigate Gaussian-type orbital methods based on the \textsc{CP2K} code and plane-wave-based projector-augmented-wave (PAW) methods combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, as implemented in \textsc{VASP} and \textsc{wannier90}. In addition, we further distinguish between the derivative--of--Hamiltonian ($dH$) and derivative--of--states ($d\psi$) approaches for obtaining EPC parameters. The comparison is conducted on a representative set of organic molecules, including pyrazine, pyridine, bithiophene, and quarterthiophene, varying significantly in size and flexibility. We find excellent agreement across implementations and basis sets when employing the same computational approach ($dH$ or $d\psi$), demonstrating robust consistency between the numerical schemes. However, noticeable deviations occur when comparing the $dH$ and $d\psi$ approaches within each code and for specific cases discussed in detail. Our findings emphasize the reliability of EPC computations using the $dH$ method and caution against potential pitfalls associated with the $d\psi$ approach, providing guidance for future EPC calculations and model parameterizations.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast optical control of magnetic textures offers new opportunities for energy-efficient, high-speed spintronic devices. While uniform magnetization reversal via all-optical switching is well established, the formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) under ultrafast excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we use Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. We observe a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Multiscale simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics reveal a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs. This nonequilibrium mechanism explains the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering, and establishes a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials on femtosecond timescales.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states. These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define an algorithm to identify BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and robustness analyses. Applying the algorithm to the Hofstadter model on the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal. Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can change depending on the Fermi energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akhil Panicker, Sasidevan V</p>
            <p>During an epidemic outbreak, individuals often modify their behavior in response to global prevalence cues, using spatially mediated adaptations such as reduced mobility or transmission range. In this work, we investigate the impact of distance-based adaptive behaviors on epidemic dynamics, where a fraction of the population adjusts its transmission range and susceptibility to infection based on global prevalence. We consider three adaptation scenarios: a constant adaptive fraction, a power-law dependence and a sigmoidal dependence of adaptive fraction on global prevalence. In the spatially well-mixed regime, we analytically obtain critical adaptation thresholds necessary for epidemic mitigation and in the spatially static regime, we establish bounds for the thresholds using continuum percolation results. Our results indicate that a linear adaptive response to prevalence provides no additional advantage over a constant adaptive fraction in controlling outbreaks, and a highly super-linear response is required to suppress epidemic spread. For a sigmoidal adaptation, we identify conditions under which oscillations in prevalence can emerge, with peak prevalence exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the width of the sigmoidal function, suggesting an optimal parameter range that minimizes epidemic severity. We obtain prevalence, final epidemic size, and peak prevalence as functions of adaptation parameters in all adaptation scenarios considered, providing a comprehensive characterization of the effects of spatial adaptation based on global prevalence information in shaping adaptive epidemic dynamics.</p>

            <p>Magnetic levitation of superconductors is a promising platform to study quantum mechanics in the large-mass limit. One major limitation is the weak trapping potential, which results in low vibrational eigenfrequencies and increased susceptibility to low-frequency noise. While generating strong magnetic fields is relatively straightforward, creating a tightly confined harmonic potential - essentially achieving a large magnetic field gradient - remains a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a potential solution using superconducting cores that concentrate magnetic flux into arbitrarily small volumes. We show the ability to trap superconducting particles using an anti-Helmholtz coil configuration incorporating these cores. However, we observe rapid damping of the levitated particle motion due to flux trapping within the cores, occurring once the lower critical field is exceeded locally. To investigate this mechanism, we employ diamond NV center magnetometry and detect substantial remanent fields persisting after high-current operation of the coils. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to mitigate this effect and improve the levitation properties.</p>

            <p>Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.</p>

            <p>Hyperbolic phonon polaritons - hybridized modes arising from the ultrastrong coupling of infrared light to strongly anisotropic lattice vibrations in uniaxial or biaxial polar crystals - enable to confine light to the nanoscale with low losses and high directionality. In even lower symmetry materials, such as monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs) further enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only within narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host material. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic substitution. Employing near-field optical microscopy to image HShPs in $^{18}$O bGO films homo-epitaxially grown on a $^{16}$O bGO substrate, we demonstrate a spectral redshift of $\sim~40~$cm$^{-1}$ for the $^{18}$O bGO, compared to $^{16}$O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a model-free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution without the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary far-field measurements and ab initio calculations - in good agreement with the near-field data - confirm the effectiveness of this estimation. This multifaceted study demonstrates a significant isotopic substitution induced spectral tuning of HShPs into a previously inaccessible frequency range, creating new avenues for technological applications of such highly directional polaritons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-geun Oh, Sun-Woo Kim</p>
            <p>The optical properties of solids are governed not only by their energy band dispersions but also by the quantum geometry of Bloch states. While the role of energy bands in determining the perceived optical appearance of materials, such as color and transparency, is well established, the influence of quantum geometry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the color and transparency of materials can be direct manifestations of their underlying quantum geometry. To illustrate this principle, we employ quadratic band-touching models that allow us to tune only the geometric properties of Bloch states, while keeping the energy dispersion fixed. This decoupling reveals that modifying the wavefunction texture alone can lead to dramatic changes in the optical conductivity and, consequently, in the reflectance spectrum of the material. This results in distinct and controllable changes in perceived color. Similarly, we show that quantum geometry can govern the transparency of two-dimensional materials. Our findings demonstrate how quantum geometry shapes the visual appearance of materials, opening new avenues for tailoring color and transparency beyond traditional band structure design. This establishes quantum geometric engineering as a novel approach for manipulating materials with customized optical functionalities.</p>

            <p>Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has. While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized optical trapping fields.

            <h2>Target-density formation in swarms with stochastic sensing and dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Hindes, George Stantchev, Klimka Szwaykowska Kasraie, Ira B. Schwartz</p>
            <p>An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.</p>

            <h2>Planckian bound on quantum dynamical entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Cao</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Precision Ceiling in Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Hybrid Fourier-Neural Architecture for Ultra-High Accuracy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Shan Lee, Chi Kiu Althina Chau, Kei Chon Sio, Kam Ian Leong</p>
            <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and \(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery: exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing global challenge, with millions of functional components discarded due to the difficulty of repair and reuse. Traditional circuit assembly relies on soldering, which creates semi-permanent bonds that limit component recovery and contribute to unnecessary waste. We introduce ProForm, a thermoforming approach for solder-free circuit prototyping. By encapsulating electronic components with pressure-formed thermoplastics, ProForm enables secure, reversible mounting without the need for solder or custom mechanical housings. This approach supports a wide range of substrates, including flexible, paper-based, and non-planar circuits, facilitating easy reuse, replacement, and rapid prototyping. We demonstrate ProForm's versatility to support prototyping practices. We show that ProFormed circuits exhibit good electrical performance and mechanical stability. While motivated by a need for sustainable electronics practices, ProForm has other significant advantages over traditional soldering.</p>

            <p>We present a general and simple formula for computing the entanglement negativity in free fermions. Our formula allows for deriving several universal bounds on negativity and its rate of change in dynamics. The bound on negativity directly relates the clustering property of correlations in free-fermion states to the entanglement area law, and provides the optimal condition for the area law in mixed free fermion states with long-range correlations. In addition, we establish an area-law bound on entanglement generation in open systems, analogous to previously known results for entanglement entropy in unitary dynamics. Our work provides new analytical insights into fermionic mixed-state entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Walks on Arbitrary Spatial Networks with Rydberg Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Almeida, Raul Santos, Lara Janiurek, Yasser Omar</p>
            <p>Rydberg atoms provide a highly promising platform for quantum computation, leveraging their strong tunable interactions to encode and manipulate information in the electronic states of individual atoms. Key advantages of Rydberg atoms include scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and native multi-qubit gates, making them particularly well-suited for addressing complex network problems. These problems can often be framed as graph-based tasks, which can be efficiently addressed using quantum walks. In this work, we propose a general implementation of staggered quantum walks with Rydberg atoms, with a particular focus on spatial networks. We also present an efficient algorithm for constructing the tessellations required for the staggered quantum walk. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves quadratic speedup in spatial search algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann</p>
            <p>Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Fascinating in art and science, the ability to float is also captivating and relevant in practical applications, such as Penning and ion traps that are fundamental to quantum computing. In this work, we first reproduce the classic water bridge by glycerol and, as it breaks down due to thermal agitation, observe that a lump of glycerol with mass~2.5 g can float and exhibit near-periodic oscillations. Through experiments, finite element analysis, and simulations, we discover that the stability of the floating droplet is made possible by the interaction between three mechanisms: Deformation, Plasma, and Kelvin force. Note that glycerol cluster (GC) falls in the class of adaptive materials that can change their properties or behavior in response to varying environmental conditions, i.e., stimuli-responsive. Furthermore, the stimuli, modified by the deformation of GC, collaborate with it to create this unique simple, yet stable, floating system. Backed up by simulations, this process, operated by only a single pair of electrodes, holds the potential to develop a simple yet powerful railgun.</p>

            <p>Disorder and non-Hermitian effects together can upend how waves localize. In a 1D disordered chain, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can induce Anderson delocalization, defying the usual rule that disorder in low dimensions always localizes states. While weak disorder leaves the NHSE intact, strong disorder restores Anderson localization. Here, we study a surprising twist: coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorder anti-symmetrically correlated. Strikingly, once the inter-chain coupling exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes Anderson delocalization irrespective of disorder strength, reinstating the NHSE with no Hermitian counterpart. This transition arises from the interplay of non-reciprocal hopping, inter-chain coupling, and engineered disorder correlations, and is captured by a real-space winding number. To confirm this, we build an electrical-circuit analog and directly observe the re-emergent NHSE via voltage measurements. Our work uncovers unexplored and experimentally accessible physics at the crossroads of non-Hermiticity and disorder.</p>

            <p>The ultimate spatial limit to establish a Josephson coupling between two superconducting electrodes is an atomic-scale junction. The Josephson effect in such ultrasmall junctions has been used to unveil new switching dynamics, study coupling close to superconducting bound states or reveal non-reciprocal effects. However, the Josephson coupling is weak and the sensitivity to temperature reduces the Cooper pair current magnitude. Here we show that a feedback element induces a time-dependent bistable regime which consists of spontaneous periodic oscillations between two different Cooper pair tunneling states (corresponding to the DC and AC Josephson regimes respectively). The amplitude of the time-averaged current within the bistable regime is almost independent of temperature. By tracing the periodic oscillations in the new bistable regime as a function of the position in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope, we obtain atomic scale maps of the critical current in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and find spatial modulations due to a pair density wave. Our results fundamentally improve our understanding of atomic size Josephson junctions including a feedback element in the circuit and provide a promising new route to study superconducting materials through atomic scale maps of the Josephson coupling.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, and we show that autocorrelations can be systematically reduced by increasing numerical effort. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, in conjunction with QMC, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</p>

            <p>We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</p>

            <p>Dense particle-fluid mixtures, or \emph{pastes}, are encountered in the production of various materials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for bioenergy. The flow behavior of such dense deformable particulate media is poorly understood, as the interplay between applied stresses, particle deformability and interstitial fluids can be very complex. One challenging context is high pressure pipe flow, encountered in extrusion. Despite its widespread use, many questions remain about how during high pressure flow of the paste, the particle-fluid mixture behaves and interacts with boundaries. We show how high pressure paste extrusion induces the formation of a fluid boundary thinner than the particle size. The induced fluid layer emerges from a pressure-induced phase segregation process. The fluid layer is sufficiently thin to affect particle-wall contacts, making the paste friction coefficient tunable. Our results so offer potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and even extrusion product composition and failure.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently been shown to demonstrate non-volatile resistive switching (NVRS), offering significant advantages such as high-density integration and low energy consumption due to their atomic-scale thinness. In this study, we focus on the adsorption and desorption of metal adatoms, which can modulate the electrical resistivity by several orders of magnitude. We develop material-based relationships of the adsorption energy with electronic and atomic structure descriptors by examining the effects of various transition-metal adsorbates on the surface of TMDs. Our results reveal that adsorption energies of transition metals exhibit consistent trends across different TMDs (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$) and can be explained using simple descriptors of the atomic and electronic structure. We propose several models to describe this adsorption process, providing a deeper understanding of a crucial step in the resistive switching mechanism based on formation and dissolution of point defects. Finally, we connect our computed adsorption energies to the switching energy. These findings will help guide rational materials selection for the development of NVRS devices using 2D TMDs.</p>

Using a Fermi gas model, we calculate carrier concentration in across different dimensions and introduce the concept of quantum concentration $n_Q$ as a statistical threshold for quantum confinement effect. We further demonstrate that the electron degeneracy pressure -- scaling with $n^{(d+2)/d}$ -- provides a thermodynamic explanation for carrier enhancement under quantum confinement.

            <p>Single-crystalline diamond (SCD) films possess exceptional thermal, chemical, and optical properties, making them ideal for advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality via microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) remains challenging due to spatial variations in plasma characteristics. This study systematically examines the influence of microwave power and chamber pressure on the growth of SCD films using CH4/H2 gas mixtures. Under optimized conditions (3,900 W, 120 Torr), the films exhibit low surface roughness (~2.0 nm), a sharp sp3 Raman peak at 1,332.2 cm-1, and no detectable C-H related features, indicating high crystalline purity. Cross-sectional TEM analysis confirms a uniform (100)-oriented single-crystal structure across the entire sample. These findings advance the understanding of the interplay between deposition parameters and film quality, and establish a more robust foundation for optimizing MPCVD processes in large-area, high-purity diamond fabrication.</p>

            <p>The realization of fractional Chern insulators in moirÃ© materials has sparked the search for further novel phases of matter in this platform. In particular, recent works have demonstrated the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHCs), which combine the zero-field quantum Hall effect with spontaneously broken discrete translation symmetry. Here, we employ exact diagonalization to demonstrate the existence of stable QAHCs arising from $\frac{2}{3}$-filled moirÃ© bands with Chern number $C=2$. Our calculations show that these topological crystals, which are characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity of $1$ (in units of $e^2/h$) and a tripled unit cell, are robust in an ideal model of twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene -- providing a novel explanation for experimental observations in this heterostructure. Furthermore, we predict that the QAHC remains robust in a realistic model of twisted double bilayer graphene and, in addition, we provide a range of optimal tuning parameters, namely twist angle and electric field, for experimentally realizing this phase. Overall, our work demonstrates the stability of QAHCs at odd-denominator filling of $C=2$ bands, provides specific guidelines for future experiments, and establishes chiral multilayer graphene as a theoretical platform for studying topological phases beyond the Landau-level paradigm.</p>

            <p>Spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom that play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we combine these two crucial ingredients for the first time by proposing a completely new orbital optical Raman lattice scheme to explore exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which exhibits a global topological chiral orbital current characterized by a uniform Chern number, and the two-dimensional topological spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns and topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers, respectively protecting the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our scheme may open a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and is expected to advance the experimental realization of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zdzislaw Burda, Mario Kieburg</p>
            <p>We study the dynamical aspects of the top rank statistics of particles, performing Brownian motions on a half-line, which are ranked by their distance from the origin. For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the overlap ratio $\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle that is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after time $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-MÃ©zard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.</p>

            <p>The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm wide GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.</p>

            <h2>Exact solution to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type equation for quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Coppola</p>
            <p>The mean-state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local occupation number operators is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuum limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a kinetic equation for the Wigner function, which corresponds to a special case of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation without energy conservation. Our main result is the solution to the kinetic equation, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.</p>

            <p>We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra with scanning-laser-Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to $2\times10^5$ are found at room temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrquencies exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's modulus in agreement with literature. These findings are robust under post-processing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on the upcoming SiC platform.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kay Brandner, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.</p>

            <p>Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</p>

            <p>Orbitronics explores the control and manipulation of electronic orbital angular momentum in solid-state systems, opening new pathways for information processing and storage. One significant advantage of orbitronics over spintronics is that it does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, thereby broadening the range of non-magnetic materials that can be utilized for these applications. It also introduces new topological features related to electronic orbital angular momentum, and clarifies some long-standing challenges in understanding experiments that rely on the conventional concept of valley transport. This review highlights recent advances in orbitronics, particularly in relation to two-dimensional materials. We examine the fundamental principles underlying the generation, transport, and dynamics of orbital angular momentum to illustrate how the unique properties of two-dimensional materials can promote orbitronic phenomena. We also outline potential future research directions and address some outstanding questions in this field.</p>

            <p>As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal is necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches for certain measurements. Simultaneous sampling of the lattice across all basis indices also warrants a coherent treatment of phonons, which yields a larger repeating unit in reciprocal space. We thus introduce the concept of the ``interferometric Brillouin zone'', which is closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor. Both effects determine where phonon modes may be observed. Through a rigorous understanding of both, we introduce a new efficient method of simulation of scattering experiments via Spectral Energy Density (SED) and/or Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective vibrational density of states.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical response theory of interacting Majorana fermions and its application to generic Kitaev quantum spin liquids in a field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Rao, Roderich Moessner, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Motivated by the appearance of Majorana fermions in a broad range of correlated and topological electronic systems, we develop a general method to compute the dynamical response of interacting Majorana fermions in the random-phase approximation (RPA). This can be applied self-consistently on top of Majorana mean-field theory (MFT) backgrounds, thereby in particular providing a powerful tool to analyse $\textit{generic}$ behaviour in the vicinity of (various heavily studied) exactly soluble models. Prime examples are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with emergent Majorana excitations, with the celebrated exact solution of Kitaev. We employ the RPA to study in considerable detail phase structure and dynamics of the extended Kitaev honeycomb $KJ\Gamma$-model, with and without an applied field. First, we benchmark our method with Kitaev's exactly soluble model, finding a remarkable agreement. The interactions between Majorana fermions even turn out to mimic the effect of local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations, which we explain analytically. Second, we show how small non-Kitaev couplings $J$ and $\Gamma$ induce Majorana bound states, resulting in sharp features in the dynamical structure factor in the presence of fractionalisation: such 'spinon excitons' naturally appear, and can coexist and interact with the broad Majorana continuum. Third, for increasing couplings or field, our theory predicts instabilities of the KQSL triggered by the condensation of the sharp modes. From the high symmetry momenta of the condensation we can deduce which magnetically ordered phases surround the KQSL, in good agreement with previous finite-size numerics. We discuss implications for experiments and the broad range of applicability of our method to other QSL and Majorana systems.</p>

            <p>Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Voss, Uwe Thiele</p>
            <p>We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemo-mechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemo-mechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.</p>

            <p>Pellet manufacturing of biomass (food, feed, bioenergy) presses powders or particles into dense pellets with improved nutritional, calorific, and handling properties. This process upgrades industrial co-products from agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy into higher-value products. However, processing particulate streams raises the scientific question: Under which conditions do loose particles bind to form rigid, durable pellets? This work answers this question for biomass extrusion. Systematic experiments reveal how steam conditioning temperature, production rate, and die geometry interact to determine pellet quality. We propose an overarching framework introducing the stickiness temperature ($T^*$), marking the onset of enthalpic reactions required for particle agglomeration. $T^*$ serves as the boundary for inter-particle bond formation and is reached through a combination of steam conditioning and friction, both controllable via process parameters. Results highlight the combined role of pellet temperature and die residence time in optimizing pellet durability while lowering specific energy use (J/kg). Validation with experiments and literature confirms that this framework offers practical guidance to enhance efficiency and sustainability of pelleting. By providing operational parameters to control bonding and energy input, this work supports a more circular economy through efficient conversion of diverse biomass streams into valuable products while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

            <h2>Evanescent Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics Without Spin-Orbit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengyuan Cai, Hanchen Wang, Tao Yu</p>
            <p>Converting magnetization spin to orbital current often relies on strong spin-orbit interaction that may cause additional angular momentum dissipation. We report that coherent magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures can evanescently pump an orbital current into adjacent semiconductors due to the coupling between its stray electromagnetic field and electron orbitals without relying on spin-orbit coupling. The underlying photonic spin of the electromagnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient of the driven field. Due to the orbital texture, the orbital Hall current that flows perpendicularly to the gradient of the AC field is also generated and does not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of orbital pumping to include photonic spin and pave the way for developing low-dissipation orbitronic devices.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</p>

            <h2>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Kishigi, Yasumasa Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-Han Zhou, Xiyin Ye, Tao Yu</p>
            <p>We report a non-contact mechanism for directional injection of magnons in magnetic films when driven by a spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$ of electrons of a nearby metallic layer, governed by the long-range dipolar coupling between magnons and electron spins, which spontaneously generates a magnon current ${\bf J}_m$ flowing in the film plane. Crucially, in such near-field radiative spin transfer, the magnon flow ${\bf J}_m$ is always perpendicular to the spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$, showing a universal chiral locking relation. The spin injection is efficient even when $\pmb{\mu}_s$ is parallel to the magnetization, a feature breaking the limitation of the spin transfer by contact exchange interaction. Our findings reveal the critical role of dipolar chirality in driving the magnon thermal current and paving the way for the functional design of magnonic devices based on near-field radiative spin transfer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunihiro Yananose, Changwon Park, Young-Woo Son</p>
            <p>At very small twist angles, bilayer moirÃ© systems exhibit characteristic stacking domain patterns, where the moirÃ© length scale is determined solely by the twist angle. In contrast, the additional stacking and twisting degrees of freedom in twisted trilayer systems give rise to richer and more intricate domain tessellations. In twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride (TTBN), the interplay between polar and nonpolar domains and their domain walls is shown to result in unconventional responses to external electric fields, including electric-field tunability of the moirÃ©-of-moirÃ© or super moirÃ© pattern - features absent in bilayer counterparts. We demonstrate that at the vertices of super moirÃ© domains, TTBN can support arrays of quantum dots hosting localized quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) states with diverse spatial symmetries. Futhermore, we show that the shape of the array and the spacing between the localized QHO states can be dynamically reconfigured by electric fields, enabling facile switching between fully isolated and strongly coupled regimes. The local potentials for the quantum dot state are predicted to be sufficiently deep to support a series of QHO states with nonzero angular momentum. This tunability enables control over the transport of quantum dot states and their inter-dot coupling, facillitating long-range quantum state transfer. Combined with the feasibility of large-scale fabrication of homogeneous twisted trilayer materials, these properties position TTBN as a promising platform for a wide range of quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies. However, automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts - like ring and cupping effects - and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through a metal oxide dissolution study. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves segmentation performance (94.7% IoU) that matches human inter-annotator reliability (94.6% IoU). This indicates the model has reached the practical upper bound for this task, while reducing processing time by 2 orders of magnitude per 3D dataset compared to manual segmentation. The method maintains robust performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, enabling the efficient analysis of the large volumes of time-resolved tomographic data generated in typical in situ experiments across scientific disciplines.</p>

            <p>La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of tetravalent substituents for trivalent La. Here, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen, which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provide theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</p>

            <p>Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</p>

            <p>Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.</p>

We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnets are of significant interest both as a platform for exploring novel fundamental physics and for their potential in spintronic and optoelectronic devices. Recent bulk magnetometry studies have indicated a weak ferromagnetic response in WS2, and theoretical predictions suggest edge-localized magnetization in flakes with partial hydrogenation. Here, we use room-temperature wide-field quantum diamond magnetometry to image pristine and Fe-implanted WS2 flakes of varying thicknesses (45-160 nm), exfoliated from bulk crystals and transferred to NV-doped diamond substrates. We observe direct evidence of edge-localized stray magnetic fields, which scale linearly with applied external magnetic field (4.4-220 mT), reaching up to 4.7 uT. The edge signal shows a limited dependence on the flake thickness, consistent with dipolar field decay and sensing geometry. Magnetic simulations using five alternative models favor the presence of edge magnetization aligned along an axis slightly tilted from the normal to the WS2 flake plane, consistent with spin canting in antiferromagnetically coupled edge states. Our findings establish WS2 as a promising platform for edge-controlled 2D spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Higher order Jacobi method for solving system of linear equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nithin Kumar Goona, Lama Tarsissi</p>
            <p>This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi iterative method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher order Jacobi method (HOJM), structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that allows efficient resolution of system variations without recomputing the coefficients, once the network parameters are trained for a known system. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach goes beyond conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis on GPU reveals significant enhancement in the order of complexity, highlighting a compelling and transformative direction for advancing algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ni Zhan, William A. Wheeler, Gil Goldshlager, Elif Ertekin, Ryan P. Adams, Lucas K. Wagner</p>
            <p>Neural network wave functions have shown promise as a way to achieve high accuracy on the many-body quantum problem. These wave functions most commonly use a determinant or sum of determinants to antisymmetrize many-body orbitals which are described by a neural network. In many cases, the wave function is projected onto a fixed-spin state. Such a treatment is allowed for spin-independent operators; however, it cannot be applied to spin-dependent problems, such as Hamiltonians containing spin-orbit interactions. We show that for spin-independent Hamiltonians, a strict upper bound property is obeyed between a traditional Hartree-Fock like determinant, full spinor wave function, the full determinant wave function, and a generalized spinor wave function. The relationship between a spinor wave function and the full determinant arises because the full determinant wave function is the spinor wave function projected onto a fixed-spin, after which antisymmetry is implicitly restored in the spin-independent case. For spin-dependent Hamiltonians, the full determinant wave function is not applicable, because it is not antisymmetric. Numerical experiments on the H$_3$ molecule and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas confirm the bounds.</p>

            <h2>Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb</p>
            <p>Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which treats $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over molecular orientations. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus anisotropic interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring anisotropic interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interaction anisotropy influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</p>

            <h2>Hetero-Orbital Two-Component Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer Graphene</h2>

            <p>A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo Fradkin</p>
            <p>Complex phase diagrams are generic feature of quantum materials that display high temperature superconductivity. In addition to d-wave superconductivity (or other unconventional states), these phase diagrams typically include various forms of charge-ordered phases, including charge-density-waves and/or spin-density waves, and electronic nematic states. In most cases these phases have critical temperatures comparable in magnitude to that of the superconducting state, and appear in a "pseudo-gap" regime. In these systems the high temperature state is not a good metal with well-defined quasiparticles but a "strange metal". These states typically arise from doping a strongly correlated Mott insulator. With my collaborators we have identified these behaviors as a problem with "Intertwined Orders". A Pair-density wave is a type of superconducting state which embodies the physics of intertwined orders. Here I discus the phenomenology of intertwined orders and the quantum materials that are known to display these behaviors.</p>

            <h2>"Depletion" of Superfluid Density: Universal Low-temperature Thermodynamics of Superfluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor Berger, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov</p>
            <p>Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with anharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature ($T$) dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size ($L$) corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids with an intrinsic connection between finite-$T$ and finite-$L$ effects implying universal scaling, $T^{d+1}$ and $1/L^{d+1}$, respectively, for a large class of thermodynamic quantities.</p>

            <p>It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this Letter, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples-- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on comb lattice -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. In addition to the long range order parameter, its energy spectrum shows Anderson tower of states. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salvatore D. Pace, Ãmer M. Aksoy, Ho Tat Lam</p>
            <p>We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.</p>

            <h2>Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel</p>
            <p>Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable periodic potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave superconductor and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose energies differ by less than $1\%$. These two competing states mirror the superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed experimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic Coulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cody D. Schimming</p>
            <p>Periodic boundary conditions are a common theoretical and computational tool used to emulate effectively infinite domains. However, two-dimensional periodic domains are topologically distinct from the infinite plane, eliciting the question: How do periodic boundaries affect systems with topological properties themselves? In this work, I derive an analytical expression for the orientation fields of two-dimensional $p$-atic liquid crystals, systems with $p$-fold rotational symmetry, with topological defects in a flat domain subject to periodic boundary conditions. I show that this orientation field leads to an anomalous interaction between defects that deviates from the usual Coulomb interaction, which is confirmed through continuum simulations of nematic liquid crystals ($p = 2$). The interaction is understood as being mediated by non-singular topological solitons in the director field which are stabilized by the periodic boundary conditions. The results show the importance of considering domain topology, not only geometry, when analyzing interactions between topological defects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irakli Titvinidze, Julian Stobbe, Marvin Leusch, Georg Rohringer</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott metal-to-insulator transition. At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value, charge fluctuations eventually become larger in D$\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.</p>

            <p>Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-PÃ©rot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates as photocatalytic materials due to their large surface areas and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daigo Oue, MÃ¡rio G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</p>

            <p>Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moirÃ© periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moirÃ© trion band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator remains robust.

            <p>Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field, a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field, and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast, adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.</p>

Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency modes.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Theory of Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leiming Chen, Chiu Fan Lee, John Toner</p>
            <p>We study the hydrodynamic behavior of two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. We show that, in the absence of fluctuations, such systems generically form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity of the entire system rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency b. Fluctuations about this state belong to the universality class of (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order in the hydrodynamic limit. We then show that, in the limit of weak chirality, the hydrodynamics of a system with reasonable size is expected to governed by the linear regime of the KPZ equation, exhibiting quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for the velocity and number density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> RÃ©mi Goerlich, Kristian StÃ¸levik Olsen, Hartmut LÃ¶wen, Yael Roichman</p>
            <p>Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.</p>

            <h2>The gauge theory dual of the bilayer XY model with second order Josephson coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pye Ton How, Sungkit Yip</p>
            <p>We formulate a duality transformation for a bilayer XY model where the layers are coupled by second order Josephson effect, which favors inter-layer phase difference of either $0$ or $\pi$. The model may represent a bilayer superconductor or a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose gas in the easy-plane limit. The second order Josephson term is mapped to a U(1) gauge field, known to be trivially confining in two dimensions, and we argue that a Coulomb-gas analysis is not applicable to the dual theory. Instead, we appeal to the vast knowledge of gauge theory and infer that the only phase transition out of low-temperature ordered phase is an Ising transition driven by condensation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ domain wall loops. The domain wall loops can be seen as a surviving vestige of single-layer vortex-anti-vortex pair, heavily deformed by the second order Josephson coupling. A theoretical or computational method that concentrates on point defects would most likely miss out on these excitations and reach erroneous results. Our dual theory offers a clear, intuitive picture of how the second order Josephson coupling induces confinement of vortices and drastically changes the physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>Exotic entanglement entropy scaling properties usually come with interesting entanglement structures in real space and novel metrics of the spacetime lattice. One prominent example is the rainbow chain where lattice sites symmetric about the center form entangled Bell pairs due to an effective long-range coupling from the strong inhomogeneity of the coupling strength. This manuscript generalizes the rainbow chain to higher dimensional space on lattices with Hausdorff dimension one and enlarged local Hilbert space keeping the Hamiltonian frustration free. The effective Hamiltonian from the Schrieffer-Wolf transformation is given by a stacking of layers of $k$-simplices with $0$-dimensional (fully-connected) antiferromagnetic Hamiltonians, which can be diagonalized analytically with Young operators. The original lattice can be obtained from proliferating disinclination defects in a regular $k$-dimensional cubical lattice, which introduces curvature at the center of the lattice. The model interpolates between the SYK model and the free-fermionic XX spin chain, and hence might be potentially useful in understanding black hole physics and holography.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Quantum Markov Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ao Chen, Chengkai Zhu, Keming He, Mingrui Jing, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed A. Akhtar, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.</p>

            <h2>Non-stabilizerness in kinetically-constrained Rydberg atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Smith, Zlatko PapiÄ, Andrew Hallam</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</p>

The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of SchrÃ¶dinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Quantum field theories with quenched disorder are so hard to study that even exactly solvable free theories present puzzling aspects. We consider a free scalar field $\phi$ in $d$ dimensions coupled to a random source $h$ with quenched disorder. Despite the presence of a mass scale governing the disorder distribution, we derive a new description of the theory that allows us to show that the theory is gapless and invariant under conformal symmetry, which acts in a non-trivial way on $\phi$ and $h$. This manifest CFT description reveals the presence of exotic continuous symmetries, such as nilpotent bosonic ones, in the quenched theory. We also reconsider Cardy's CFT description defined through the replica trick. In this description, the nilpotent symmetries reveal a striking resemblance with Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetries. We provide explicit maps of correlation functions between such CFTs and the original quenched theory. The maps are non-trivial and show that conformal behaviour is manifest only when considering suitable linear combinations of averages of products of correlators. We also briefly discuss how familiar notions like normal ordering of composite operators and OPE can be generalized in the presence of the more complicated local observables in the quenched theory.</p>

            <p>Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.</p>

            <p>The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</p>

The model is motivated by quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms in tweezers or trapped ions. The configuration of two domain walls simulates the particle-antiparticle connecting string. We concentrate on the effect the local vibrations have on the dynamics of this initial state. Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</p>

            <p>First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</p>

            <p>In contrast to conventional artificial neural networks, which are structurally static, we present two approaches for evolving small networks into larger ones during training. The first method employs an auxiliary weight that directly controls network size, while the second uses a controller-generated mask to modulate neuron participation. Both approaches optimize network size through the same gradient-descent algorithm that updates the network's weights and biases. We evaluate these growing networks on nonlinear regression and classification tasks, where they consistently outperform static networks of equivalent final size. We then explore the hyperparameter space of these networks to find associated scaling relations relative to their static counterparts. Our results suggest that starting small and growing naturally may be preferable to simply starting large, particularly as neural networks continue to grow in size and energy consumption.</p>

Our construction includes the fermionic generalization of code CFTs. When the Chern-Simons theory is associated with the root lattice of a simply laced Lie algebra, this approach yields a fermionic CFT with a level-one affine Lie algebra symmetry. As an application, we consider the Chern-Simons theories corresponding to a class of supersymmetric vertex operator algebras studied by Johnson-Freyd and classify their fermionic topological boundary conditions that give rise to supersymmetric CFTs.</p>

            <p>Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers), when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a compelling and scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms applied to 3D spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT). We benchmark these methods against the performance of a leading quantum annealer on the same problem instances. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, in line with expectations from extreme value theory. We then show that APT, when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, exhibits a more favorable scaling and ultimately outperforms DT-SQA. We demonstrate these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware, projecting that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips can leverage massive parallelism to accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a new, rigorous classical baseline, clarifying the landscape for assessing a practical quantum advantage and presenting p-computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.</p>

            <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning.

By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nlane-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nlane-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through the SIE4x4 benchmark and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</p>

            <p>The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. This study investigates strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO$_2$/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of $\approx$0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of $\approx$0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <h2>Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isaac Layton, Harry J. D. Miller</p>
            <p>All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. Haashir Ismail, M. Mufassir</p>
            <p>Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</p>

            <p>Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a planar gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</p>

            <p>We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.</p>

            <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a foundational tool in the physical and life sciences, yet conventional implementations are typically limited to macroscopic spatial resolution. Here, we introduce a method for nanoscale MRI by combining strong, time-dependent magnetic field gradients with global coherent control over a dense ensemble of electron spins in diamond. This approach enables spatially structured manipulation of spin dynamics, allowing us to generate and track nanoscale spin textures - patterns of spin polarization - that evolve under engineered many-body dipolar interactions. By tuning the rotational symmetry of the dipolar exchange interactions, we observe pronounced sensitivity of the spin dynamics to the microscopic structure of the polarization, which we resolve through nanoscale MRI. Our results open the door for robust control of metrologically useful entanglement and nanoscale imaging of materials and biological systems under ambient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aswathy K R, Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</p>

            <p>We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel circuits.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaewon Shim (Seoul National University), Manhee Lee (Chungbuk National University), Wonho Jhe (Seoul National University)</p>
            <p>The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</p>

            <p>Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</p>

            <h2>SETOL: A Semi-Empirical Theory of (Deep) Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles H Martin, Christopher Hinrichs</p>
            <p>We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry. The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning, including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models, we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.</p>

            <h2>Non-ideal subthreshold swing in aligned carbon nanotube transistors due to variable occupancy discrete charge traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurabh S. Sawant, Teo Lara, Francois Leonard, Zhi Yao, Andrew Nonaka</p>
            <p>Carbon nanotube transistors have been experimentally demonstrated to reach performance comparable and even surpassing that of silicon transistors. Further improvement requires addressing non-idealities arising from device fabrication that impact performance and reproducibility. One performance metric that determines energy efficiency is the subthreshold swing which is often observed to be 3-4 times larger than the ideal thermal limit. In this work, we present simulations indicating that a discrete number of variable occupancy hole trapping sites can explain the large subthreshold swing. Our simulations indicate that while three-dimensional trap distributions influence the subthreshold swing, only the traps in close proximity to the nanotubes have a significant impact. The results suggest that a density of trapping sites on the order of 0.5/nm$^2$ near the nanotubes is sufficient to significantly increase the subthreshold swing, requiring the removal or passivation of only a few sites per carbon nanotube.</p>

This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU) resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.</p>

            <p>Despite its tiny net magnetization, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) van der Waals material Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ exhibits a large transverse Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ even at zero applied magnetic field, which arises, as recently shown, from the topological nature of its non-coplanar ``tetrahedral'' AFM order. This triple-Q magnetic order can be regarded as the short-lengthscale limit of a magnetic skyrmion lattice, and has an intrinsic spin chirality. Here we show, using optical wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to infrared (400-1000 nm), that magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provides an incisive optical probe of the topological AFM order in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Measurements as a continuous function of photon energy are directly compared with first-principles calculations, revealing the influence of the underlying quantum geometry on optical conductivity. Leveraging the power and flexibility of optical methods, we use scanning MCD microscopy to directly image chiral AFM domains, and demonstrate writing of chiral AFM domains.</p>

Using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction imaging (XDI) at the upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS-U), we spatially resolved micron-scale distributions of these phases, revealing structural inhomogeneity across the sample. Four-probe DC resistance measurements confirmed superconductivity, with two distinct transitions: an onset at 244 K associated with the cubic phase and a second near 220 K linked to the hexagonal phase. Notably, resistance profiles collected from different current and voltage permutations showed variations in transition width and onset temperature that correlated with the spatial phase distribution mapped by XDI. These findings demonstrate a direct connection between local structural domains and superconducting behavior. Yttrium substitution is found to influence both the phase behavior and superconducting properties of LaH10-type clathrate hydrides. More broadly, this study highlights the utility of spatially correlating structural and electrical transport measurements in materials exhibiting heterogeneity under pressure, including hydride superconductors.</p>

            <p>Quantum droplets are dilute self-bound configurations of bosons that result from the balance between a mean-field attraction and a repulsion induced by quantum fluctuations. Such droplets have been successfully realized in cold atomic gases and represent a signature of their quantum nature. Here, we predict the existence of a similar droplet phase in a solid-state system, involving polaritons formed from the strong coupling between excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. We consider a spin mixture of exciton-polaritons near a biexciton Feshbach resonance, which allows one to tune the interspecies interactions to be attractive and comparable in magnitude to the intraspecies repulsion. We find that self-bound quantum droplets are achievable for realistic parameters in atomically thin semiconductors, and that they can be detected via their excitation spectrum and spatial profile. This exotic phase could potentially lead to polariton condensation at lower thresholds and it opens an alternative avenue to achieve the long-sought quantum polaritonic regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anu Koviloor Manian, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni</p>
            <p>Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant interest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic responses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions. Importantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and non-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel approach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise to tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic optical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such as electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC environment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon interactions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields, directly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of exciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting energy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC orientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at zero delay yields \( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \), demonstrating photon anti-bunching, confirming the quantum nature of emission. Our findings establish a versatile platform where TMDCs and LCs synergistically enable electrically controllable strong coupling, offering a scalable and responsive architecture for next-generation quantum photonic devices.</p>

            <p>The ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6 has attracted vast attention, because its pristine Mn kagome lattice with strong spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane Tb-Mn exchange supports quantum-limit Chern topological magnetism which can be described by the simple spinless Haldane model. We unveil herein that engineering the kagome lattice through partial substitution of Mn with nonmagnetic Cr induces a striking structural reorganization-Cr preferentially concentrates within a single Mn layer per unit cell, reducing the crystal symmetry from the D6h point group to the C2. This tailored structure configuration gives rise to a plateau-like topological Hall effect (THE), achieving a record-breaking resistivity of 19.1 ohm cm among bulk systems. Complementary magnetic force microscopy measurements unveil a magnetic domain transition near 1 T at 180 K, aligning with the field-dependent phase diagram of the THE. Our direct visualization of the magnetic domain structure underscores the critical role of broken kagome lattice symmetry in generating distinct exchange stiffness between the two Mn layers. These findings establish a new paradigm for exploring exotic states in kagome topological magnets and provide a proof-of-principle strategy for unraveling the interplay between magnetism and emergent topological properties in kagome systems.</p>

            <p>The magnetization dynamics driven by the femtosecond laser pulse of antiferromagnet van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr is studied within time-dependent density functional theory. We investigate the effect of laser fluence as well as the excitation frequency on the ultrafast dynamics of spins. In low fluence, the local magnetic moment of Cr increases when the laser frequency is below the band gap, whereas it decreases when the laser frequency is above the band gap. In high fluence, we find strong demagnetization independent of excitation frequency. We find that the ultrafast demagnetization in CrSBr is dominated by intralayer and interlayer optical intersite spin transfer, and spin flip via the spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role. Our results reveal hole excitation in the low-fluence regime and electron excitation in the high-fluence regime. Further, we investigate the effect of the external static magnetic field on the dynamics. We demonstrate even and odd high harmonic generation in the local magnetic moments and electric current, respectively. The external magnetic field results in an out-of-plane charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect as well as odd harmonics in the local magnetic moment dynamics as a result of breaking the time-reversal symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeraj Rajan Warrier, Jayasri Dontabhaktuni</p>
            <p>The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by 10X and a decrease in data requirements by 40X when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity in relation to the target absorption spectra compared to the classical GAN based methods. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.</p>

            <p>We identify {\em injection} and {\em shift} rectified Raman forces, which are phononic counterparts of the photogalvanic effect, that drive lattice vibrations and trigger transient emergent properties. These forces are governed by the {\em quantum geometric tensor}, a {\em phononic shift vector}, and interband asymmetries in the electron-phonon coupling. The injection force acts displacively, while -- unlike conventional impulsive mechanisms -- the shift force emerges impulsively in the resonant interband absorbing regime when time-reversal symmetry is broken. Using the bilayer Haldane model, we quantify the injection and shift forces acting on interlayer shear phonons through both analytical and numerical methods. Strikingly, we reveal strong tunability, both in magnitude and direction, of the rectified forces by varying the driving frequency and magnetic flux, uncovering a distinct quantum geometric mechanism for ultrafast and coherent manipulation of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have extremely short, picosecond-scale lifetimes which hinders exciton thermalization, limits the emergence of collective coherence, and reduces exciton transport in optoelectronic devices. In this work, we explore an all-optical pathway to extend exciton lifetimes by placing MoSe$_2$ in a deep-subwavelength Fabry-Perot silver cavity. The cavity structure is designed to suppress radiative recombination from in-plane optical dipoles, such as bright excitons and trions. We observe a consistent decrease in photoluminescence (PL) linewidths of excitons and trions (~1 nm), along with a corresponding lifetime increase (~10 ps). We confirm the experimental observations arise purely from exciton-cavity interactions-etching back the top silver layer returns the PL linewidth and lifetimes return to their original values. Our study offers a pathway to engineer excited state lifetimes in 2D materials which can be utilized for studies of optically dark excitons and have potential applications for novel optoelectronic devices.</p>

However, computing electronic and optical properties of such systems using state-of-the-art methodology is challenging due to their large unit cells. This is in particular so for highly-precise all-electron calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which come with high computational costs. Here, we extend an approach that allows for the efficient calculation of the non-interacting polarizability, previously developed for planewave basis sets, to the (linearized) augmented planewave (L)APW method. This approach is based on an additive ansatz, which computes and superposes the polarizabilities of the individual components in their respective unit cells. We implement this formalism in the $G_0W_0$ module of the exciting code and implement an analogous approach for BSE calculations. This allows the calculation of highly-precise optical spectra at low cost. So-obtained results of the quasi-particle band structure and optical spectra are demonstrated for bilayer WSe$_2$ and pyridine@MoS$_2$ in comparison with exact reference calculations.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-plane ferroelectricity, magnetoelectric coupling and persistent spin texture in two-dimensional multiferroics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhou, Cheng-Ao Ji, Shuai Dong, Xuezeng Lu</p>
            <p>Two dimensional multiferroics with out of plane ferroelectricity hold significant promise for miniaturized magnetoelectric spin-orbit transistors, yet systems combining robust ferroelectricity and strong magnetoelectric coupling are exceedingly rare. Here, we demonstrate that epitaxial strain stabilizes out of plane ferroelectricity in exfoliated two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper derivatives. The hybrid improper ferroelectric Pc phase transitions to a competing P21 phase with purely in plane polarization upon switching, accompanied by a 90 degree rotation of weak ferromagnetism. Crucially, the Pc phase exhibits altermagnetism, while P21 displays full Brillouin zone band splitting, with persistent spin textures rotating 90 degree at the phase boundary. This work establishes a pathway to engineer two dimensional multiferroics that integrate vertical polarization, magnetoelectric coupling, and switchable spin textures, key features for next generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Kibble-Zurek Behavior across Topological Transitions of a Chern Band in Ultracold Atoms</h2>

            <p>The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism renders a theoretical framework for elucidating the formation of topological defects across continuous phase transitions. Nevertheless, it is not immediately clear whether the KZ mechanism applies to topological phase transitions. The direct experimental study for such a topic is hindered by quenching a certain parameter over orders of magnitude in topological materials. Instead, we investigate the KZ behavior across topological transitions of a Chern band in two-dimensional (2D) optical Raman lattices with quantum gases. Defined as the defects, excitation density is reconstructed via measuring the spin wave functions, with which the power-law scaling of total excitation density is extracted and such scaling could be interpreted within the KZ framework. Our work has heralded the commencement of experimentally exploring the KZ mechanism of the topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped SmNiO$_2$, exhibiting the record-high transition temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, has opened a new avenue for exploring design principles of superconductivity. Experimentally determining the electronic structure and magnetic interactions in this new system is crucial to elucidating the mechanism behind the enhanced superconductivity. Here, we report a Ni $L$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of superconducting Sm-based IL nickelate thin films Sm$_{1-x-y-z}$Eu$_x$Ca$_y$Sr$_z$NiO$_2$ (SECS). Dispersive paramagnonic excitations are observed in both optimally and overdoped SECS samples, supporting a spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenario. However, despite the two-fold enhancement of $T_c$ in the Sm-based nickelates compared to their Pr-based counterparts, the effective exchange coupling strength is reduced by approximately $20\%$. This behavior contrasts with hole-doped cuprates, where magnetic interactions correlate positively with $T_c$, highlighting essential differences in their superconducting mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>2D ferroelectricity accompanying antiferro-orbital order in semi-metallic WTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangyuan Gu, Ruoshi Jiang, Wei Ku</p>
            <p>The first switchable electric polarization in metals was recently discovered in bilayer and trilayer WTe2. Strangely, despite the tininess of the ordered polarization, the ferroelectricity survives up to 350 K, rendering the mechanism of such ferroelectricity challenging for standard understandings. Here, via a density-functional-based multi-energy-scale analysis of the system's broken symmetries, we identify a weak out-of-plane ferroelectricity accompanying a strong in-plane antiferro-orbital order. This unusual low-energy correlation, which emerges from an antiferroelectric structure formed at much higher energy, naturally explains the above puzzling observation. This result reveals an unprecedented paradigm of electronic ferroelectricity generally applicable to 2D polar metals with ultrafast-switchable polarization ideal for the next-generation non-volatile memory and other devices.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry driven spin anisotropic magnetotransport in quantum spin Hall insulator WTe2 1T</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrushti Tapar, Bent Weber, Saroj P Dash, 3 Shantanu Mukherjee, Bhaskaran Muralidharan</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive magnetotransport analysis of monolayer 1T WTe2, highlighting the role of nonsymmorphic symmetries in governing edge-state spin behavior. By comparing the electronic transmission in nanoribbons with edges along the crystallographic y and x directions, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in the magnetic field response. The y-edge ribbon exhibits significant spin splitting of edge-state bands in both energy and momentum space, along with a strong angular dependence of the conductance. The observed magnetotransport response indicates a spin quantization axis that aligns with the out-of-plane spin quantization axis reported in previous experimental studies. In contrast, the x edge ribbon shows negligible spin splitting under magnetic fields, which is attributed to nonsymmorphic symmetries such as glide mirror and screw rotation, that protects degeneracies along the Gamma X direction, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken. The energy-resolved current density and angular transmission analyses confirm that this anisotropy originates from edge states, while bulk states remain largely insensitive to the field orientation. Our results establish direct transport-spectroscopy based evidence of nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected spin degeneracy in the 1T WTe2, and underscores its promise for spintronic devices that leverage symmetry-protected and directionally selective transport channels.</p>

            <h2>Variational Monte Carlo Optimization of Topological Chiral Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minho Luke Kim, Abigail Timmel, Xiao-Gang Wen</p>
            <p>We perform the variational Monte Carlo calculation for recently proposed chiral superconducting states driven by strong Coulomb interactions. We compare the resulting energetics of these electronic phases for the electron dispersion relation $E_k = c_2 k^2+c_4 k^4$. Motivated by the recent discovery of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene systems, we apply our analysis to relevant parameter regimes. We demonstrate that topological chiral superconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be energetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the density of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for chiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a negative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket around $k=0$. This finding suggests that superconductivity can arise from pure repulsive Coulomb interactions in systems with an almost flat band bottom, without relying on the pairing instability of a Fermi surface. This mechanism opens a new pathway to superconductivity beyond the conventional BCS mechanism.</p>

            <p>We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a magnetic quantum ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux, in the presence of a side-coupled one-dimensional non-magnetic chain. The neighboring magnetic moments in the ring are arranged in an antiparallel configuration. In the absence of the chain, the spin circular current vanishes exactly due to the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians. Modeling the system within a tight-binding framework, we compute the currents using a second-quantized approach. Both charge and spin currents can be selectively tuned by adjusting the ring-chain coupling strength. Temperature plays a crucial role in modulating the currents, and interestingly, we find that they increase significantly with rising temperature--contrary to conventional expectations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Since their prediction by Einstein at the dawn of quantum mechanics, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), owing to their property to show quantum phenomena on macroscopic scales, are drawing increasing attention across various fields in physics. They are the subject of many fascinating observations in various physical systems, from liquid helium to diluted atomic gases. In addition to real particles like atoms and composite bosons such as Cooper pairs or excitons, this phenomenon is also observed in gases of quasiparticles such as polaritons and magnons - quanta of spin-wave excitations in magnetic media. The fundamental property of the BEC state is its coherence, which is represented by a precisely defined phase of the corresponding wave function, which arises spontaneously and encompasses all particles gathered at the bottom of their spectrum. Until now, the BEC phase was only revealed in phenomena depending on the spatial phase difference, such as interference, second order coherence, and macroscopic BEC motions - supercurrents, superfluidity and Josephson oscillations. Here, we present a method for the direct time-domain measurement of the magnon BEC coherent state phase relative to an outside reference signal. We report the emergence of spontaneous coherence from a freely evolving magnon gas, which manifests as the condensation of magnons into a uniform precession state with minimal energy and a well-defined phase. These findings confirm all postulated fundamental properties of quasiparticle condensates, provide access to a new degree of freedom in such systems, and open up the possibility of information processing using microwave-frequency magnon BECs.</p>

            <h2>Modifying electronic and structural properties of 2D van der Waals materials via cavity quantum vacuum fluctuations: A first-principles QEDFT study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Liu, Simone Latini, I-Te Lu, Dongbin Shin, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Structuring the photon density of states and light-matter coupling in optical cavities has emerged as a promising approach to modifying the equilibrium properties of materials through strong light-matter interactions. In this article, we employ state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) to study the modifications of the electronic and structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials by the cavity vacuum field fluctuations. We find that cavity photons modify the electronic density through localization along the photon polarization directions, a universal effect observed for all the 2D materials studied here. This modification of the electronic structure tunes the material properties, such as the shifting of energy valleys in monolayer h-BN and 2H-MoS$_2$, enabling tunable band gaps. Also, it tunes the interlayer spacing in bilayer 2H-MoS$_2$ and T$_\text{d}$-MoTe$_2$, allowing for adjustable ferroelectric, nonlinear Hall effect, and optical properties, as a function of light-matter coupling strength. Our findings open an avenue for engineering a broad range of 2D layered quantum materials by tuning vdW interactions through fluctuating cavity photon fields.</p>

            <h2>Tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingting Liu, Shuhong Li, Yunlong Liu, Shuchao Qin, Yang Liu, Wenjun Wang, Minghui Qin</p>
            <p>The nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves (SWs) offers opportunities for developing novel functional magnonic logic devices, where controllability is crucial for magnetic signal processing. Domain walls act as natural waveguides due to their magnetic configuration, offering a platform for the in-depth investigation of nonreciprocal SW propagation and its manipulation. In this work, we theoretically and numerically investigate the tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels under the influence of an external field. It is revealed that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) exerts dual control over both nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation and spin-splitting phenomena. Moreover, SW nonreciprocity is magnetically tunable, with its sign reversibly switched by inverting the applied field direction, while preserving the host spin configuration. The orientation of the magnetic field can selectively stabilize or destabilize the domain wall structure, offering precise control over spin-wave nonreciprocity. Ultimately, we demonstrate a controllable SW transmission scheme via external magnetic field modulation, providing critical insights for the design of future magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>We report a comprehensive magneto-optical investigation of FePS$_3$ single crystals using temperature-dependent polarized transmission spectroscopy and Faraday rotation measurements. Our data reveal pronounced in-plane anisotropy in both phonon and magnon excitations, emerging distinctly below the NÃ©el temperature ($T_N \approx 118$ K). A prominent magnon mode at 122 cm$^{-1}$ exhibits characteristic redshifting with increasing temperature and field-induced splitting, confirming its magnetic origin. The optical conductivity, extracted via Drude-Lorentz modeling, shows polarization-sensitive spectral changes across the magnetic transition. The appearance of Raman-active modes in the infrared spectra, along with the observation of multiple phonons contributing to Faraday rotation, provides compelling evidence for spin-phonon coupling and inversion symmetry breaking in the magnetically ordered state. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$, positioning it as a model system for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.D. Adebanjo, J.P. Hague, P.E. Kornilovitch</p>
            <p>Superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices is investigated using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stijn van der Ham, Alexander Brown, Halim Kusumaatmaja, Hanumantha Rao Vutukuri</p>
            <p>The deformability of vesicles critically influences their engulfment by lipid membranes, a process central to endocytosis, viral entry, drug delivery, and intercellular transport. While theoretical models have long predicted this influence, direct experimental validation has remained elusive. Here, we combine experiments with continuum simulations to quantify how vesicle deformability affects the engulfment of small giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by larger GUVs under depletion-induced adhesion. Using 3D confocal reconstructions, we extract vesicle shape, curvature, wrapping fraction, and the bendo-capillary length, a characteristic length scale that balances membrane bending and adhesion forces. We find that when vesicle size exceeds this length scale, engulfment is primarily governed by geometry. In contrast, when vesicle size is comparable to this scale, deformability strongly affects the transition between shallow, deep, and fully wrapped states, leading to suppression of full engulfment of vesicles. These findings connect theoretical predictions with direct measurements and offer a unified framework for understanding vesicle-mediated uptake across both synthetic and biological systems, including viral entry, synthetic cell design, drug delivery, and nanoparticle internalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masayuki Ishida, Soichiro Fukuoka, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka, Le Duc Anh</p>
            <p>While ferromagnet and topological material bilayers are widely studied to obtain efficient spin charge conversion via topological surface states (TSS), the influence of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) on the TSS evolution and conversion efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally probe and reveal the behavior of spin momentum locked TSS through spin pumping measurements in heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Fe and the topological Dirac semimetal alpha Sn. As the alpha Sn thickness (tSn) increases from 9 to 35 nm, the Gilbert damping constant of the Fe layer exhibits a pronounced peak at tSn = 25 nm, followed by a decrease at greater thicknesses. Our rigorous theoretical analysis, combining analytical modeling and first principles calculations, attributes this behavior to the TSS disappearance at the Fe and alpha Sn interface and exchange gap opening on the opposite surface, both induced by the long range MPE and its influence on the spin charge conversion efficiency. At tSn = 25 nm, we demonstrate highly efficient spin charge conversion with an inverse Edelstein length of 3.14 nm, the highest value reported at room temperature for ferromagnet and topological material bilayers. These findings underscore the critical role of tuning TSS properties under MPE for advancing topological materials in spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The 4d-electron trimer lattice exhibits either a quantum spin liquid (QSL) or a heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. In the QSL state, itinerant spinons act as effective heat carriers, enhancing thermal conductivity. Strikingly, applying a magnetic field up to 14 T causes an abrupt increase in heat capacity by as much as 5000% below 150 mK, disrupting the linear temperature dependence characteristic of both phases. Meanwhile, AC magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity remain nearly unchanged, while thermal conductivity is suppressed by up to 40% below 4 K. These observations suggest that spinons, though charge-neutral, are highly sensitive to magnetic fields at low temperatures. We propose that the field induces Anderson localization of spinons, leading to emergent non-magnetic two-level systems that account for the rapid rise in heat capacity. These findings uncover a previously unexplored regime of spinon dynamics, governed by field-induced localization and distinct from conventional magnetic or transport signatures.

Here, we investigate the magnetic excitations and charge order in Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$, a vdW ferromagnet with $\approx$ 315 K Curie temperature. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe a dual nature of magnetic excitations, comprising a coherent magnon and a broad non-dispersive continuum extending up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher than in Fe$_{2.72}$GeTe$_2$. The continuum intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the stacking direction $L$, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our results indicate that while the dual character of the magnetic excitations is generic to Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$ exhibits a longer out-of-plane magnetic correlation length, suggesting enhanced 3D magnetic character. Furthermore, resonant x-ray diffraction reveals that previously reported $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks originate from crystal structure rather than from charge order.</p>

            <p>Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</p>

Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moirÃ©-periodic "bumps" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~Ã and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~Ã. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 2.45^{\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\theta} \approx 60^{\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.</p>

            <h2>Spin orientation -- a subtle interplay between strain and multipole Coulomb interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhra Sen Gupta, Shinjini Paul, Suman Mandal, D. D. Sarma, Priya Mahadevan</p>
            <p>We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maritza Ahumada, Natalia Valderrama-Quinteros, Diego Tancara, Guillermo Romero</p>
            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional systems is pivotal for quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model, where each lattice unit integrates a single-mode resonator that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLSs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and qubit-qubit interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insights into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Electronic structure of SLSiN under charge density modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashkan Shekaari</p>
            <p>First-principles density-functional theory calculations were carried out to assess how incremental unit-cell charging alters the electronic behavior of SLSiN (single-layer Si$_3$N$_4$). The net charge per cell was systematically tuned from $n\,=\,0$ (the neutral/reference configuration) to $n\,=\,\pm\,1,\pm\,2$, and $\pm\,3$ elementary charges, and for each charged configuration the band structure and density of states were evaluated at the PBE level. In its neutral state, SLSiN exhibits zero electronegativity, signifying both its indifference to additional electron density and its intrinsic stability when integrated into heterostructures. Altogether, these results reveal that precise control of the charge density can drive SLSiN across an insulator-to-metal transition.</p>

            <h2>Andreev molecules at distance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik S. Samuelsen, Yuli V. Nazarov</p>
            <p>Andreev molecule states arise from hybridization of Andreev bound states in different Josephson Junctions. Extensive theoretical and experimental research concentrates on direct coherent electron coupling between the junctions: this implies the distance between the junctions is of the order of superconducting coherence length, that is, short. We propose and discuss the possibility to create Andreev molecules at long (in principle, arbitrary long) distance between the junctions. In this case, the hybridized states are excited quasi-particle singlets and the coupling is provided by an embedding electric circuit. To achieve a strong hybridization, one aligns the energies of the Andreev bound states with associated phase differences. In fact, a recent experiment realizes such setup. With circuit theory we derive the hybridization level splitting and estimate the scale of the effect. Since the phenomenon encompasses excited states, we derive and solve the associated Lindblad equation under condition of persistent resonant excitation. By analyzing the resulting dissipative dynamics we identify relevant regimes where the hybridization and resonant excitation peaks are most pronounced. The low-frequency mutual inductance of the Josephson junctions is an important signature of the molecular state and associated non-local Josephson effect. We demonstrate the peak structures for both mutual and self-inductance, and compute them in various frequency regimes. In an interesting common case the embedding circuit includes an oscillator, which can be used both to enhance hybridization and for state readout with two-tone spectroscopy. We derive and solve Lindblad equations for the conditions of two-tone spectroscopy to demonstrate the the readout of molecular states.</p>

            <h2>Trimer superfluidity of antiparallel dipolar excitons in a bilayer heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pradyumna P. Belgaonkar, Michal Zimmerman, Snir Gazit, Dror Orgad</p>
            <p>We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Eugen Dizer, Emilio Ramos RodrÃ­guez, Richard Schmidt</p>
            <p>We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</p>

            <p>Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.</p>

            <h2>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen</p>
            <p>The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum oscillation and topology change of the uncondensed Landau Fermi surface in superconducting CeCoIn5</h2>

            <p>Metals typically have multiple Fermi surface sheets, and when they enter the superconducting state, some electrons on these sheets may remain uncondensed, or their superconducting pairs can be rapidly destroyed by a magnetic field. Detecting uncondensed electrons within the superconducting state provides key information about the underlying electronic structure; however, this task remains a significant experimental challenge. Here we demonstrate quantum oscillations from the uncondensed electrons in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5, observed through thermal conductivity measurements with a magnetic field rotating within the tetragonal a-b plane. We detect a fine structure in thermal conductivity, characterized by multiple small resonances (oscillations) in a rotating magnetic field. Remarkably, the phase of these resonances shifted by as much as {\pi} for a field above 9.7 T where spin-density wave (SDW) order emerges and coexists with superconductivity. This phase shift is naturally explained by a change in the Berry phase of the uncondensed Fermi surface, driven by the Fermi surface reconstruction associated with the onset of SDW order. Our work unambiguously shows the existence of uncondensed electrons in the superconducting state of CeCoIn5, thus resolving a longstanding debate on this issue.</p>

            <p>Long-life interlayer excitons (IXs) in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructure are promising for realizing excitonic condensates at high temperatures. Critical to this objective is to separate the IX ground state (the lowest energy of IX state) emission from other states emissions. Filtering the IX ground state is also essential in uncovering the dynamics of correlated excitonic states, such as the excitonic Mott insulator. Here, we show that the IX ground state in WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer can be separated from other states by its spatial profile. The emissions from different moire IX modes are identified by their different energies and spatial distributions, which fits well with the rate-diffusion model for cascading emission. Our results show spatial filtering of the ground state mode and enrich the toolbox to realize correlated states at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <p>We explore phases of two-component Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates in three spatial dimensions. The competition between the effective ranges of inter- and intra-component soft-core interactions leads to a rich variety of ground states. These include states resembling ionic compounds with face-centered cubic or simple cubic lattice structure. Upon increasing the scattering length, the dimensionality of the symmetry-breaking is lower due to the suppression of large densities, leading to segregated planar or tubular density profiles. We also show that these states are not only stable ground states, but can also emerge dynamically upon time evolution.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional charge density wave in Kagome metal BaFe2Al9</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liucheng Chen, Mingwei Ma, Xiaohui Yu, Fang Hong</p>
            <p>The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally, CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems. Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Excitons are bosonic quasiparticles with a variety of applications in optoelectronics, photosyn thesis, and dissipationless informatics, and their lifetime can become sufficiently long to form a quantum condensate. While exciton condensation has been predicted to occur as a ground state of a solid, so called an excitonic insulator, whose material realization has been elusive. Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta2Pd3Te5 below its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase transition. This measurement further discloses the size and the unusual odd parity of the exciton wave function. The present finding opens an avenue toward applications of coherent excitons in solid systems and searching for exotic quantum phases of exciton condensates.</p>

            <p>Exciton spectroscopy serves as a sensitive probe of electronic states in two-dimensional semiconductors. A prominent feature in optical spectra is the trion peak arising from the binding of a charge carrier to an exciton. The splitting between the exciton and trion peaks is usually interpreted as the trion binding energy, but we theoretically show that this view is incomplete. Since dark excitons are more strongly bound than the bright exciton, the trion wave function is asymmetric and a large contribution to the measured splitting is the difference between the bright and dark exciton binding energies. Our model quantitatively explains the measured trion energies in MoSe2 and WSe2, demonstrating the importance of the internal structure of the exciton for the interpretation of the optical response of transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.</p>

            <p>In a Josephson junction involving multi-band superconductors, competition between inter-band and inter-junction Josephson coupling gives rise to frustration and spatial disjunction of superfluid densities among superconducting condensates. Such frustrated coupling manifests as quantum interference of Josephson currents from different tunneling channels and becomes tunable if channel transparency can be varied. To explore these unconventional effects in the prototypical $s^\pm$-wave superconductor FeSe, we use atomic resolution scanned Josephson tunneling microscopy SJTM for condensate resolved imaging and junction tuning -- capabilities unattainable in macroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively demonstrate frustrated Josephson tunneling by examining two tunneling inequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunneling pathways is found tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0-pi transition with decreasing SJTM junction resistance. Simultaneous visualization of both superconducting condensates reveals anti correlated superfluid modulations, highlighting the role of inter-band scattering. Our study establishes SJTM as a powerful tool enabling new research frontiers of multi condensate superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases, although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably, fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the NÃ©el-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS with nontrivial spatial connectivity. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</p>

Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field for electron systems.</p>

We also performed ODMR measurements on multiple microdiamonds sealed inside a sample chamber and found that the resonance frequency varied with the pressure distribution. The combination of NPD and microdiamonds containing NV centers is auspicious for pressure and magnetic imaging under concurrent high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.</p>

            <h2>Topological Majorana flat bands in the Kitaev model on a Bishamon-kikko lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiyu Fukui, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>We unveil an interesting example of topological flat bands of Majorana fermions in quantum spin liquids. We study the Kitaev model on a periodically depleted honeycomb lattice, under a magnetic field within the perturbation theory. The model can be straightforwardly extended while maintaining the exact solvability, and its ground state is a quantum spin liquid as on the honeycomb lattice. As fractionalized excitations, there are unpaired localized Majorana fermions in addition to the itinerant Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes. We show that in the absence of the magnetic field the Majorana fermions have completely flat bands at zero energy, and by applying the magnetic field, they turn into topological flat bands with nonzero Chern number. By varying the anisotropy of the interactions and the magnitude of the magnetic field, we clarify that the system exhibits a variety of topological phases that do not appear in the original model. We emphasize that the topological flat bands that give this rich topology come from the hybridization of the Majorana flat bands and unpaired Majorana fermions, which is unique to the flat bands of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids. Our findings would stimulate the exploration of a new type of Kitaev materials exhibiting rich topology from topological Majorana flat bands.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Electric Control of Individual Molecules on Surfaces</h2>

            <p>Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC) for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway towards electrically controlled quantum operation.</p>

            <p>Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn, a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields $T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of molecular-based spin qubits.</p>

            <p>In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim) gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit gate set for spin-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Topological superconductors offer a fertile ground for realizing Majorana zero modes -- topologically protected, zero-energy quasiparticles that are resilient to local perturbations and hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for intrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the McMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed superconducting (SC) gap $\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter $\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable surface SC gaps ($\Delta > 10\,\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting remarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic level, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building on this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we uncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that ubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical simulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an anisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that the observed ABSs are of topological origin. The combination of a large, nontrivial pairing gap and accessible surface states establishes PtBi$_2$ as a compelling platform for investigating topological superconductivity and its associated Majorana modes.</p>

            <p>We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.</p>

            <p>J-aggregates are promising organic materials for nanophotonic applications due to their excitonic properties and ability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature, providing a robust platform for nanoscale light manipulation. While thin films composed of J-aggregates have demonstrated these advantages, colloidal J-aggregate nanoparticles remain underexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of colloidal J-aggregate flakes by electrostatic interaction of cyanine molecules (TDBC) and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). These flakes exhibit colloidal stability maintaining the J-aggregate conformation even in solvents that favoured their monomeric state. The characterization of the colloidal J-aggregate flakes reveals their capability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature. This was further confirmed at single-particle level by observing an angular-independent Reststrahlen band near the excitonic resonance. In addition, the colloidal flakes exhibit a strong scattering component that broadens the extinction band and redshifts the photoluminescence, indicating that the colloidal architecture influences the optical response. These findings introduce a versatile colloidal system for constructing excitonic nanostructures tailored for advanced photonic applications.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a dynamical regime emerges, characterized by a dual response in the inelastic spectrum composed of short-live dispersive excitations and a quasi-elastic component. Strongly frustrated exchange interactions combined with subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects are a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of this spin-liquid behavior.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

For the symmetry allowed geometry with the $\mathbf{k}\parallel[111]$ crystal axes, the nonreciprocal dependence of the SHG intensity on the magnetic field direction is found. It is explained by an interference of the crystallographic and magnetic-field-induced SHG signals. Relative phases of these signals are evaluated from the rotational anisotropy diagrams. Phenomenological and microscopic models of the effect are developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of the nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductor crystals, and the first one for exciton-polaritons.</p>

            <p>Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.</p>

            <p>The generation of indistinguishable single photons is a fundamental requirement for future quantum technologies, particularly in quantum repeater networks and for distributed quantum computing based on entanglement distribution. However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in epitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their practical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach to mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into an electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission enhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge environment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon extraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton dephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in visibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at the optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to 1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a quasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time (T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 = 2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions from rate equation modeling and quantum optical analysis as well as voltage-dependent linewidth measurements, demonstrating optimized electrical control of exciton dephasing.</p>

            <p>Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by NÃ©el vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.</p>

All the simulations, including the effective coupling between the fusing MZMs, and their coupling to the probing quantum dot, are based on the lattice model of a Rashba quantum wire in proximity contact with an s-wave superconductor, under the modulation of mini-gate voltage control.</p>

            <p>Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.</p>

            <p>Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials have already reached the stage of trial FAB integration. However, reliability limitations caused by various defects present a serious obstacle for their smooth way forward, especially when scaling the device geometries. Still the ongoing research is mostly focused on pure technology aspects, while reliability is often recalled only when showing a randomly measured gate transfer curve to manifest that the hysteresis is "negligible".In fact the hysteresis dynamics contain unique fingerprints of various mechanisms which may coexist or cancel each other, being more complex in scaled FETs, for instance because of simultaneous interaction of defects with the channel and top gate in thin insulators. To fill this gap, here by doing TCAD modeling for nanoscale MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs we introduce the universal hysteresis mapping method which can correctly capture commonly measured diverse hysteresis dynamics such as conventional clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis, as well as CW/CCW switching and time separation. Next we extend this method to bias-temperature instabilities (BTI) and show a clear correlation between complex hysteresis dynamics and abnormal BTI recovery. Finally, we validate our mapping method using available experimental data for MoS$_2$ FETs and demonstrate that it provides far more accurate results than a conventional constant current extraction of the hysteresis width, being also usable if a CCW hysteresis is caused by mobile ions.</p>

            <p>Computational methods for designing interactions between colloidal particles that induce self-assembly have received much attention for their promise to discover tailored materials. However, it often remains a challenge to translate computationally designed interactions to experiments because they may have features that are too complex, or even infeasible, to physically realize. Toward bridging this gap, we leverage relative-entropy minimization to design pair potentials for binary mixtures of colloidal particles that assemble crystal superlattices. We reduce the dimensionality and extent of the interaction design space by enforcing constraints on the form and parametrization of the pair potentials that are physically motivated by DNA-functionalized nanoparticles. We show that several two- and three-dimensional lattices, including honeycomb and cubic diamond, can be assembled using simple interactions despite their complex structures. We also find that the initial conditions used for the designed parameters as well as the assembly protocol play important roles in determining the outcome and success of the assembly process.</p>

            <p>An important aspect of materials research is the ability to tune different physical properties through controlled alloying. The Ln$_3$M$_4$X$_{13}$ (Ln = Lanthanide, M = Transition Metal, X = Tetrel) filled skutterudite family is of interest due to the tunability of its constituent components and their effects on physical properties, such as superconductivity and complex magnetism. In this work, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ (x = 0 -- 2) was synthesized via excess Sn-flux and characterized using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and heat capacity. Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and its Ge-solid-solution members crystallize in the Pm-3n space group, which has two unique Wyckoff positions for the tetrel (X) site. In the solid solution members, Ge shows preferential occupancy for one of the two Wyckoff sites, reaching $\sim$60$\%$ and 100$\%$ occupancy when x = 1 and 2, respectively. Magnetometry and heat capacity measurements of Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ indicated antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$ = 7.3 K. However, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{12}$Ge and Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{11}$Ge$_2$ showed notably lower-temperature antiferromagnetic phase transitions with substantial peak-broadening at $T_N$ = 5.5 K and 4.1 K, respectively. These data suggest that alloying Ge into Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ causes magnetic frustration within the structure, likely attributable to a change in the density of states from additional Ge $p$ states at the Fermi level. This work demonstrates that preferentially alloying Ge in Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ allows for more precise tunability of its magnetic structure, elucidating design principles for different quantum phases in intermetallic materials.</p>

            <h2>The carbon cost of materials discovery: Can machine learning really accelerate the discovery of new photovoltaics?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Walker, Keith T. Butler</p>
            <p>Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.</p>

            <p>Size polydispersity in colloidal particles can disrupt order in their self-assembly, ultimately leading to a complete suppression of crystallization. In contrast to various computational studies, few experimental studies systematically address the effects of size polydispersity on the quality of colloidal crystals. We present an experimental study of structural order in thin films of crystals vertically dried from colloidal dispersions with a systematically varying polydispersity. As expected, an increase in polydispersity leads to a deterioration in order with significant drops in the local bond-orientational order at 8% and 12% polydispersity. Our results align with previously suggested models of epitaxial-like growth of 2D layers during convective assembly. Our results can offer critical insights into the permissible limits for achieving colloidal crystals from more polydisperse systems such as those synthesized through more sustainable methods.</p>

            <p>Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson, Franz Herzog, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu</p>
            <p>We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena, and we perform a detailed comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative predictions. Our results expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</p>

            <h2>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsung-Cheng Lu, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Yizhi You</p>
            <p>Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory</h2>

            <p>We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.</p>

            <p>Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$, and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t) \sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems, identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of non-integrable behavior.</p>

            <h2>Space of conformal boundary conditions from the view of higher Berry phase: Flow of Berry curvature in parametrized BCFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueda Wen</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems, where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.</p>

            <p>An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</p>

            <p>Quantum-to-classical transition for finite-dimensional systems is widely considered to occur continuously, yet the mechanism underlying the intermediate stage remains unclear.

Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems.

            <p>Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems, from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however, such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</p>

            <p>Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</p>

            <p>The investigation of transport characteristics in high-temperature superconductors under magnetic fields is one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics and transport applications. For YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO), the measurements of magnetoresistance under a high magnetic field are technically challenging because the required magnetic field ($B$) to suppress the superconductivity is 100~T class. The low temperature (from 52 to 150 K) longitudinal magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$ab-plane$\parallel$$J$, where $J$ is an electrical current) was measured up to 103~T in optimally doped YBCO thin films. A radio frequency reflection method and the single-turn coil technique were employed. The electrical resistivity $\rho_{ab}$ exhibited a non-saturating magnetoresistance behavior until the highest field region, with the slope $\beta (=d \rho/d B)$ showing a pronounced deviation compared to the transverse magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$c-axis) case. These findings suggest a potential contribution due to the non-orbital origin in the high field phase of YBCO, because the quasiparticle orbital motion is expected to be absent in the longitudinal magnetoresistance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Han Teng, Anna GrÃ¼nebohm</p>
            <p>Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the entanglement between two continuous bosonic modes, such as magnons and photons, is not trivial. The logarithmic negativity, calculated through the quantum Langevin equations is subjected to thermal noise. However this method requires further approximation. The phase space of a generic nonlinear system contains topologically different regions, and the steady state may correspond to the different types of fixed points, such as Saddle Points, Stable or unstable Spirals, and Nodes. In the present work, we propose a new procedure. Namely, we derived the complete set of nonlinear equations, which includes equations for the magnon and photon number operators and phases. We show that not only number operators but also phases are important for exploring the character of the fixed point, and magnon-photon entanglement. We showed that methods of the qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations are also relevant for photon-magnon entanglement problems. Our main finding is that entanglement is not defined in the Saddle Point region. On the other hand, the maximum of the entanglement corresponds to the region near the border between the Stable node and Stable spiral regions. Our approach is quite general. However, we did calculations for a particular system: photon-magnon crystal based on the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film with the periodic air holes drilled in the film. Our interest focuses on magnons with a particular wavelength and frequency corresponding to the magnon condensate. Those magnons couple strongly with the photons of similar frequency. We discuss in detail the interaction between magnons and photons originating from the magneto-electric coupling and the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that this interaction is responsible for the robust photon-magnon entanglement in the system.</p>

We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Han Lin, Jin-Wei Dong, Ruiqing Fu, Xian-Xin Wu, Ziqiang Wang, Sen Zhou</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagomÃ© metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagomÃ© lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagomÃ© lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagomÃ© metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagomÃ© lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagomÃ© metal FeGe.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic anisotropy effect on stabilizing magnetization plateaus of kagome strip chain Heisenberg antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiara Bruzzi, Jian-Xin Zhu, Yixuan Huang</p>
            <p>We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field, but the plateaus become much smaller with anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further show the anisotropic effect of the magnon excitations of the 0.6 plateau state using linear spin wave theory. The magnon bandwidth remains small when tuning the anisotropic interactions along the field where the magnetization plateau is stable, while the band becomes more dispersive with anisotropic interactions perpendicular to the field. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the Hamiltonian of the kagome strip chain is dominated by two separate spin chains. This can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in kagome strip chain materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.</p>

            <p>Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Amplitude mode in a multi-gap superconductor MgB$_2$ investigated by terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kota Katsumi, Jiahao Liang, Ralph Romero III, Ke Chen, Xiaoxing Xi, N. P. Armitage</p>
            <p>We have investigated the terahertz (THz) nonlinear response of the multigap superconductor MgB$_2$, using THz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz 2DCS). With broadband THz drive fields, we identified a nonlinear response at twice the lower superconducting gap energy $2\Delta_{\pi}$ at the lowest temperatures. Using narrow-band THz driving pulses, we observed first (FH) and third harmonic responses. The FH intensity shows a monotonic increase with decreasing temperature when properly normalized by the driving field strength. This is distinct from the single-gap superconductor NbN, where the FH signal exhibited a resonant enhancement at temperatures when twice the gap energy $2\Delta$ was resonant with the driving photon energy, which was interpreted to originate from the superconducting amplitude mode. Our results in MgB$_2$ are consistent with a well-defined amplitude mode only at the lowest temperatures and indicate strong damping as temperature increases. This likely indicates the importance of interband coupling in MgB$_2$ and its influence on the nature of the amplitude mode and its damping.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Local Pairs through Nonequilibrium Terahertz Spectroscopy in YBa2Cu3O7-Î´ Below Tc</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinzhong Zhang, Qingming Huang, Zhangqiang Yang, Zhiyuan Sun, Ye Yang</p>
            <p>Pairing states are essential to understanding the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Here the non-superconducting state in an optimally doped YBa_2 Cu_3 O_(7-{\delta}) film was driven out of equilibrium by an optical pump with low fluence at a temperature well below the critical temperature (T_c), and its recovery dynamics were exclusively measured using transient terahertz spectroscopy. The pump-fluence dependent experiments unveiled evidence of local pairs without superconductivity coexisting with the superconducting Cooper pairs. An energy gap opening induced by the local pairing with short-range coherence was invoked to rationalize the temperature-dependent recovery time of local pairs with a characteristic divergence at a temperature substantially below T_c. These local pairs displayed remarkable likeness to the short-range pair-density-wave state. Our finding sheds light on understanding the dynamic interplay between the coexisting superconducting and non-superconducting pairs in cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijiang Ji, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.</p>

            <h2>Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$</h2>

            <p>Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However, a second sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, signifying the entrance to the ground state. The ground state appears to have gapped excitations, as even the most abrupt extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K fully accounts for the $R\ln(2)$ entropy associated with the pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$ at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$ for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). For both scenarios, comparison of the measured $C_P$ with NLC calculations suggests that weak interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian become relevant below $T \sim 0.25$ K. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). Together with the peak in the heat capacity at $T_1$, this diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is suggestive of a classical spin liquid regime above $T_1$ that is distinct from the zero-entropy quantum ground state below $T_1$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Bing Luo, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. However, a topological semimetal that possesses both nodal points and nodal lines is rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this type of topological semimetal, which simultaneously exhibits hinge Fermi arcs and drumhead surface states. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-line structures and its conversion into a first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in a static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, and establish a foundation for further exploration of their potential applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rene Alvarez-Donado, Matias Sepulveda-Macias, Anne Tanguy</p>
            <p>We employed molecular dynamics simulations to explore comparatively the thermo-mechanical behavior of two glass materials-an oxide silica glass (SiO2) and a binary Cu-Zr-based metallic alloy (Cu50Zr50)-during shear and elongation deformation cycles. By calculating the energy balance and tracking the temperature evolution of both glasses under deformation cycles, we are able to propose, for each of them, a constitutive law which accurately reproduces the self-heating process due to plastic deformation. These relatively simple constitutive laws involve strain rate sensitivity and a non-linear temperature dependence of the thermal dilatancy coefficients, as well as strain gradient plasticity. To identify the right parameters, both glasses are equilibrated at very low temperature (10 K) and two independent deformation rates were applied to each sample for each type of deformation. Thermal attenuation is greatly amplified in silica compared to the metallic glass. Moreover, using precise atomic description of the instantaneous deformation, combined with exact coarse-graining procedure, we show, in silica, that self-heating is mainly supported by inhomogeneous strain gradient plasticity with nanometric characteristic lengthscales.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of universality in transport of noisy free fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JoÃ£o Costa, Pedro Ribeiro, Andrea De Luca</p>
            <p>We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems of non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under mild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in the thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently introduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge transport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality class, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as the classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies on a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the current is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the cumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact correspondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of noisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show that their transport properties are essentially classical.</p>

            <p>Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the role played by the initial dislocation density which significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. Since the initial micro-structure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be conjectured. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</p>

Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.</p>

            <h2>A collapsed interface approach to resolve grain boundaries in finite element simulations of polycrystalline diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lena Scholz, Yongliang Ou, Blazej Grabowski, Felix Fritzen</p>
            <p>Atomic diffusion affects the properties of various engineering materials, which predominantly occur in the polycrystalline state. A rigorous description of polycrystalline diffusion must therefore account for crystallographic defects, especially grain boundaries (GBs), whose structure and volume fraction - and hence the effective grain size - govern mass transport. Experiments and atomistic simulations consistently show that GBs can accelerate diffusion by up to several orders of magnitude and that fluxes along and across the interface are generally anisotropic. Conventional mesoscale models either neglect GBs or invoke idealized analytical corrections. Fully resolved finite-element meshes are accurate but computationally infeasible when nanometer-thin GB layers are involved. We introduce a collapsed-interface finite element that integrates the GB thickness analytically and embeds the result in a two-dimensional surface element. The formulation (i) treats in-plane and through-plane diffusivity independently, (ii) couples to the surrounding grain matrix without the need for mesh manipulations, and (iii) parametrizes both grain size and GB volume fraction via simple affine scalings, allowing systematic variation without remeshing. Effective diffusivity tensors are extracted by linear computational homogenization. The new finite element reproduces three-dimensional GB transport phenomena - channeled fluxes, concentration discontinuities - at a fraction of the computational cost of explicit models. Parametric studies spanning multiple orders of magnitude in GB diffusivity reveal four distinct diffusion regimes and quantify their impact on the overall response. The framework thus connects atomistic data and continuum predictions, providing an efficient tool for diffusion-driven design and optimization of polycrystalline materials.</p>

We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional "level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</p>

            <p>Multi-alkali antimonides (MAAs) are promising materials for vacuum electron sources. While sodium-based MAAs have demonstrated superior characteristics for ultrabright electron sources, their synthesis remains challenging, often resulting in mixed stoichiometries and polycrystalline domains. To address this complexity and guide the characterization of experimentally grown photocathodes, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of four ternary MAAs: cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, representing the experimentally known phase of each stoichiometry, as well as hexagonal Na$_2$KSb and cubic NaK$_2$Sb, two computationally predicted polymorphs. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium and potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and L$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the experimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, particularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing useful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further investigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their counterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting their significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower core levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the experimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA photocathodes, complementing experiments on resolved phases and providing the spectral fingerprints of computationally predicted phases that could emerge in polycrystalline samples.</p>

            <p>Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</p>

Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.</p>

            <h2>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan T. Grimm, Alexander J. Staat, Joel D. Eaves</p>
            <p>The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</p>

            <p>In this work we demonstrate a spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic field sensor, designed as a Ta/CoFeB/MgO structure, with high sensitivity and capable of active offset compensation in all three spatial directions. This is described and verified in both experiment and simulation. The measurements of magnetic fields showed an offset of 36, 50, and 37$\mathrm{\mu T}$ for x-, y-, and z-fields. Furthermore, the sensitivities of these measurements had values of 590, 580, and 490$\mathrm{V\,A^{-1}\,T^{-1}}$ in the x-, y-, and z-direction. In addition, the robustness to bias fields is demonstrated via experiments and single spin simulations by applying bias fields in y-direction. Cross sensitivities were further analyzed via single spin simulations performing a parameter sweep of different bias fields in the y- and z-direction up to $\pm$1mT. Finally, the extraction of the SOT parameters $\eta_\mathrm{DL}$ and $\eta_\mathrm{FL}$ is shown via optimization of a single-spin curve to the experimental measurements.</p>

            <h2>SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction: An S-scheme photocatalyst with high visible-light absorption, excellent carrier mobility and adjustable band gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuzhu Yang, Wenhui Wan, Zhicui Wang, Qiuyue Ma, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu</p>
            <p>Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdus Salam Sarkar</p>
            <p>The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion & storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchang Cai, Rui-Xing Zhang</p>
            <p>Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moirÃ© transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Yuhao Shi, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moirÃ© lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moirÃ© lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arabinda Bera, Debjyoti Majumdar, Timothy W. Sirk, Ido Regev, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier. We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable $s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.</p>

            <h2>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wesley W. Oliver, William M. Jacobs, Michael A. Webb</p>
            <p>Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</p>

            <p>CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou</p>
            <p>Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. Specifically, using a simple depolarizing channel, we show that the relaxation of a dissipative transverse-field Ising chain can be significantly accelerated, underscoring the experimental feasibility of the protocol. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier de la Cruz, Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch</p>
            <p>We study thermalization in a disordered one-dimensional interacting bosonic system described by the Aubry-Andre model using full exact diagonalization. We find a broad chaotic energy window where the system's eigenstates satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), demonstrated by the smooth energy dependence of observables like entanglement entropy and local particle number, whose fluctuations decrease with system size. Dynamically, we investigate the equilibration of initial Fock states and find that thermalization is not universal. The key finding is a direct and nontrivial correlation between an initial state's delocalization in the energy eigenbasis quantified by the Participation Ratio (PR) and its subsequent equilibration. States with a high PR consistently evolve toward the microcanonical ensemble prediction, whereas those exhibiting a low PR display deviations whose magnitude inversely correlates with the PR value. This connection is quantitatively confirmed by the trace distance, providing a powerful, experimentally relevant diagnostic for predicting which initial states will reach thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian entanglement dip from scaling-induced exceptional criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Liu, Hui Jiang, Wen-Tan Xue, Qingya Li, Jiangbin Gong, Xiaogang Liu, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Wampler, Nigel R. Cooper</p>
            <p>We show that absorbing state phase transitions where the absorbing state itself exhibits long-range phase coherence can lead to critical behavior distinct from directed percolation. To do this, we investigate a simple, purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model, which may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W state with errors. The "error" Lindblad jump operators preserve the W state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates and show that local remnants of the coherence persist in the decohering phase. The distinct critical behavior stems from the spreading of coherence throughout the system at the critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaud Guillin (LMBP), Leo Hahn (LMBP), Manon Michel (LMBP)</p>
            <p>Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated microparticles in microchannel flows. While smooth-walled channels preserve the dependence of particle trajectories on initial orientation and lateral position, we show that introducing periodically textured walls can trigger robust alignment of the particle along the channel centerline. This geometry-driven alignment arises from repeated reorientation torques generated by spatially modulated shear gradients near the textured walls. A resistive force theory-based analysis reveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the elongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at intermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on particle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range for maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low Reynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the Reynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime. These findings offer a predictive framework for designing microfluidic devices that passively sort or focus anisotropic particles, with implications for soft matter transport, biophysical flows, and microfluidic engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gopal Chandra Pal, Cheuk Wing Edmond Lam, Chander Shekhar Sharma</p>
            <p>Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Non-coalescence between water droplets has so far been observed during collisions of droplets moving with relative centroidal velocity, or in the presence of specific enabling effects such as high intervening gas pressures, surfactants, or large droplet sizes (diameter $\gtrsim 1~\mathrm{mm}$). Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a much wider range of droplet diameters, from millimeters to as small as 100 microns, without the need for any of the above factors. Such non-coalescence occurs in sessile droplet clusters on water-repellent surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, the evolving interface of the coalescing droplets comes in apparent contact with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster, but does not necessarily trigger further coalescence. In fact, such apparent contact can manifest as a bouncing interaction, and depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, it can result in significant lateral momentum generation, consequently leading to spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of the participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9\% for closely packed clusters of three sessile droplets and increases further with an increase in the number of participating droplets. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.</p>

            <p>The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the PoincarÃ© group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT). We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS. Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</p>

            <p>Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.</p>

            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst</p>
            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Davoodi</p>
            <p>Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double NÃ©el ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</p>

            <h2>Designing lattice spin models and magnon gaps with supercurrents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Martin Tang Bruland, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and magnon gaps without dissipative currents.</p>

            <h2>Î½-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</p>

            <h2>Multichannel topological Kondo models and their low-temperature conductances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangjie Li, Elio J. KÃ¶nig, Jukka I. VÃ¤yrynen</p>
            <p>In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator (LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.</p>

            <p>Understanding the generation, transport and capture of charge carriers in semiconductors is of fundamental technological importance. However, the ensemble measurement techniques ubiquitous in electronics offer limited insight into the nanoscale environment that is crucial to the operation of modern quantum-electronic devices. Here, we combine widefield optical microscopy with precision spectroscopy to examine the capture of photogenerated holes by negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. Simultaneous single-shot charge readout over hundreds of individual NVs allows us to resolve the roles of ionized impurities, reveal the formation of space charges fields, and monitor the thermalization of hot photo-carriers during diffusion. We measure effective NV- hole capture radii in excess of 0.2 um, a value approaching the Onsager limit and made possible here thanks to the near-complete neutralization of coexisting charge traps. These results establish a new platform for resolving charge dynamics beyond ensemble averages, with direct relevance to nanoscale electronics and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>High-throughput computational framework for lattice dynamics and thermal transport including high-order anharmonicity: an application to cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Huiju Lee, Chris Wolverton, Yi Xia</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can exceed 50% of total kL in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and Cl2O-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Paudyal, Michael E. FlattÃ©</p>
            <p>We present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of the long-range charge density wave (CDW) order and superconducting properties of the pristine and lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer. Stable CDW structures are obtained through atomic reconstruction driven by soft-mode distortions and lithiation, respectively, lead to significant electronic modifications that suppress the CDW order. This suppression is attributed to anisotropic atomic distortions, along with a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. As a result, the electron--phonon coupling strength is suppressed, particularly in the lithiated structure, due to reduced contributions from low-frequency phonons, primarily associated with in-plane Nb vibrations. Finally, we observe a sizable anisotropy in the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface, with a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 8~K in the distorted, and 4~K in the lithiated, CDW NbSe$_2$ monolayer.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Valley Locking and Pure Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets Proximitized to Conventional Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song-Bo Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu, Qian Niu, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>Unconventional antiferromagnets with spin-split bands, such as noncollinear magnets and the recently discovered altermagnets, serve as new constituents to explore unconventional superconductivity. Here, we unveil a new type and previously unappreciated nature of spin-valley locking in noncollinear antiferromagnets and exploit this texture to achieve pure spin-triplet superconductivity. Using chiral antiferromagnetic kagome lattices (e.g., Mn$_3$Ge and Mn$_3$Ga) coupled to conventional $s$-wave superconductors as prototypical examples, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic chirality strongly favors spin-triplet pairing via superconducting proximity effect, while suppressing spin-singlet pairing in the antiferromagnets away from the interfaces. Crucially, such a long-sought spin-triplet superconducting state is established without invoking the prevailing mechanism of spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Furthermore, the spin-triplet supercurrent is resilient to both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields, which exhibits distinct superiority to Ising superconductivity, serving as a compelling experimental signature of the triplet pairing and spin-valley-locked texture.</p>

These oscillations provide a definitive experimental signature of the quantized valley states and establish a new pathway to interface spintronics and valleytronics.</p>

            <p>The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems. Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds. While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>A straightforward way to determine the electric field gradient $-$ principal axes frame (EFG-PAF) on single crystal samples with spin 3/2 nuclei is demonstrated. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy is used to determine the Rabi frequency for $^{35}$Cl in a single crystal of potassium chlorate (KClO$_3$) by comparing the NQR signal for powder and single crystal samples. By exploiting the geometrical dependence of the Rabi frequency with respect to the excitation direction, EFG-PAF is readily determined. Furthermore, relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$ were measured at multiple temperatures ranging from $17~\textrm{K}$ to $200 ~$K, extending the results of previous works to colder temperatures where new relaxation mechanisms become dominant. The experiments were performed in a cryogen-free cryostat, which posed distinct challenges compared to a conventional cryogenic cooling setup. The successful operation of the NQR probe within a cryogen-free cryostat has the potential to make the technique more accessible and widen applications.</p>

            <h2>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Recent studies reveal that $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents generated via the nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) exhibit significant potential for spintronics applications, with both computational and experimental validations. Addressing the scarcity of conductive altermagnets, we propose strain engineering as a reliable method for inducing altermagnetism. Focusing on rutile-structured $\mathrm{OsO}_2$, first-principles calculations show that minor equibiaxial tensile strain ($\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$=3\%) induces nonmagnetic-to-altermagnetic transitions, achieving an ASSE-driven spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim$7\% -- far surpassing conventional spin Hall angles ($\theta_{\text{IS}}$). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to nonrelativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's nonrelativistic origin. Further investigation reveals that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</p>

            <p>The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> NiccolÃ² Francini, Pedro M. CÃ´nsoli, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>Ferrimagnetism appears in the temperature-field phase diagrams of several candidate Kitaev materials, such as the honeycomb cobaltates Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$. In a number of instances, however, the exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of ongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out candidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be reconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined time-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration. Instead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of noncollinear multi-$\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\mathbf q$ discussed in the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by computing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma model with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave theory. If the model realizes a triple-$\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated magnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior observed in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains in the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if the $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground state, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite temperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as expected from the symmetry analysis. The implications of our general result for other Kitaev materials exhibiting ferrimagnetic behavior are also briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT, where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states. Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is crucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena, especially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions, highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We study electron transport in monolayer molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ subjected to a magnetic barrier. Our analysis employs a full-band continuum model to capture the relevant physical phenomena. We focus on how electron energy, magnetic field strength, and the geometric characteristics of the barrier affect the transmission and conductance. We observe sharp resonant tunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by magnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct resonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are closely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in significant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate that adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and valley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron spin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Intermediate-valence behavior is sometimes observed in lanthanide-based materials containing Ce, Yb, Sm or Eu. However, the number of actinide-based systems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we present the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which turns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material shows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K, which can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of intermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the 5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\delta$Eex/kB $\approx$ 400 K and the corresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\approx$ 140 K. The value of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2 signals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical resistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual resistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change of sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at T = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic susceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical analysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Sensitivity of x-ray absorption at $5d$ edges of high-valent light actinides to crystal-field strength and covalency effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Vegelius, David K. Shuh, Sergei M. Butorin</p>
            <p>The $5f$ states were probed in ThO$_2$ and U(VI) and U(V) oxides using x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the actinide $O_{4,5}$ edges. Measured data were analyzed by several approaches including atomic, crystal-field theory and the Anderson impurity model to take into account the hybridization of actinide valence states with oxygen $2p$ states. For Th(IV), the $5f$ states are mainly affected by the crystal-field interaction with the closest neighbors as can be seen from the corresponding spectrum of ThO$_2$. In turn, for U(VI) and U(V) oxides, the U $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization and high degree of covalency in the chemical bonding play a decisive role increasing the $5f$ occupancy and consequently governing the ground and excited state properties. That is additionally illustrated by results from the calculations of the U $5d$ x-ray photoemission spectra for U(V) in the lattice of La-doped UO$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Marginal Metals and Kosterlitz-Thouless Type Phase Transition in Disordered Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-An Li, Bo Fu, Huaiming Guo, BjÃ¶rn Trauzettel, Song-Bo Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by convincing numerical evidence and propose a vortex-antivortex-like spin pair picture for its interpretation. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin-splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoresistance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Failed superconductivity in a Mott spin liquid material</h2>

            <p>A central challenge for understanding unconventional superconductivity in most strongly correlated electronic materials is their complicated band structure and presence of competing orders. In contrast, quasi-two-dimensional organic spin liquids are single-band systems with superconductivity arising near the bandwidth-tuned Mott metal-insulator transition in the absence of other orders. Here, we study chemically substituted $\kappa$-organics in which superconducting fluctuations emerge in the phase coexistence region between the Mott insulator and the Fermi liquid. Using magnetotransport and ac susceptibility measurements, we find that global superconductivity fails to set in as temperature $T\rightarrow 0$. Our results indicate instead the presence of superconducting domains embedded in the metallic percolating cluster that undergo a magnetic field-tuned quantum superconductor-to-metal phase transition. Surprisingly, albeit consistent with the percolation picture, universal conductance fluctuations are seen at high fields in macroscopic samples. The observed interplay of the intrinsic inhomogeneity and quantum phase fluctuations provides a new insight into failed superconductivity, a phenomenon seen in various conventional and unconventional superconductors, including cuprates.</p>

            <p>In moirÃ© crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations can be tuned by twist angles and stacking orders, forming various symmetry-broken states. Here we report twisted double rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system showing rich moirÃ© dependent topological phenomena. For small twist angles, programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moirÃ© filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed multiple first-order transitions and an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator. Interestingly, for a larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1 at fractional fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed, whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is absent. Our study demonstrated the twisted flatbands from rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to study topological correlated physics, offering a promising pathway toward developing new devices for quantum storage and computation.</p>

            <p>Vertically stacked van der Waals structures are promising platforms that enable layer engineering, opening new avenues for the quantum control of elementary excitations, including optically generated bound electron-hole pairs. Here we employ excited-state density functional calculations to demonstrate strong interlayer excitonic coupling in one-dimensional van der Waals nanostructures derived from armchair graphene nanoribbons. The excitonic response exhibits prominent peaks in the near-infrared range, mainly attributed to intralayer excitons, while interlayer excitations with absorption peak strengths of up to 13\% of the maximum absorption are also observed. Both type-I and type-II band alignments are found, which promote the formation of intralayer and interlayer excitons. Notably, interlayer excitons in these systems exhibit long-lived radiative lifetimes at room temperature, ranging from 1 nanosecond to 9.4 microseconds. Our calculations suggest the potential to tune the excitonic response and lifetimes of bilayer graphene nanoribbons via careful engineering of the stacking order.</p>

            <p>The emergence of two-dimensional magnets within the van der Waals toolkit has introduced unprecedented opportunities to develop ultrathin spintronic technologies. Strong coupling between spin and optical properties in such materials can further enable novel spin-photonic capabilities of both fundamental and technological interest. Here, we investigate the optical and spin properties of the air-stable, layered A-type antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4) when doped with Yb3+. We show that the collective spin properties of CrPS4 are encoded in the sharp f-f luminescence of isolated Yb3+ dopants via strong magnetic superexchange coupling between the two, and that spontaneous magnetic ordering in CrPS4 induces large exchange splittings in the narrow Yb3+ f-f photoluminescence features below TN. Spin reorientation in CrPS4 via a "spin-flop" metamagnetic transition modulates the Yb3+ f-f luminescence energies and exchange splittings. This pronounced link between spin and optical properties enables the demonstration of optically driven spin-flop transitions in CrPS4.</p>

            <p>The honeycomb magnet Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ recently emerged as a promising candidate for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid with relatively low levels of structural disorder. While the precise spin Hamiltonian remains controversial, the potential existence of a quantum spin liquid or other novel quantum magnetic phases continues to stimulate investigation. Here, we study the temperature and magnetic field-dependent spin excitations of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ on a twin-free single crystal using magneto-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, focusing on magnetic anisotropy and field-induced unusual phases. We observe a low-energy continuum excitation above $T_N$ and a 0.5 THz (2 meV) spin wave excitation in magnetic order under zero field. Upon applying an in-plane magnetic field, the spin waves transform to a magnetic continuum over an intermediate field range, above which the system enters a spin-polarized state. Crucially, the spin excitation spectra reveal striking anisotropy between the $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ crystallographic axes, demanding description by a strongly anisotropic spin model. These findings establish Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ as a model system for investigating field-tunable quantum magnetism and potential spin liquid behavior in highly anisotropic systems.</p>

            <p>The magnetic properties of two-dimensional altermagnets can be obtained from a square lattice Heisenberg model with antiferromagetic nearest neighbor interaction and two types of next-nearest neighbor interactions arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory we calculate for this model the corrections to the renormalized magnon spectrum and the staggered magnetization to first order in the inverse spin quantum number $1/S$. We also show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the $\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading $1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</p>

            <p>Specific heat is a powerful probe offering insights into the entropy and excitation spectrum of the studied material. While it is well established, a key challenge remains the measurements of microcrystals or thin films especially in the sub-Kelvin, high magnetic field regime. Here we present a setup combining the high sensitivity of SiN$_x$ membrane based calorimetry with the absolute accuracy of Coulomb blockade thermometry to realise a nanocalorimeter for such tasks. The magnetic field independent technique of Coulomb blockade thermometry provides an on-platform thermometer combining a primary thermometry mode for in-situ calibration with a fast secondary mode suitable for specific heat measurements. The setup is validated using measurements of a 20 $\mu$g sample of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ achieving a resolution on the order of 0.1 nJ/K at 500 mK and an absolute accuracy limited by the determination of the sample's mass. Measurements of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ further highlight the benefits of measuring microcrystals with such a device.</p>

            <p>In many situations, simply finding a target during a search is not enough. It is equally important to be able to return to that target repeatedly or to enable a larger community to locate and utilize it. While first passage time is commonly used to measure search success, relatively little is known about increasing the average rate of target encounters over time. Here, using an active Brownian particle model with chemotaxis, we demonstrate that when a searcher has no memory and there is no communication among multiple searchers, encoding information about the target's location in the environment outperforms purely memoryless strategies by boosting the overall hit rate. We further show that this approach reduces the impact of target size on a successful search and increases the total utilization time of the target.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface. Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect. Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.</p>

We report the realization of multiple high-C QAH insulators including C=3,5,6, and 7 in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. In twist angles of approximately 1.40Â°, we observe QAH effect with C=5 at a filling of one electron per moirÃ© unit cell, persisting up to 2 Kelvin. Furthermore, incommensurate QAH insulators with C=5,6, and 7 emerge at partial fillings. In twist angles of 0.89Â°, Chern insulators with C=3 and C=6 appear at fillings of two and three electrons, respectively. Our findings establish twisted rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a highly tunable platform for multichannel, dissipationless electronics and for the exploration of exotic quantum Hall states beyond traditional Landau level paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Wang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of magnetic flux and the odd-even parity of lattice points $N$ on electron transport in an annular Kitaev chain, with an explanation provided from the energy band perspective. Three transport mechanisms including direct transmission (DT), local Andreev reflection (LAR) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) are considered. In particular, the connection configuration of electrodes to different lattice sites is studied, where the case that the two electrodes connected to the sites are aligned along a diameter is called as symmetric connection and otherwise as asymmetric connections. For even $N$ and asymmetric connection, the vanished LAR and CAR in symmetric connection will emerge as peaks. A more prominent observation is that the symmetry of the two resonant peaks due to DT processes located at $\phi = \pi/3$ and $\phi = 2\pi/3$ for symmetric connection will be broken, and the peak at $\phi = \pi/3$ will be largely reduced, where $\phi$ is the magnetic flux per site. Moreover, the peaks around $\phi = \pi/3$ due to LAR and CAR processes grows drastically even larger than that from DT. For LAR and CAR processes, there is no peak around $\phi = 2\pi/3$ and transmission due to these two processes are completely suppressed for $\phi>\pi/2$. Moreover, it is found that the energy bands vary with $\phi$ in a period of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ for even or odd $N$. These behaviors reflect a complicated competition from DT, LAR and CAR processes and the parity of the lattice number in the Kitaev ring, which will be interested for the quantum device based on Kitaev chain.</p>

            <p>We present an efficient implementation of the magnetic force theorem which allows for direct evaluation of exchange parameters in q-space. The exchange parameters are calculated directly from Bloch states and the implementation does not rely on any mapping onto localized orbitals. This renders the approach well suited for high-throughput computations, where the construction of a localized basis set (for example Wannier functions) often is impractical. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by applying it to yttrium iron garnet, where we obtain excellent agreement with the experimental magnon dispersion without any prior assumptions of important exchange pathways. In particular, the calculations reveal the existence of several inequivalent exchange pathways associated with the same interatomic distances. Performing such calculations in q-space fully accounts for long-range exchange interactions and provides a convenient route for validating models obtained by fitting to inelastic neutron scattering data.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth triangular-lattice magnets serve as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum magnetic phenomena. Recently, the hexaaluminate \cmao\ has been proposed to host a $U(1)$ Dirac quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropy. Here, we report a systematic study of its analogue, \nzao, employing ac susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements establish a well-defined $J_\mathrm{eff}$ = 1/2 ground state with moderate Ising anisotropy ($g_c$ = 4.54, $g_\mathrm{ab}$ = 1.42). Muon spin relaxation measurements reveal persistent fluctuations emerging below $\sim$15\,K, and extending down to at least 0.28 K. AC susceptibility data further indicate an absence of magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50\,mK, despite an overall antiferromagnetic interaction with the Curie-Weiss temprature of $-0.42$\,K. These results suggest that \nzao\ is a good candidate material for realizing a quantum spin liquid state.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for exploring quantum phases from magnetic order in reduced dimensions. While there have been extensive studies on 2D magnetic materials based on 3$d$ electrons, experimental studies on 4$f$-electron counterparts are far fewer, particularly on their electronic structure. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy. Utilizing in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we uncover a large band splitting in the valence bands, which we attribute to the ferromagnetic order driven by exchange couplings between Sm 4$f$ moments and conduction electrons. Despite the small magnetic moment of Sm, the observed splitting is comparable to those of Eu- and Gd-based systems with much larger local moments. Interestingly, the surface state also exhibits splitting with similar magnitude and can be eliminated by overannealing, while the valence bands with ferromagnetic-like splittings remain robust. Our work provides spectroscopic insight to understand the electronic origin of magnetic order in Sm-based compounds. Our study also offers a platform to study 2D magnetic materials based on 4$f$ electrons.</p>

            <p>The influence of Sn alloying additions on the aqueous passivation behavior of Cu-Al alloys was revisited and found to function as a new third element effect in acidified 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The role of each element during the process of aqueous passivation was investigated using electrochemical and surface-sensitive ex-situ and in-operando spectroscopic techniques. The connection between passivation and the atomic arrangements of atoms in the solid solution was supported by first principles based cluster expansion calculations and Monte Carlo simulations probing the chemical short-range order in the Cu-Al-Sn system. High purity Sn, like high purity Cu, did not passivate in the test environment, whereas high purity Al formed a passive film with a stable passive current density of 0.01 mA/cm^2. Cu-xAl-Sn solid solution alloys where x greater than 18 at.%, containing less than 3 at.% Sn additions exhibited lower corrosion rates than Cu-xAl alloys, brought by Al(III) and Sn(IV, II) unidentified complex oxides formation on the surface. A strong influence of Sn on Al(III) passivation was observed, i.e., strongly suggesting a third element effect type behavior. Possible governing processes explaining the stainless steel type corrosion behavior are discussed, providing insights for exploring novel synergies in the design of corrosion resistant alloys.</p>

            <p>Optical lattice clocks have set records in clock precision and accuracy. Continuing to advance their performance, via probing as many atoms for the longest interrogation time affordable, requires experimentally and theoretically studying a many-body lattice system. Motivated by recent experimental results on a Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock, we present a theoretical overview of Ramsey and Rabi spectroscopy in one-dimensional chains. At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement conditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\approx 1-5$ atoms. We show that in the presence of spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock laser, the spectroscopy observables are modified by superexchange interactions within each chain, and depend strongly on the length of the chain. The thermal distribution of chain lengths thus plays a key role in the spectroscopy measurements. Our results offer insight into observable many-body effects in state-of-the-art lattice clocks and suggest new directions for optimizing clock performance.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Epoxy Composition on the Thermal and Network Properties of Crosslinked Thermosets: A Molecular-Dynamics Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Venkata Rama Manoj Pola, Alexey Lyulin</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the influence of resin composition on the thermal and structural properties of crosslinked epoxy networks using molecular-dynamics simulations. The systems studied are based on mixtures of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and butylated epoxy resin (BER), cured with diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). A multi-step crosslinking algorithm was used to generate highly crosslinked networks. We systematically explored how the addition of BER affects the network topology and thermophysical behavior of the resulting thermosets. Our results show that increasing BER content leads to a progressive loosening of the network, evidenced by longer inter-nitrogen path lengths and larger Voronoi atomic volumes. This structural loosening results in a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and higher atomic mobility as well as a reduction in the glass-transition temperature. To quantify local steric and topological effects, we introduce a confinement index that captures atomic-level crowding and connectivity. The index shows a strong correlation with the observed trend in glass-transition temperature, suggesting its potential as a predictive descriptor for polymer network behavior. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into how epoxy resin composition modulates network structure and thermomechanical properties.</p>

            <h2>Correlated electronic structure of high-temperature superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+Î´}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Xuan Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Cuprate superconductors have attracted extensive attention due to high critical temperatures. Conventional cuprates typically contain perfect CuO$_2$ planes which are considered as a key factor to superconductivity since the superconductivity takes place in them. However, in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ with $\delta=0.2$ and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes, superconductivity still arises even with a transition temperature as high as 73 K. Using combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we investigated the electronic correlation and electronic structure of Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.25}$ with alternating quasi-one-dimensional (1D) CuO planes and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes. We find that although different from the usual cuprates, the Cu atoms are still dominated by a 3$d^9$ configuration and the system is of a new kind of correlated single-orbital physics. The quasi-1D CuO planes, composed of parallel Cu-O chains, are slightly hole-doped quasi-1D Mott insulator, while the O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes are more hole doped, with a 2D correlated electronic structure, and may host superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Timescales for stochastic barrier crossing: inferring the potential from nonequilibrium data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. J. Archer, T. Ala-Nissila, T. J. W. Honour, S. P. Fitzgerald</p>
            <p>Kramers' rate theory forms a cornerstone for thermally activated barrier crossing. However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on obtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium. Instead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system of a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a double-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path integral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key timescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE and SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a well at time $t \ll \tau_{\rm B}$, where $\tau_{\rm B}$ is the Brownian diffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point appears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t \lessapprox \tau_{\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential well can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly, this timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant deviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \gg \tau_{\rm B}$. We further calculate \red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric potentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory at a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height. Our results have important implications for controlling activated processes at finite times and demonstrate the importance of reaching long enough times to faithfully construct potential landscapes from experimental or simulation data.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao</p>
            <p>We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.</p>

            <h2>High temperature modulations, meso-scale interactions and hyperscaling breakdown in Ising models with frustration: some insights from thermodynamic geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumen Khatua, Riekshika Sanwari, Vikram Patil, Anurag Sahay</p>
            <p>In this work we revisit the Axial Third Nearest Neighbour Ising (A3NNI) chain and examine in detail some aspects of its phase behaviour ensuing from competing interactions and resulting frustration. We probe the phase behaviour with two complimentary tools: a microscopic two-point correlation function $\mathcal{C}(n)$ which we carefully construct after appropriate spin transformations, and a macroscopic, thermodynamic curvature $R$ which we obtain from the free entropy. We report novel observations of phenomena such as hyperscaling breakdown and intermediate-ranged modulations among others. The zero field thermodynamic curvature $R_0$ is shown to systematically sub-divide the ground state phases into regions of attractive or repulsive effective interactions of varying strength. Furthermore, $R_0$ brings forth the significance of some third order moments in describing the effects of frustration, including the multiphase lines. Combined use of both the probes in the short-ranged modulated order regime confirms and further clarifies the discussion in [1] regarding the appropriate measure of high temperature correlation length in this regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SebastiÃ¡n Alberti, Thierry Brotin, Jana JÃ¡gerskÃ¡</p>
            <p>Since the affinity of Cryptophane-A for methane was first reported in 1993, cryptophane-doped polymer films have been extensively studied as enrichment cladding layers in plasmonic, fiber-optic, and integrated waveguide-based optical sensors. While the use of cryptophane-doped layers has improved methane sensitivity compared to undoped claddings, controversy has grown over the years regarding their claimed selectivity and practical applicability. Key questions remain unresolved, including the extent of true methane enrichment at room temperature, cross-sensitivity to other gases, and the proportion of active cryptophane molecules within the polymer matrix. In this work, we employ Raman spectroscopy to provide direct and unambiguous evidence that Cryptophane-A exhibits measurable affinity for major ambient gases other than methane at room temperature. Notably, both nitrogen and carbon dioxide are shown to enter the cryptophane cavity and compete with methane for binding sites. This study underscores the value of Raman spectroscopy as a benchmark technique for investigating gas capture within host molecules at ambient conditions. It offers deeper insight into the binding behavior of Cryptophane-A and enables quantification of its relative affinities to atmospheric gases, thereby revealing both the limitations and the potential of cryptophane for future sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Spectral Feature Extraction for Robust Network Intrusion Detection Using MFCCs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HyeYoung Lee, Muhammad Nadeem, Pavel Tsoi</p>
            <p>The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks. Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Relations, Morphological Stability, and Asymptotic Freedom of Plasma-Surface Deposition Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Saucedo, Uday Lamba, Hasitha Mahabaduge</p>
            <p>Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure remains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely confined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop a predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG) analysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the plasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles. The central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic freedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the growing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales, a finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of continuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG framework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area, $\langle A \rangle \propto \exp(\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by fundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\Phi$) and ion collision time ($\tau_{\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed empirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to specific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable predictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within collision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\Lambda_c = 1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on crystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine for predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer RÃ©nyi Entropy Encodes Fusion Rules of Topological Defects and Boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Hoshino, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the stabilizer RÃ©nyi entropy (SRE), a computable measure of quantum magic, can serve as an information-theoretic probe for universal properties associated with conformal defects in one-dimensional quantum critical systems. Using boundary conformal field theory, we show that open boundaries manifest as a universal logarithmic correction to the SRE, whereas topological defects yield a universal size-independent term. When multiple defects are present, we find that the universal terms in the SRE faithfully reflect the defect-fusion rules that define noninvertible symmetry algebra. These analytical predictions are corroborated by numerical calculations of the Ising model, where boundaries and topological defects are described by Cardy states and Verlinde lines, respectively.</p>

            <p>Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</p>

            <p>We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems. Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to describe subtle quantum behaviors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Finocchiaro, Giovanni Luilli, Giuliano Benenti, Matteo G. A. Paris, Luca Razzoli</p>
            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <h2>Unifying Chemical and Electrochemical Thermodynamics of Electrodes</h2>

            <p>Batteries are critical for electrified transportation and aviation, yet thermodynamic understanding of electrode materials remains lacking, as indicated by the often-seen violation of the second law of thermodynamics of open-circuit voltage (OCV) models. On the other hand, thermodynamic modeling rarely utilizes electrochemical data such as OCV, entropic heat (dOCV/dT), which contains rich thermodynamic information. This work introduces a framework of thermodynamic modeling of materials for electrochemical energy storage, using differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization of thermodynamic parameters. Using a modified Debye model that accounts for the phonon density of states, the thermodynamics of pure substances is modeled from experimental measurements of specific heat ($c_p$) as well as the phonon density of states $g(\omega)$. Thermodynamics of mixing is modeled with measured entropic heat and OCV data. We demonstrate the differentiable thermodynamic modeling framework with forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, i.e. determining phase diagram of graphite anode given thermochemical and electrochemical data, we show that in addition to accurate reproduction of phase diagram of LixC6, the fitted temperature-dependent OCV of graphite reaches 3.8 mV mean absolute error (MAE) for test set data measured at 10$^\circ$C, compared with 2.9-3.6 mV MAE for training set data measured at 25$^\circ$C - 57$^\circ$C. In the inverse problem, i.e. determining OCV of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode from phase diagram constrained by thermochemical and electrochemical data, we demonstrate accurate reproduction of LFP OCV as well as phase diagram. This framework offers a unified treatment of chemical and electrochemical thermodynamic data for electrode materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Wang, Zhi-Cheng Yang, Tianci Zhou, Xiao Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional random free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that can exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the Stabilizer RÃ©nyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect sampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the system transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase, the structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This transition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information, which exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic scaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase. Additionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes extensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation time to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic random circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation time that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for the critical nature of the phase.</p>

            <h2>Disordered pinning models with contact number constraint</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giambattista Giacomin, Marco Zamparo</p>
            <p>Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called \emph{contacts}. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this \emph{big jump phenomenon} is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</p>

This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</p>

Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.</p>

            <p>Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst</p>
            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

            <h2>Temporal Brewster anomaly and collimated wave steering in Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>Temporal disorder-random temporal fluctuations of material parameters-has recently emerged as an effective tool for controlling wave propagation, analogous to Anderson localization in spatially disordered systems. Here, we theoretically introduce and analyze the temporal Brewster anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems, demonstrating that Dirac waves remain delocalized along a vector potential with fixed direction despite random temporal variations in its magnitude. In contrast, waves propagating at any off-axis angle exhibit pronounced spatial localization and diffusive behavior. This directional selectivity arises from temporal impedance matching, previously identified as the mechanism suppressing temporal reflection along the vector potential axis. By analyzing temporal reflectance, wave group velocity, and pulse propagation, we establish that these systems function as dynamic directional filters, achieving collimated wave steering purely through temporal modulation. In Dirac materials, external electric fields or mechanical strain can dynamically control the orientation and strength of the vector potential modulation, enabling precise, real-time tuning of directional wave transmission. The temporal Brewster anomaly thus offers a robust and versatile approach for adaptive wave steering, promising significant technological applications in electronic and photonic devices.</p>

We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic waves in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, exponential behavior at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields true log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated by extensive calculations using two complementary disorder models-delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations-demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry and temporal dynamics. Momentum conservation further constrains long-term behavior, linking initial conditions to energy growth. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.</p>

            <h2>Topological edge states and disorder robustness in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ba Phi Nguyen, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa>1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations reveal that these edge states exhibit robust localization and characteristic nodal structures, with their properties strongly dependent on the edge configurations of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states (emerging for $\kappa \ge 4$) are fragile and disappear under strong disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion in the post-Newtonian approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilberto M. Kremer</p>
            <p>A mixture of light-gas particles and Brownian heavy particles is analyzed within the framework of a post-Newtonian Boltzmann equation to determine the Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion. For each species, the equilibrium distribution function refers to the corresponding post-Newtonian Maxwell-JÃ¼ttner distribution function. The expressions for the friction viscous coefficient in the first and second post-Newtonian approximations are determined, and we show their dependence on the corresponding gravitational potentials. A linear stability analysis in the Newtonian and post-Newtonian Fokker-Planck equations for the Brownian motion is developed, where the perturbations are assumed to be plane harmonic waves of small amplitudes. From a dispersion relation it follows that: (i) for perturbation wavelengths smaller than the Jeans wavelength two propagating modes -- corresponding to harmonic waves in opposite directions -- and one mode that does not propagate show up; (ii) for perturbation wavelengths bigger than the Jeans wavelength the time evolution of the perturbation corresponds to a growth or a decay and the one which grows refers to the instability.</p>

            <h2>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Davoodi</p>
            <p>Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double NÃ©el ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</p>

            <h2>Mesoscopic Fluctuations and Multifractality at and across Measurement-Induced Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Poboiko, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin</p>
            <p>We explore statistical fluctuations over the ensemble of quantum trajectories in a model of two-dimensional free fermions subject to projective monitoring of local charge across the measurement-induced phase transition. Our observables are the particle-number covariance between spatially separated regions, $G_{AB}$, and the two-point density correlation function, $\mathcal{C}(r)$. Our results exhibit a remarkable analogy to Anderson localization, with $G_{AB}$ corresponding to two-terminal conductance and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ to two-point conductance, albeit with different replica limit and unconventional symmetry class, geometry, and boundary conditions. In the delocalized phase, $G_{AB}$ exhibits ``universal'', nearly Gaussian, fluctuations with variance of order unity. In the localized phase, we find a broad distribution of $G_{AB}$ with $\overline{-\ln G_{AB}} \sim L $ (where $L$ is the system size) and the variance $\mathrm{var}(\ln G_{AB}) \sim L^\mu$, and similarly for $\mathcal{C}(r)$, with $\mu \approx 0.5$. At the transition point, the distribution function of $G_{AB}$ becomes scale-invariant and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ exhibits multifractal statistics, $\overline{\mathcal{C}^{q}(r)}\sim r^{-q(d+1) - \Delta_{q}}$. We characterize the spectrum of multifractal dimensions $\Delta_q$. Our findings lay the groundwork for mesoscopic theory of monitored systems, paving the way for various extensions.</p>
