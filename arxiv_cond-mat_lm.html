            <h2>Swimming against a superfluid flow: Self-propulsion via vortex-antivortex shedding in a quantum fluid of light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Tiago D. Ferreira, Alberto Bramati, Mathias Albert, Pierre-Élie Larré, Quentin Glorieux</p>
            <p>A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.</p>

            <h2>Gate-Tunable Superconducting Spin Valve in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Superconductor/Ferromagnet Trilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. S. Ianovskaia, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I.V. Bobkova</p>
            <p>We theoretically demonstrate a gate-tunable superconducting spin valve effect (SVE) in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure composed of a monolayer superconductor (S) sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (F) monolayers (F/S/F). By electrostatically gating the ferromagnetic layers to modulate their chemical potentials, the system can be continuously tuned between the standard, inverse and triplet (non-monotonic) SVE regimes within the same device. This tunability originates from the gate-controlled hybridization between the superconducting and ferromagnetic electronic spectra, which determines the effective exchange field induced in the S-layer. Furthermore, we reveal that gating enables exotic, non-BCS temperature dependencies of the superconducting order parameter, including reentrant superconductivity, bistable states, first-order phase transitions, and the emergence of superconductivity at finite temperatures. Our results establish vdW F/S/F trilayers as a versatile and highly controllable platform for superconducting spintronics, where external gate voltages can selectively activate different spin-valve functionalities and unconventional superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>Magnetochiral eigenstate of the Heisenberg chain with spontaneous symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tigran A. Sedrakyan, Junjun Pang, Chenan Wei, Baigeng Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a protocol to construct atypical high-energy eigenstates in quantum systems by using ground states of Hamiltonians deformed by conserved charges. For the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain we study a chiral Hamiltonian built from the scalar-chirality charge and total magnetization and solve it exactly by Bethe ansatz. Its ground state is a magnetized, current-carrying XXX eigenstate that breaks SU(2), time-reversal, and parity yet stays critical. This zero-entropy macrostate shows ballistic spin and chirality transport and admits realistic cold-atom and Rydberg platforms.</p>

            <h2>Skyrmion Sliding Switch in a 90-nm-Wide Nanostructured Chiral Magnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Weiwei Wang, Lingyao Kong, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Jin Tang</p>
            <p>Magnetic skyrmions, renowned for their fascinating electromagnetic properties, hold potential for next-generation topological spintronic devices. Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Current-controlled creations, deletions, and topological transformations of a single magnetic antiskyrmion in nanostructured cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Lingyao Kong, Wei Liu, Huanhuan Zhang, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Jin Tang</p>
            <p>Topological magnetic solitons have emerged as promising candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices, thanks to their fascinating electromagnetic properties. For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating. Our results hold potential for advancing antiskyrmion-based device applications.</p>

            <h2>Predicting tunable nonreciprocal spin wave generation mediated by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnonic heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cameron A McEleney, Karen L Livesey, Robert E Camley, Rair Macêdo</p>
            <p>Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called "overlap function" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region.</p>

            <h2>Bulk superconductivity in the kagome metal YRu3B2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobi Gaggl, Ryo Misawa, Markus Kriener, Yuki Tanaka, Rinsuke Yamada, Max Hirschberger</p>
            <p>Materials with a kagome sublattice have been heavily studied recently for their exotic electronic band structure, structural frustration, high-temperature charge order transitions, and unconventional electron-phonon coupling. In LaRu3Si2, it was proposed that electronic flat bands conspire with the characteristic phonon spectrum of the kagome lattice to drive enhanced superconductivity at Tc = 7 K. Here, we report bulk superconductivity in the structural analogue YRu3B2, which hosts a structurally pristine kagome lattice. We observe a superconducting transition at Tc = 0.7 K through magnetization, resistivity, and heat-capacity measurements in this novel kagome metal.</p>

            <h2>Low-dimensionality-induced tunable ferromagnetism in SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinyoung Kim, Minjae Kim, Donghan Kim, Sungsoo Hahn, Younsik Kim, Minsoo Kim, Byungmin Sohn, Changyoung Kim</p>
            <p>Quantum materials near electronic or magnetic phase boundaries exhibit enhanced tunability, as their emergent properties become highly sensitive to external perturbations. Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-driven giant magneto-optical Kerr effects in altermagnet hematite</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Luo, Xiaodong Zhou, Jinxuan Liang, Ledong Wang, Qiuyun Zhou, Yong Jiang, Wenhong Wang, Yugui Yao, Luyi Yang, Wanjun Jiang</p>
            <p>Altermagnets have attracted tremendous interest for revealing intriguing physics and promising spintronics applications. In contrast to conventional antiferromagnets, altermagnets break both PT and Tt symmetries, and simultaneously exhibit spin-split band structures with a vanishing net magnetization. To quantify insulating altermagnets without conduction electron, we propose to use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) to identify the altermagnetic fingerprints. In particular, we demonstrate not only the giant MOKE responses, but also their connection with the orientations of Neel vectors at room temperature in altermagnet hematite alpha-Fe_2O_3. Specifically, under the Neel vector along the [1-100] axis, we find a giant polar Kerr rotation angle 93.4 mdeg in the (11-20) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2'/c'. Under the Neel vector along the [11-20] axis, we find a longitudinal Kerr angle 9.6 mdeg in the (0001) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2/c. Further, we show that such pronounced MOKE effects directly enable an optical imaging of altermagnetic domains, together with their reversible domain wall (DW) motion. Our studies not only suggest MOKE can be used to identify altermagnet candidates, but also signify the feasibility of exploring altermagnetic optical and DW spintronics, which could largely expand the current research paradigm of altermagnetism.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke</p>
            <p>This study establishes a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings. We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of strain-mediated control in three-dimensional magnetic systems, demonstrating its feasibility for energy-efficient spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Single particle dynamical signature of topology induced by single mode cavities in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Pavan, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni</p>
            <p>Witnessing and tracking topological phase transitions induced by interactions with the environment is a crucial challenge. Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology.</p>

            <h2>Domain Wall Control of Topological Qubits in the Kitaev SSH Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Heron Caldas</p>
            <p>Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of $γ$-Belite(010)-Water Interfaces with High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernadeta Prus, Jörg Behler</p>
            <p>Belite -- dicalcium silicate Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ -- is a main constituent of low-carbon cement. In this work, we study several terminations of the (010) surface of $\gamma$-belite, its most stable polymorph, by molecular dynamics simulations. The energies and forces are provided by a high-dimensional neural network potential trained to density functional theory data. Water can interact in molecular form as well as dissociatively with the investigated interfaces, and the degree of dissociation is determined primarily by the protonation of SiO$_4$ groups accessible at the surface. A major part of the simultaneously formed hydroxide ions is adsorbed at surface calcium atoms, whose octahedral coordination spheres are completed by additional water molecules. The T3 termination, which is most stable in vacuum, shows only little reactivity in water. For the only slightly less stable T2 termination, however, two distinct types of surface defects are observed. The type I defect is even stable in vacuum and leads to a reconstruction of the entire surface, while the type II defect is only found in the presence of water. Overall, our results suggest that a variety of structures may be formed at the Ca$_2$SiO$_4$(010) surface, which are stabilized in the presence of water.</p>

            <h2>Burgers equation from non-thermal stationary states in nearly-integrable gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paweł Lisiak, Maciej Łebek, Miłosz Panfil</p>
            <p>When a gas of particles interacts with much a larger reservoir the dynamics of density on large scales is typically governed by diffusion. We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture is altered when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states. Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear Euler-scale coupling of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions, which we call velocity swap models. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath.</p>

            <h2>Dimensional crossover and finite-range effects in a quasi-two-dimensional gas of fermionic dimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Midei, Jordi Boronat, Grigory E. Astrakharchik</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state properties of ultracold two-component Fermi gases in the presence of a transverse harmonic potential, focusing on the strongly interacting regime in which pairs of fermions form tightly bound molecules. Using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate the equation of state and density profiles for the full fermionic system, which allows us to address the importance of finite-range corrections arising from the internal fermionic structure of the composite bosons. We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions. We also develop an analytical theory for the transverse density profile, capturing its broadening with increasing interaction strength. This work provides a benchmark for an effective bosonic description of strongly bound fermionic dimers and offers new insights into the three- to two-dimensional crossover.</p>

The as-grown sample S1 exhibits characteristics typical of optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals containing twins and twin boundaries. Analysis of both FLC and PG showed an unexpected improvement in all characteristics of the sample after 6 years of storage (sample S2), indicating that the effect of twin boundaries is somehow limited. After 17 years of storage, all characteristics of the sample changed dramatically, which indicates a strong influence of internal defects formed during the aging process. For the first time, the temperature dependences of both FLC and PG were obtained after 17 years of storage.</p>

            <h2>The Impact of Magnons, Defects, and Rapid Energy Migration on the Optical Properties of the 2D Magnet CrPS4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob T. Baillie, Eden Tzanetopoulos, Rachel T. Smith, Remi Beaulac, Daniel R. Gamelin</p>
            <p>Strong coupling between optical and magnetic excitations could enable contactless, spatially resolved, or ultrafast interrogation and control of magnetism two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices. The layered 2D A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4 stands out among van der Waals (vdW) magnets for its rich optical fine structure, but its spectroscopy is not yet understood and has so far been interpreted without consideration of magnetic exchange. Here, we show that this fine structure comes primarily from exchange-mediated coupling between on-site optical "spin-flip" transitions of Cr3+ and low-energy spin transitions involving the surrounding lattice. Well-resolved magnon sidebands to optical 4A2 <--> 2E transitions are observed in photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation spectra, as well as a pronounced PL sideband due to short-range exchange splitting. Energy migration is probed using Yb3+ dopants as traps, revealing sub-picosecond inter-site excitation hopping. Formation of dispersive Frenkel excitons of coupled on-site d-d transitions due to inter-site exchange is discussed. In addition to impacting how optical fine structure is interpreted in this and potentially other vdW magnets, these findings may have ramifications for future applications of layered 2D magnets by revealing new opportunities to drive mode-specific spin-wave excitations using light.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and geometric superfluid weight of a tunable flat band system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Mojarro, Sergio E. Ulloa</p>
            <p>We study superconductivity and superfluid weight of the two-dimensional $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice with on-site asymmetries, hosting an isolated quasi-flat band with tunable bandwidth via a parameter $\alpha$. Within a mean-field approximation of the attractive Hubbard model, we obtain the superconducting order parameters on the three inequivalent sublattices and show their strong dependence on $\alpha$, interaction strength, and electron filling. At quasi-flat band filling, a superconducting gap opens and grows power-law fast with interaction strength, instead of the usual slow exponential growth, due to diverging density of states. We calculate the superfluid weight from linear response theory and study its band dispersion and geometric contributions. While the conventional part proportional to band derivatives is suppressed in the quasi-flat band regime, the contribution dominated by the quantum metric grows linearly for small interaction strength. We further demonstrate how tuning $\alpha$ enhances the quantum metric and thus the geometric superfluid weight especially near half-filling, while increasing on-site asymmetries increases the conventional contribution by broadening the quasi-flat band. We obtain the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence and enhancement with the parameter $\alpha$. Our results establish a tunable flat band system, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice model, as a candidate for tunable quantum geometry and superfluid weight and as a prototype of related behavior in tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Kahan, Pablo Viñas, Torsten V. Zache, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</p>

            <h2>Slow dynamics and magnon bound states in the 2D long-range quantum Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vighnesh Dattatraya Naik, Markus Heyl</p>
            <p>The dynamics of long-range quantum Ising models represents a current frontier in experimental physics, notably in trapped ions or Rydberg atomic systems. However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems.</p>

            <p>The landscape of two-dimensional photonics has been dominated by van der Waals (vdW) materials. Expanding this library to include non-vdW layered systems promises enhanced environmental robustness and access to novel functionalities, such as strong ionic conductivity, yet their exfoliation remains challenging. Here, we establish Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO), a P2-type superionic conductor, as an exfoliable non-vdW optical material. We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The lattice dynamics, probed by temperature-resolved Raman spectroscopy, underscore the rigidity of the [Zn2TeO6]2- framework, which remains largely decoupled from the high ionic mobility. These results identify NZTO as a compelling platform for robust, anisotropic dielectric photonics, simultaneously opening a pathway toward the convergence of ionic transport and optical control - an emerging paradigm we term iono-photonics.</p>

            <h2>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Galen J. Wilkerson</p>
            <p>Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Data Extraction from Materials Science Literature: A Study of Tools Using Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenkai Ning, Musen Li, Jeffrey R. Reimers, Rika Kobayashi</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for large-scale extraction and organization of unstructured data owing to their exceptional Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. Empowering materials design, vast amounts of data from experiments and simulations are scattered across numerous scientific publications, but high-quality experimental databases are scarce. This study considers the effectiveness and practicality of five representative AI tools (ChemDataExtractor, BERT-PSIE, ChatExtract, LangChain, and Kimi) to extract bandgaps from 200 randomly selected Materials Science publications in two presentations (arXiv and publisher versions), comparing the results to those obtained by human processing. Although the integrity of data extraction has not met expectations, encouraging results have been achieved in terms of precision and the ability to eliminate irrelevant papers from human consideration. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and limitations of these tools, offering insights into improving future data extraction techniques for enhanced scientific discovery and innovation. In conjunction with recent research, we provide guidance on feasible improvements for future data extraction methodologies, helping to bridge the gap between unstructured scientific data and structured, actionable databases.</p>

            <h2>Advanced microwave SQUID multiplexer model incorporating readout power effects and Josephson junction inhomogeneities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Neidig, Mathias Wegner, Sebastian Kempf</p>
            <p>We present an advanced model for describing the readout power dependence of the resonance characteristics of a microwave SQUID multiplexer. Our model proves valid for SQUID screening parameters up to $\beta_\mathrm{L}<1$, hence covering the full range of practically relevant design parameters. We demonstrate that our model significantly improves agreement with experimental data compared to the existing models, thereby enabling optimization beyond the previously accessible parameter space. Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters.</p>

            <h2>Quantum error correction via purification using a single auxiliary</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chandrima B. Pushpan, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De, Amit Kumar Pal</p>
            <p>We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enrich quantum physics by extending conventional phase diagrams, enabling novel topological phenomena, and realizing exceptional points with potential applications in quantum sensing. Here, we present an experimental photonic platform capable of simulating a non-unitary quantum walk generated by a peculiar type of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, largely unexplored in the literature. The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Spin excitation continuum to topological magnon crossover and thermal Hall conductivity in Kitaev magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Z. Zhang, Reja H. Wilke, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>There has been great interest in identifying a Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions. In particular, the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the implications of our results to existing and future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling spin excitation continua in classical and quantum magnets using 2D nonlinear spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Z. Zhang, Ciarán Hickey, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\Gamma\Gamma'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. P. Garrido, P. A. Orellana, A. Matos-Abiague</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied. We propose exploiting the extended nature of edge-like MSs as effective interconnects enabling the coupling between topological states in adjacent planar JJs. The impact of electrostatic disorder on the MSs is also analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic-Field and Strain Engineering of Modulated Transverse Transport in Altermagnetic Topological Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuxian Yang, Xiaodong Zhou, Jingming Shi, Shifeng Qian, Xiaotian Wang, Wenhong Wang, Yinwei Li</p>
            <p>Here, we explore the role of inherent altermagnetic topology in transverse transport phenomena (such as crystal/anomalous Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) in several famous altermagnets, including tetragonal \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O (\textit{X} = K, Rb, Cs; \textit{Y} = S, Se, Te), RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, as well as hexagonal CrSb and MnTe. Notably, in \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O, the first experimentally realized layered altermagnets, transverse transport is governed by altermagnetic pseudonodal surfaces, emphasizing the purely topological contributions to transverse transport. Interestingly, we demonstrate that strain engineering and magnetic field, two unique methods for selectively controlling crystal and anomalous transport, can substantially enhance the magnitude of these phenomena while preserving the alternating spin characteristics in both real and momentum space. Moreover, due to the spin symmetry breaking via shear strain, a new magnetic phase, fully compensated ferrimagnetism, with isotropic spin splitting, can be induced. Our findings provide effective strategies not only for manipulating transverse transport in altermagnets but also for controlling magnetic phase transitions, offering valuable insights for their potential applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoyu Wang, Yuxiang Gao, Hongyu Wu, Zhicheng Zhong</p>
            <p>Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD (Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Distillation), which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems, such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</p>

            <p>Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified. In this version, an error in the processing of the HR-EBSD maps of the Si wafer is specified.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avedis Neehus, Achim Rosch, Johannes Knolle, Urban F. P. Seifert</p>
            <p>Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</p>

            <h2>Optically induced magnetic inertia and magnons from non-Markovian extension of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting-Wei Hsu, Zhenyao Fang, Arun Bansil, Qimin Yan</p>
            <p>Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of electrons such as topological insulators and quantum Hall states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or external magnetic field for electron systems.</p>

            <p>Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.</p>

            <p>Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that the generation of a second harmonic voltage under alternating current driving is a necessary and sufficient signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces.</p>

Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the Néel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>By generalizing a class of models recently introduced to account for protracted transients in biological systems, we identify a novel mechanism for hyperuniformity. In this model, competition of particles over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. We show that, in its spatially extended form, this many-particle model exhibits hyperuniform density fluctuations. Through explicit coarse-graining, we develop a hydrodynamic theory that conforms closely with the results of stochastic simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, hyperuniformity arises from the divergence of the interaction range as the system approaches the critical point. These findings may find applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics, and ecology.</p>

            <h2>Néel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Jin Zou, Lipeng Song, Wei Sun, Yiwen Wu, Luyao Zhu, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>Whether a zero-moment antiferromagnet can host an intrinsic half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface remains an open question in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Existing proposals in compensated magnets reach only transport analogues of this limit and do not realize a genuine AFM half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface. Here we show that in two-dimensional altermagnets the Néel-vector orientation acts as an intrinsic knob for magnetic-space-group reduction that lifts the degeneracy between spin sectors. Using Janus monolayer Ta$_2$TeSeO as a realistic and clean platform and combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that rotating the Néel vector first breaks the relevant mirror symmetry, opening a gap in one spin sector of symmetry-related Weyl pairs, and then breaks the residual $C_{2z}$ symmetry, shifting the remaining Weyl cones in opposite energy directions so that a single spin sector retains a Fermi surface at the Fermi level. These two symmetry-lowering steps convert a compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetal into an intrinsic AFM half-metal. The nearly degenerate in-plane magnetic anisotropy then enables reversible switching between the two spin channels using minute strain or weak anisotropic fields. Because this mechanism relies solely on Néel-vector-induced symmetry reduction, it provides a general low-power route to intrinsic half-metallicity in compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kajal Madaan, Guido Roma, Jasurbek Gulomov, Pascal Pochet, Catherine Corbel, Ilja Makkonen</p>
            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</p>

            <h2>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kicheon Kang</p>
            <p>We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</p>

            <p>An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu</p>
            <p>Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Saa, Eduardo Miranda, Francisco Rouxinol</p>
            <p>We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagomé-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics.</p>

We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harini Hapuarachchi, Francesco Campaioli, Jared H Cole, Andrew D Greentree, Qiang Sun</p>
            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</p>

            <p>We derive the far-field and near-field solutions for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</p>

            <h2>F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Decker, Christopher Watson, Junyu Zhou, Yuhao Liu, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li, Gushu Li, Samuel Stein</p>
            <p>Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction. We introduce F2, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data. Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47% and depth by 38% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of 10^(-7). These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation</p>

            <p>We report the experimental observation of vortex leapfrogging in a two-dimensional fluid of light. By imprinting two vortex-antivortex pairs and tracking their real-time evolution through phase-resolved imaging, we observe a dynamics that is accurately described by a point-vortex model with an outward background flow. By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage. These mechanisms advance our understanding of vortex dynamics and dissipation in superfluids.</p>

            <p>Wigner crystals are a paradigmatic form of interaction driven electronic order. A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $\lambda$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Levin, P. M. Ostrovsky</p>
            <p>We study proximity effect in a tunnel junction between a bulk superconductor and a thin disordered ferromagnetic layer on its surface. Cooper pairs penetrating from the superconductor into the ferromagnet tend to destabilize its uniform magnetic order. The competition of this effect and the intrinsic magnetic stiffness of the ferromagnet leads to a second order phase transition between uniform and non-uniform magnetic states. Using the quasiclassical Usadel equation, we derive the Landau functional for this transition and construct the complete phase diagram of the effect. We identify a special point of "resonance" at which the characteristic energy scale of the proximity effect equals the exchange field of the ferromagnet. At this point, the uniform magnetic state is unstable even in the limit of large stiffness. We further explore the parameter regime far beyond the transition and determine the properties of the resulting strongly non-uniform magnetic state.</p>

            <p>The combination of semiconducting properties and synthetically tunable chirality in chiral metal halide semiconductors (CMHS) offer a compelling platform for room temperature control over electronic spin properties, leveraging effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) for the development of new opto-spintronic functionalities. We report room-temperature CISS-induced magnetoresistance (CISS-MR) exceeding 100% for spin valves in a configuration consisting of a ferromagnet (FM), tunneling barrier, and CMHS. The high CISS-MR is attributed to interfacial spin-selective tunneling barrier induced by the chirality, which can produce current dissymmetry factors that surpass the limit imposed by the Jullière model governed by the intrinsic spin polarization of the adjacent FM contact. The CISS-MR exhibits a strong dependence on the CMHS composition, revealing a structure-property relationship between CISS and structural chirality. The observed exceptionally large tunneling MR response differentiates from a subtle anisotropic MR arising from the proximity effect at the FM/CMHS interface in the absence of a tunneling barrier. Our study provides insights into charge-to-spin interconversion in chiral semiconductors, offering materials design principles to control and enhance CISS response and utilize it in functional platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomas J. Escamilla, Chumin Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the quest for high critical-temperature superconductors has increasingly focused on metal and molecular hydrides, which have demonstrated potential for superconductivity at or near room temperature under extremely high pressures. Such hydrides were first proposed by N. W. Ashcroft in 1968, because hydrogen-rich materials possess elevated vibrational frequencies due to the low atomic mass of hydrogen. This article presents a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analysing superconductivity in hydrides, contrasting with the commonly used McMillan-Allen-Dynes parameterized formula. We also analyse effects of the electron-phonon spectral function and the broadening parameters arising from phonon lifetime and sample imperfections on the superconducting critical temperature. Finally, both theoretical approaches are applied to a typical metal hydride superconductor, and the reliability of self-consistent solutions is validated against the experimentally measured critical temperature.</p>

Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.</p>

This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering.

The ground state phase diagram in the dependence on magnetic field and Coulomb interaction shows a spin-up triplet excitonic condensate (EC) with a nonzero Chern number, emerging uniquely away from the topologically trivial singlet and spin-down triplet EC regions. Strong spin-polarized triplet excitonic fluctuations preceding the condensation are further revealed through the signatures of the dynamical excitonic susceptibility spectra.

            <p>We report disorder-mediated first-order linear and higher-order nonlinear (magneto-)transport of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ (TNS) in the charge-density-wave (CDW) regime. CDW transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and carrier density are proportional and inversely proportional to residual resistance ratio of samples, respectively. Such relation helps to understand the unique CDW order therein. High-$T_{CDW}$ TNS exhibits negative first-harmonic magnetoresistance (MR$^{1\omega}$) under a magnetic field ($B$) parallel to the direction of alternating current ($I^{\omega}$), which may arise from the anomalous velocity induced by the Berry curvature of three-dimensional topological bands near the Fermi level. As $T_{CDW}$ drops, a positive-to-negative MR$^{1\omega}$ transition is observed with decreasing perpendicular $B$, which is likely due to the contribution of Zeeman effect on current pathways in the disordered system. Moreover, interestingly, the second-harmonic nonlinear signals are suppressed, while the third-harmonic signals are significant and sensitive to both $B$ and $T_{CDW}$. Such observations, together with scaling analysis, suggest the quantum geometry quadrupole at play and the modulation of disorder on third-order nonlinearity. Our results pave an avenue for tailoring distinct-order magnetoresistive phases in disordered topological materials.</p>

These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</p>

We introduce an framework for identifying the minimal supercells required for an accurate exchange parameter extraction in the FSTE method, significantly reducing computational cost while preserving precision. Our results show that LSTE and FSTE yield nearly identical exchange parameters, whereas the LKAG method reproduces the dominant exchange interactions but exhibits quantitative deviations. A detailed analysis of computational efficiency versus accuracy reveals that the LSTE scheme offers the most favorable balance, establishing a general, reproducible, and scalable workflow for Heisenberg mapping, while the FSTE approach remains the most straightforward for extracting specific exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Effect of thermal fluctuations on topological crossover in the chiral d+id superconducting phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.G. Groshev, A.K. Arzhnikov</p>
            <p>The effect of thermal fluctuations on the temperature dependence of the topological index C1 of the chiral d+id superconducting phase of a two-dimensional single-band model on a triangular lattice is investigated. Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Supercritical-subcritical correspondence, asymmetric effects and antisymmetric corrections near a critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>The second-order phase transitions in the Ising model and liquid-gas systems share a universality class and critical exponents, despite the absence of $Z_2$ symmetry in the liquid-gas Hamiltonian. This discrepancy highlights a central puzzle in critical phenomena: what is the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws? For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci. We verify these predictions using liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same asymmetric scaling framework governs the behavior of higher-order cumulants in the order parameter distribution.</p>

            <h2>Microwave Signature of the Emerging Abrikosov Lattice Above $H_{c2}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Zhou, Zhanghai Chen, A. A. Varlamov, Andreas Glatz, Yuriy Yerin</p>
            <p>The emergence of the Abrikosov lattice in the normal phase of type-II superconducting films when the magnetic field approaches the critical field $H_{c2}$ from above was predicted in Ref.~\cite{GVV2011}. In the quantum fluctuation regime \cite{GL2001} it is characterized by the formation of relatively large (with sizes of order $\xi_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}\sqrt{H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})}$) ``long lived'' (lifetime of order $\tau_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \hbar \Delta^{-1} H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})$) clusters of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs - signatures of developing Abrikosov vortices. We demonstrate that these fluctuation-induced vortex clusters, previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak (only logarithmically singular) contribution to the dc-conductivity, can in fact be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature. By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $\omega_{QF} \sim \hbar^{-1}\Delta(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\hbar^{-1}\Delta $, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase. For niobium, a prototypical type II superconductor, $\omega_{QF}$ lies in the experimentally accessible microwave range, making the effect directly testable with modern microwave spectroscopy.</p>

Such cavities offer a rich playground to investigate anisotropic electron transport due to the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces. In this work, we achieve two things: First, we verify the existence of triangular modes (as predicted by classical ray tracing calculations) in the quantum solutions of closed circular BLG cavities. Then, we explore signatures of said triangular modes in transport through open BLG cavities connected to leads. We show that the triangular symmetry translates into anisotropic transport and present an optimal setup for experimental detection of the triangular modes as well as for controlled modulation of transport in preferred directions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Mocatti, Giovanni Marini, Giulio Volpato, Pierluigi Cudazzo, Matteo Calandra</p>
            <p>We develop a first-principles many-body framework to describe the dynamics of photocarriers and phonons in semiconductors following ultrafast excitation. Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features.</p>

            <p>We study the radiative heat transfer through a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of plasmonic InSb nanoparticles in close vicinity of an InSb substrate. We show how the frequency bands of the in- plane and out-of-plane modes in the chain are deformed by the coupling to the surface waves in the InSb substrate by considering different carrier concentrations. By calculating the Zak phase we show that also in the presence of the substrate there is a topological phase transition and that topologically protected edge modes emerge for finite chains. Finally, we demonstrate the long-range heat transport along the chain due to the coupling to the surface waves of the sample. We find an enhanced heat transfer in the topological non-trivial phase compared to the trivial phase due to the contribution of the edge modes.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ has garnered significant interest due to its high Curie temperature (T$_C$), large saturation magnetization, and complex magnetic behavior arising, in part, from multiple inequivalent iron sites and vacancies. While several aspects of its complex magnetic and structural characteristics have been examined through careful experiments and first principles studies, much of it remains debatable. In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive temperature-dependent Raman spectrum for bulk Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ and in the process reveal an interesting peak shift anomaly at 150 K. We discuss the possible relationship of this Raman anomaly with the anomalous lattice expansion reported earlier for this material at around 110 K. The impact of the anomalous lattice expansion on the magnetic anisotropy in this van der Waals material is also revealed by an isothermal magnetization analysis. These findings will prove crucial for the use of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ in high-performance spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The tunability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) opens opportunities to engineer topological electronic phases, including topological insulators (TIs) and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs)--materials that host in-gap states localized at their edges, hinges, or corners. Here we explore how chemically feasible perturbations can drive triazine-based COFs (CTFs) into topological regimes. Using a tight-binding model on the Honeycomb lattice inspired by the frontier electronic states of CTFs, we show that introducing an effective uniaxial strain--implemented as a modulation of electron hopping on a subset of bonds--can generate a series of distinct topological band structures. This effect can be realized in practice through chemical substitution of linkers along the strained bonds. First-principles calculations demonstrate that replacing biphenyl with pyrene linkers drives a CTF to the brink of a HOTI phase, suggesting a viable route toward topological band-structure engineering in COFs.</p>

Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincaré-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahar Pourandi, P. Christian van der Sande, Igor A. Ostanin, Thomas Weinhart</p>
            <p>This study presents and calibrates a Discrete Element Method (DEM) contact model for wet granular materials in the pendular regime. The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes.</p>

            <h2>Order parameter for non-mean-field spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Castellana</p>
            <p>We propose a novel renormalization group (RG) method for non mean-field models of spin glasses, which leads to the emergence of a novel order parameter. Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation. Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $\nu$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aprem P. Joy, Roman Lange, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.</p>

            <p>Perovskite-inspired materials have emerged as promising candidates for both outdoor and indoor photovoltaic applications owing to their favorable optoelectronic properties and reduced toxicity. Here, we employ the experimentally realized AgBiI$_4$ double salt as a structural prototype and replace Bi$^{3+}$ with In$^{3+}$ to design a novel lead-free halide compound, AgInI$_4$. First-principles calculations predict that AgInI$_4$ is both chemically and dynamically stable, exhibiting a direct band gap of 1.72 eV, comparable to its bismuth analogue. However, its predicted photovoltaic performance, evaluated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency metric, is lower under both solar and LED illumination. This reduction arises primarily from symmetry-forbidden optical transitions and the absence of Bi-derived 6s$^2$ lone-pair states at the valence band maximum. High-throughput screening of the Ag-In-I ternary phase-space reveals several more stable and metastable compounds that fall into two structural families: tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, with characteristic band gaps near 3.0 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Despite multiple synthetic attempts, the predicted AgInI$_4$ phase could not be experimentally realized, underscoring the challenges of stabilizing indium-based halide double salts. While these materials are unlikely to serve as efficient photovoltaic absorbers, their tunable band gaps and stability make them promising candidates for charge transport and other optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Supersolidity, combining superfluid and crystalline orders, has been realized in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates by tuning interatomic interactions. Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties.</p>

            <p>The paper presents a two-phase hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of collective motion in a thin layer of active colloids containing spherical microswimmers. The model accounts for three fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of the active colloid: the random motion of the microswimmers, their mutual collisions, and their interaction with the surrounding fluid phase. The accurate resolution of the characteristic time scales associated with each mechanism is crucial for reproducing the different dynamic modes. The model reproduces two primary modes of motion: Brownian and collective, as well as the transition between them. It is demonstrated that hydrodynamic interactions begin to play a significant role when the microswimmer velocity exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the kinetic energy transferred to the fluid phase is sufficient to generate a noticeable feedback effect on the swimmers' motion. Conversely, a further increase in microswimmers' velocity enhances the role of collisions, causing the system to revert from a collective mode back to a Brownian-like state. A similar transition occurs at higher volume fractions of microswimmers within the colloid.</p>

            <p>Self-propelled particles accumulate on repulsive barriers in so-called active wetting, but the relationship between this process and equilibrium wetting remains unclear. Using an exact (noiseless) hydrodynamic framework for an active lattice gas, we show, using a slit geometry with periodic boundary conditions, that active matter exhibits both fully- and partially-wet states, with a critical wetting transition between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking ratchet current in the partially wet state, leading to departure of the bulk densities from their binodal values and the emergence of a novel dynamical pathway for the full-to-partial wetting transition. We elucidate this modified dynamical pathway using a minimal model. The results, while establishing a direct connection between active and equilibrium wetting, also identify the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.</p>

This combined analysis resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux across the classically frustrated parameter range. In particular, there is a finite range in the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$ in which i) upon the application of the external field, the gapless quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles, and ii) by further increasing the field, two plateaux are clearly obtained at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$. We discuss the experimental importance of the consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have attracted attention as a promising and cost-effective alternative catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes. These findings expand opportunities for future strain engineering, defect engineering, and high-end twist-angle assemblies for hybrid systems combining MoS2 bilayers and rGO.</p>

            <p>Understanding superconductivity emerging from repulsive fermions remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three component repulsive Hubbard model, using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half-filling, the system exhibits density wave ground state due to strong Hubbard repulsions. Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding and exploring unconventional superconductivities in strongly correlated fermionic systems.</p>

            <p>To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues (Q$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures and at high density, the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy 2 (T$_2$ApIR) experiment has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments.</p>

            <h2>Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex V. Plyukhin</p>
            <p>The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF is defined for an equilibrium ensemble, and generally it is not clear how to use it when the system is out of equilibrium and described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position may be canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.</p>

            <h2>An accurate alternative to hybrid functionals for germanium: DFT+$α$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdulgaffar Abdurrazaq, Ruggero Lot, Antoine Jay, Gabriela Herrero-Saboya, Nicolas Richard, Layla Martin-Samos, Anne Hémeryck, Stefano de Gironcoli</p>
            <p>The accuracy of bulk property predictions in density functional theory (DFT) calculations depends on the choice of exchange-correlation functional. While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional systematically overestimates lattice parameters and strongly underestimates electronic band gaps, hybrid functionals such as Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) offer better overall agreement across a broad range of materials. Using germanium as a critical test case, we challenge the ability of both functionals to capture semiconductor properties. Although HSE improves PBE's gap error, it fails to reproduce germanium's correct $\Gamma$-L indirect and $\Gamma$-$\Gamma$ band gaps simultaneously. Noting that the PBE underestimated energy separation between the 4p valence-band maximum and 4s conduction-band minimum causes unphysical $sp$ mixing, we propose DFT+$\alpha$, a semi-empirical correction scheme applied selectively to 4s-like orbitals. For germanium, DFT+$\alpha$ restores the proper ordering and orbital character of the band edges and yields accurate lattice constant, bulk modulus, elastic constants and phonon frequencies at a fraction of hybrid-functional computational cost.</p>

            <p>The low-energy excitations of a two-component repulsive Fermi gas confined to one dimension are linear dispersing spin- and charge-density waves whose respective propagation velocities depend on the strength and sign of their interaction. Quasi-1D fermions with attractive interaction realize the Luther-Emery liquid, which exhibits a rich array of phenomena, many of which are qualitatively different from those exhibited by their repulsive counterpart. We use a Feshbach resonance to access attractive interactions with $^6$Li atoms. We measured the spin and charge dynamic structure factors using Bragg spectroscopy and find that, contrary to repulsive interactions, the spin wave propagates faster than the charge density wave, thus producing an inversion of the classic spin-charge separation. We also find that a small spin polarization strongly suppresses the spin gap in the measured Bragg spectra. Evidence for pairing are a reduction in spin correlations with increasing attraction and RF spectra consistent with an atom/molecule mixture.</p>

            <h2>Low Resistance Non-Alloyed Ohmic Contacts to High Al Composition n-type AlGaN</h2>

            <p>Ohmic contacts to high (>70\%) Al content n-type Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor layers in nitride electronic and photonic devices are typically fabricated by a lift-off process and high temperature ($>700^\circ$C) thermal alloying. These conditions often result in significant structural deformations of the fabricated structures and impose a harsh thermal budget on all other aspects of the device. Here, we report the fabrication of \textit{non-alloyed} \textit{as-deposited} ohmic contacts to 71\% n+AlGaN ($E_\text{g}\sim5.4$~eV) with a free carrier concentration of roughly $7\times 10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and a resistivity of 4 - 5.5 m$\Omega$cm (among the lowest reported for Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N) with linear $I-V$ characteristics and a contact resistivity of $\rho_\text{c}=(4.4\pm1.0)\times10^{-4}$~$\Omega$cm$^2$ (measured at zero voltage). Contacts with this quality are formed by two separate fabrication schemes: (i) metal-first patterning, and (ii) lift-off with an oxygen asher descum prior to metal deposition. Given the low threading dislocation density in the single-crystal AlN substrate used for epitaxy, the smooth morphology of the contacted epitaxial surface, and the non-alloyed nature of the contacts, this contact resistivity is attributed purely to thermionic field emission through the metal-semiconductor junction. Contact resistivity extraction at low current injection enables us to model these results using a thermionic field-emission model of contact resistivity, yielding a barrier height for Ti/Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N of $(0.81\pm0.02)$ eV.</p>

            <p>Transport measurements are a powerful way to probe the electronic structure of quantum materials, but the information they contain is often convoluted. Yet, in particular for simple low-energy fermiologies, and by combining linear and non-linear responses, definite conclusion can be drawn -- such as, for instance, in the case of the circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. Here, we derive the complete DC intrinsic transport response functions up to third order in the applied electric field within Boltzmann theory that hold combined information about quantum geometry and band dispersion. We discuss the responses for multifold fermions at high-symmetry momenta in time-reversal symmetric crystals as well as their reduction by symmetry constraints. We exemplify in detail the cases of space group 213 and space group 199, which realize different multifold fermions, and show under which conditions these low-energy excitations can be differentially addressed through their bulk nonlinear responses, enabling nonlinear valley-tronics.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyin Song, Ziyue Qi, Chen Fang, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng</p>
            <p>Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.</p>

            <h2>Concentrated Monte Carlo sampling for local observables in quantum spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Zhang, Dingzu Wang, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate observables in many-body quantum systems. However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.</p>

            <h2>The effects of H blistering and ELMs on the thermal fatigue cracking of W by strikepoint sweeping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Hargreaves, J. Vernimmen, J. Scholten, T.W Morgan</p>
            <p>Cyclic thermal loads imposed on a W divertor by strikepoint sweeping may induce low-cycle thermal fatigue cracking of its plasma-facing surfaces. This cracking may be accelerated by plasma-material interactions such as H implantation, blistering, fuzz and void formation. Fatigue cracking may also synergise with ELM cracking. To explore these novel forms of environmentally assisted fatigue, FEA modelling was used to design a uniaxial fatigue experiment for Magnum-PSI that represents strikepoint sweeping at 1 Hz across a 100 mm span of a divertor target. Magnum-PSI was used to combine cyclic thermal loading of W with H implantation and two forms of ELM like pre-cracking. Quantitative SEM analysis of fatigue-cracked W revealed that H implantation significantly delayed crack initiation, with preimplanted targets requiring 450-600 cycles before failure compared to 150 cycles for non-implanted samples. This was attributed to hydrogen-induced dislocation pinning, which produces a case-hardening effect that inhibits persistent slip band formation. ELM-like pre-cracking combined with strikepoint sweeping was found to give rise to localised melting and the formation of 30 micromete diameter droplets, caused by thermal isolation of W regions by fatigue cracks. The implications for the fatigue lifetime of tokamak divertors are also discussed.</p>

            <p>Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.</p>

Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</p>

            <h2>F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Decker, Christopher Watson, Junyu Zhou, Yuhao Liu, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li, Gushu Li, Samuel Stein</p>
            <p>Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction. We introduce \textbf{F2}, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data. Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47\% and depth by 38\% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of $10^{-7}$. These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.</p>

By outlining the assumptions and implications of each perspective, we aim to clarify how different modeling strategies connect molecular processes to physiological temperature response curves and to point toward integrative frameworks that can better explain the diversity of biological thermal responses.</p>

            <p>Electron tomography is a powerful tool for understanding the morphology of materials in three dimensions, but conventional reconstruction algorithms typically suffer from missing-wedge artifacts and data misalignment imposed by experimental constraints. Recently proposed supervised machine-learning-enabled reconstruction methods to address these challenges rely on training data and are therefore difficult to generalize across materials systems. We propose a fully self-supervised implicit neural representation (INR) approach using a neural network as a regularizer. Our approach enables fast inline alignment through pose optimization, missing wedge inpainting, and denoising of low dose datasets via model regularization using only a single dataset. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data and show that it produces high-quality tomograms from diverse and information limited datasets. Our results show that INR-based self-supervised reconstructions offer high fidelity reconstructions with minimal user input and preprocessing, and can be readily applied to a wide variety of materials samples and experimental parameters.</p>

            <p>DEAD-box RNA helicases (DDXs) are essential RNA metabolism regulators that typically unwind dsRNA in an ATP-dependent manner. However, recent studies show some DDXs can also unwind dsRNA without ATP, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. Here, we developed HelixTriad coarse-grained RNA model, incorporating Watson-Crick base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatics within a three-bead-per-nucleotide scheme to accurately reproduce experimental RNA melting curves. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that weak, specific DDX3X-dsRNA interactions drive stochastic strand separation without ATP. Free energy analysis revealed that successful unwinding via high-entropy, stand-displacing intermediates. Furthermore, we introduced Entropy-Unet, a deep learning framework for entropy prediction, which corroborated theoretical estimates and uncovered a hierarchical pattern of entropy contributions. Together, our findings suggest that ATP-independent dsRNA unwinding by DDXs is predominantly entropy-driven, offering new mechanistic insights into RNA helicases versatility.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) crystals offer unique opportunities for modern nanophotonic applications owing to their intrinsic anisotropic nature. While most of them exhibit uniaxial anisotropy arising from weak out-of-plane vdW interaction, some of their representative families also exhibit an in-plane biaxial anisotropy. Among the latter, outstand vdW oxochlorides with in-plane axes of a different physical character (metallic or dielectric). Here, we present an accurate dynamics of dielectric permittivity tensor components of vdW MoOCl2 in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (Vis) spectral region partly covering near-infrared (NIR). Addressing its enormously anisotropic optical constants, we focus on another hyperbolicity window of vdW MoOCl2 emerging in the UV spectral region that may potentially unlock rich light-matter interaction effects. Furthermore, we propose an approach towards designing nanoscale handedness preserved Vis light circular polarizers based on twisted helical vdW MoOCl2 heterostructures. Our findings display that vdW MoOCl2 provides a highly promising platform not only for hyperbolic, but also for chiral nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. S. D. Surya Phani Tej, Ganesh Subramanian, V. Shankar</p>
            <p>We analyse the stability of viscoelastic Dean flow (flow of an elastic fluid through a curved two-dimensional channel, driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient) in the absence of fluid inertia. This configuration is well known to exhibit a hoop-stress-driven `purely elastic' instability (referred to henceforth as the hoop-stress mode -- `HSM') on account of the base-flow streamline curvature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the existence and importance of a distinct elastic instability in this flow configuration, which is not driven by hoop-stresses, but instead is a continuation of a novel `centre-mode' (CM) instability recently identified in rectilinear shear flows. We use both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P models to map out parameter regimes in the $W\!i$--$\epsilon$--$\beta$ space where the aforementioned instabilities are present. Here, $W\!i$ is a suitably defined Weissenberg number that characterizes fluid elasticity, $\beta$ is the ratio of solvent to total solution viscosity, and $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the gap (channel) width to the radius of curvature. For FENE-P model, decreasing the finite extensibility parameter $L$ has opposing effects on the HSM and CM instabilities -- stabilising the former, but destabilising the latter. In the dilute solution regime ($\beta > 0.95$), and for realistic values of $L \sim O(100)$, corresponding to polymer molecular weights of $O(10^{5-6})$g/mol, the CM remains the most unstable mode for $\epsilon \leq 0.25$, rendering it potentially relevant to the onset of elastic turbulence in the flow of such polymer solutions through curved channels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gongyi Wang, Yu Zhang, Zihan Huang</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) has become a versatile tool for analyzing anomalous diffusion trajectories, yet most existing pipelines are trained on large collections of simulated data. In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra.</p>

            <h2>Stretching and breaking of particles in compressible random flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dipankar Roy, Marco Martins Afonso, Jason R. Picardo, Dario Vincenzi</p>
            <p>A key feature of turbulent suspensions that involve floating particles on the surface or inertial particles in the bulk is the compressibility of the effective particle-phase velocity field. Little, however, is known about the effects of small-scale flow compressibility on the stretching and breaking of particles. Here, we gain insight into the nature of these effects by studying the deformation of tiny particles in model fluctuating flows. We consider a generic particle with extensional dynamics that are governed by a vector model, which accounts for elasticity, internal viscosity, and non-affine deformation. Applying the dynamical systems approach of Balkovsky, Fouxon & Lebedev (2000), we first obtain general results for the stationary statistics of particle extension in compressible chaotic flows. We then specialize to a time-decorrelated Gaussian random flow and derive an exact solution for the Batchelor regime of the compressible Kraichnan model. We also perform numerical simulations for a time-correlated renewing flow. While straining is suppressed on the average in compressible flows, our results show that large deviations of the strain rate strongly stretch particles and give rise to a power-law distribution of extensions. Extreme straining events are particularly important for stiff particles and, in the examples considered here, give rise to a counter-intuitive effect: stiff particles stretch more and break faster in flows of increasing compressibility. Highly-elastic particles, whose deformation is dictated by the mean straining, stretch less and break slower. Though based on specific random flows, our work shows how compressibility can affect the extensional dynamics of particles by altering the fluctuations of the strain rate, including its large deviations.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kashif Ammar Yasir, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We explore the influence of geometry in the critical behavior of sparse long-range spin models. We examine a model with interactions that can be continuously tuned to induce distinct changes in the metric, topology, and dimensionality of the coupling graph. This underlying geometry acts as the driver of criticality, with structural changes in the graph coinciding with and dictating the phase boundaries. We further discuss how this framework connects naturally to realizations in tweezer arrays with Rydberg excitations. In certain cases, the effective geometry can be incorporated in the layout of atoms in tweezers to realize phase transitions that preserve universal features, simplifying their implementation in near-term experiments.</p>

            <h2>Reducing dislocation defect levels via sub-melt nanosecond pulsed-laser induced densification of diamond</h2>

            <p>Dislocations and polishing-induced defect networks in synthetic diamond generate local strain fields that broaden Raman features and limit optical, thermal, and electronic performance. Sub-melt laser annealing has emerged as a route to repair near-surface defects without graphitization, yet quantitative evidence of densification, defect depletion, and property recovery remains limited. Here, we show that nanosecond pulsed-laser annealing (PLA) can relax dislocation-associated strain in single-crystal CVD diamond by compacting and reorganizing the damaged near-surface region. Single- and two-pulse PLA were applied, and structural evolution was quantified using co-registered ISO 25178 white-light interferometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and cross-sectional STEM with geometric phase analysis (GPA). Across a 5x6 grid(n = 30), responsive regions show large reductions in local slope (Sdq 45-65%), developed area (Sdr 60-90%), height spread (Sp, Sz 30-65%), void volume (Vv 57-60%), and roughness amplitude (Sa, Sq 48-57%), consistent with densification of ~4-6.5 nm. Raman profiling reveals narrowing of the diamond line and improved spectral uniformity to depths of ~2-3 {\mu}m, indicating relaxation of dislocation-mediated strain beyond the compaction layer. STEM-GPA strain maps confirm smoother strain fields, reduced hotspots, and redistribution of localized strain concentrations after PLA. These results show that sub-melt PLA reduces dislocation-driven strain by compacting surface-connected free volume and reorganizing defect networks. The approach provides a scalable path to upgrade industrial-grade diamond including homoepitaxial, heteroepitaxial, and polycrystalline CVD to low-defect, device-ready surfaces relevant to high-power electronics, photonics, and quantum substrates.</p>

            <p>We reconstruct all (2+1)D quantum double models of finite groups from their boundary symmetries through the repeated application of a gauging procedure, extending the existing construction for abelian groups. We employ the recently proposed categorical gauging framework, based on matrix product operators (MPOs), to derive the appropriate gauging procedure for the $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries appearing in our construction and give an explicit description of the dual emergent $G$ symmetry, which is our main technical contribution. Furthermore, we relate the possible gapped boundaries of the quantum double models to the quantum phases of the one-dimensional input state to the iterated gauging procedure. Finally, we propose a gauging procedure for 1-form $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries on a two-dimensional lattice and use it to extend our results to the construction of (3+1)D quantum doubles models through the iterative gauging of (2+1)-dimensional symmetries.</p>

The underlying mode structure is well described by a Jackiw-Rebbi-like continuum theory with Dirac cones and solitonic zero modes in synthetic frequency. Our results establish a simple and experimentally feasible route to non-Hermitian topological amplification, naturally implementable in current quantum technologies such as superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex J. Vargas, Ranjiangshang Ran, Justin C. Burton</p>
            <p>The slow creep of glacial ice plays a key role in sea-level rise, yet its transient deformation remains poorly understood. Glen's flow law, where strain rate is simply a function of stress, cannot predict the time-dependent creep behavior observed in experiments. Here we present a physics-based rheological model that captures all three regimes of transient creep in polycrystalline ice. The key components of the model are a series of Kelvin-Voigt mechanical elements that produce a power-law (Andrade) creep, and a single viscous element with microstructure and stress dependence that represents reorientation in the polycrystalline grains. The interplay between these components produces a minimum in the strain rate at approximately 1% strain, which is a universal but unexplained feature reported in experiments. Due to its transient nature, the model exhibits fractional power-law exponents in the stress dependence of the strain rate minimum, which has been conventionally interpreted as independent physical processes. Taken together, we provide a compact, mechanistic framework for transient ice rheology that generalizes to other polycrystalline materials and can be integrated into constitutive laws for ice-sheet models.</p>

            <p>The ideal glass, a disordered system of particles with zero configurational entropy, cannot be realized through thermal processes. Nevertheless, we present a method for constructing ideal jammed packings of soft spheres, and thus the zero temperature ideal glass, in two dimensions. In line with the predicted properties, these critically jammed packings have high bulk and shear moduli as well as an anomalously high density. While the absence of pressure scaling in the shear moduli of crystalline materials is often attributed to the ordered nature of the particles, we show for the first time that disordered ideal packings also have this feature. We also find that the density of states avoids the low frequency power law scaling famously found in most amorphous materials, these configurations display hyperuniformity, and they melt at unusually high temperatures as compared to conventional packings. In addition to resolving a long-standing mystery, this methodology represents a valuable shortcut in the generation of well-equilibrated glassy systems. The creation of such an ideal packing makes possible a complete exploration and explanation of two dimensional jammed and glassy systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep generative modelling of canonical ensemble with differentiable thermal properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo-Hui Li, Yao-Wen Zhang, Ding Pan</p>
            <p>It is a long-standing challenge to accurately and efficiently compute thermodynamic quantities of many-body systems at thermal equilibrium. The conventional methods, e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo, require many steps to equilibrate. The recently developed deep learning methods can perform direct sampling, but only work at a single trained temperature point and risk biased sampling. Here, we propose a variational method for canonical ensembles with differentiable temperature, which gives thermodynamic quantities as continuous functions of temperature akin to an analytical solution. The proposed method is a general framework that works with any tractable density generative model. At optimal, the model is theoretically guaranteed to be the unbiased Boltzmann distribution. We validated our method by calculating phase transitions in the Ising and XY models, demonstrating that our direct-sampling simulations are as accurate as Markov chain Monte Carlo, but more efficient. Moreover, our differentiable free energy aligns closely with the exact one to the second-order derivative, indicating that the variational model captures the subtle thermal transitions at the phase transitions. This functional dependence on external parameters is a fundamental advancement in combining the exceptional fitting ability of deep learning with rigorous physical analysis.</p>

            <p>Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, we introduce curved neural networks as a class of models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</p>

We show the existence of topologically protected non-propagative modes that localize at dislocations. These in-gap states, coined as {\it magnonic dislocation modes}, are characterized by the $Z_2$ topological invariant that derives from parity symmetry broken induced by sublattice magnetic anisotropy. We uncover that bulk topology existing in the perfect crystal is robust under the influence of lattice defects, which is monitored by the real-space Bott index. It is also revealed that the topology of {magnonic dislocation modes} remains unaffected when bulk topology becomes trivial and is remarkably resilient against magnetic disorder. Our findings point to the intriguing relationship between topological lattice defects and the spectrum of topological spin excitations.</p>

            <p>Vanadium dioxide with metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) that is triggered by heat, current or light is a promising material for modern active THz/mid-IR metasurfaces and all-optical big data processing systems. Multilayer VO2-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO2 properties in VO2/TiO2/Al2O3 films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO2 films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO2 layer thickness in VO2/TiO2 composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO2 lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO2 layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO2 thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO2 lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO2 layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO2 films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO2/V2O5 phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO2 films revealed that VO2/V2O5 ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO2 film to be as low as 800 ns.</p>

            <h2>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suvam Pal, Leonardo Dagdug, Dibakar Ghosh, Denis Boyer, Arnab Pal</p>
            <p>Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</p>

We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning.

By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a fourfold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground-state degeneracies, fractional quasiparticles, nonvanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Steel, traditionally valued for its structural strength, emerges in this study as a remarkable material for exploring novel magnetic phenomena. We investigate how common processing techniques-thermal treatments and mechanical strain-significantly affect the magnetic properties of low-carbon steels (0.05 percent by weight). Our findings show that slow annealing enlarges the grain size, enhancing magnetic susceptibility, while rapid quenching reduces grain size, resulting in a decreased magnetic response. Quenching low-carbon steel produces significant increase in the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries and a rapid spatial variation of local magnetic anisotropy between grains, a feature which is unachievable with mechanical straining even up to the material's ultimate tensile strength. Tensile-straining of low-carbon steel enhances magnetic susceptibility through altered magnetic anisotropy, contrary to the observed decrease of susceptibility in quenched low-carbon steel. Magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic modelling of our data reveal that, the reduced magnetic susceptibility in quenched steel is a result of the presence of intriguing magnetic excitations akin to magnetic vortices. These localized structures act as strong magnetic domain wall pinning centres, causing the observed decrease in magnetic susceptibility in these quenched low-carbon steels. Beyond its established structural utility, low-carbon steel combines mechanical stability with favourable magnetic properties, positioning it as a strong platform for magnetic device applications.</p>

            <p>Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated MD method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated MD simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nosé-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its capability to accelerate MD simulations by several orders of magnitude while maintaining kinetic consistency and good accuracy in predicting long timescale microstructure evolutions of materials. We also provide some preliminary thoughts on theoretical justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kühn</p>
            <p>Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.</p>

            <p>We develop a Fermi liquid theory of $d$-wave altermagnets and apply it to describe their collective excitation spectrum. We predict that in addition to a conventional undamped plasmon mode, where both spin components oscillate in phase, there is an acoustic plasmon (or {\em demon}) mode with out-of-phase spin dynamics. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we reveal a strong dependence of the demon's frequency and spectral weight both on the Landau parameters and on the direction of propagation. Notably, as a function of the propagation angle, we show that the acoustic mode evolves from a {\em hidden state}, which has zero spectral weight in the density excitation spectrum, to a weakly damped propagating demon mode and then (below a critical interaction parameter) to a {\em Fano-demon mixed state}, which is marked by a strong hybridization with particle-hole excitations and a corresponding asymmetric line shape in the structure factor.

            <p>Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.</p>

We further extend our model to moiré superlattices at various commensurate twist angles around two distinct twist centers represented by $C_{3z}$ and $C_{6z}$ of the honeycomb lattice. Our simulations reveal generalized arrangements of plaquette values that correlate with the AA or AB stacking regions across the moiré unit cell. Moreover, we find that, depending on the twist angle, twist center and interlayer coupling, moiré superlattices exhibit to a variety of gapped and gapless spin liquid phases and can also host corner and edge modes. Our results highlight the rich physics in bilayer and twisted bilayer models of exactly solvable quantum spin liquids.</p>

A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90° in one circulation is consistent with a half-Möbius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-Möbius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</p>

Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet is a good candidate to tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to bad behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</p>

            <h2>Physical Constraints on the Rhythmicity of the Biological Clock</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> YeongKyu Lee, Changbong Hyeon</p>
            <p>Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of KaiABC clock is generated from the underlying circuit. The phase diagram in terms of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a narrowly bounded oscillatory phase. As dictated by the cost-precision trade-offs of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations, the presence of intrinsic noise, amplified in small systems, demands higher energy cost to achieve greater rhythmic precision. The cost-minimizing condition giving rise to $\sim$21-hr rhythm is identified close enough to entrain the system to 24-hr environmental signals. An optimal level of intrinsic noise can induce oscillations beyond the Hopf bifurcation, effectively expanding the oscillatory phase. Our study clarifies how the physical factors, such as energy cost, stochastic noise, and regulatory mechanism, contribute to the operation of biological clocks.</p>

            <h2>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone</p>
            <p>We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</p>

            <h2>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle</p>
            <p>We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</p>

            <p>Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. Using our approach, we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</p>

            <p>Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex) represent a widely used class of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), with applications ranging from the purification of various biomolecules such as nucleic acids to the synthesis of protocells. A key feature underlying these applications is the selective accumulation of biomolecules within Dex-rich droplets in an aqueous PEG phase, but the physical origin of this partitioning remains unclear. Entropic interactions were long assumed to be the primary driving force; however, our systematic experiments using DNA of different lengths indicate that entropy alone cannot fully explain the observed behavior. We identify an additional and previously underappreciated contribution from electrostatic interactions: Dex carries a slightly more negative charge than PEG, which drives preferential cation accumulation in the Dex-rich phase. These counterions facilitate the selective partitioning of DNA inside the Dex-rich droplets. This mechanism explains the dependency of DNA uptake in Dex-rich droplets on polymer length and salt concentration. Our findings establish that Donnan-type ion partitioning plays a crucial role in the localization of long nucleic acids in Dex-rich droplets, offering a unified explanation for this long-standing phenomenon. They lay the foundation for designing ATPS-based systems and help elucidate the physicochemical principles of biomolecular partition upon phase separation in cells.</p>

            <p>In this study we have derived an exact framework for the calculation of the heat flux and its spectral decomposition in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for arbitrary many-body potentials. This work addresses several lacks and limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computational study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations for various 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the heat current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD, while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the contribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its dependence on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS code specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily applicable to the vast majority of many-body MD potentials.</p>

            <p>La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO3-$\delta$ is a promising off-stoichiometric metal oxide that undergoes a topotactic perovskite ($\delta$ = 0) to brownmillerite ($\delta$ = 0.5) transition under electrochemical and thermochemical stimuli, with concomitant variations in its electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties. Recent studies on thin-film cycling in electrochemical devices show incomplete reversibility of this transition, with significant acid-etching serving as a degradation mechanism. While earlier investigations examined the protonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation across the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions from universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the energetics and implications of protonation across the transition for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion energies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the transition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is primarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction by inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically favorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting HyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against decomposition into hydroxides among other products. This instability increases with hydrogen content and provides a thermodynamic basis for the acid-etching observed during electrochemical cycling. This work advances the fundamental understanding of protonation in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ and contextualizes experimental observations of related materials in the presence of moisture or H2.</p>

            <h2>Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from geometric-topological response to entanglement-induced mixed-state landscape</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>A growing body of examples reveals that topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in shaping universal properties of quantum matter, as seen in fracton orders with size-dependent topological ground-state degeneracy and in cluster states with spurious topological entanglement entropy. We introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined on \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs) embedded in the bulk, as a direct probe of this intertwinement. By virtually tuning SES dimension, geometry and topology, the subleading components of SEE show sharply distinct geometric and topological responses in cluster states, $\mathbb{Z}_q$ topological orders, and fracton orders. Further viewing the SES reduced density matrix as a mixed state on the SES manifold, we establish an exact correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, distinguishing \textit{strong} from \textit{weak} classes. Nontrivial SEE enforces weak symmetries to act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of strong ones, together forming \textit{transparent composite symmetries} that are robust against finite depth quantum circuits. Due to the presence of transparent patch operators, each $D$-dimensional SES holographically encodes a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order. Thus, SEE simultaneously accesses various forefront directions, providing a unified and versatile nexus linking phenomena previously regarded as distinct.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Petr Vlčák, Šimon Svoboda, Axel van de Walle</p>
            <p>The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS (this http URL), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD), configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic (x > 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x < 0.5) regions.</p>

Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors remain superconducting down to the monolayer limit, enabling the exploration of emergent physical phenomena and functionality driven by reduced dimensionality. Here, we report the characterization of the kinetic inductance of atomically thin NbSe$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals superconductor, using superconducting coplanar waveguides and microwave measurement techniques familiar to circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime. These effects are likely driven by increased surface scattering, multi-band superconductivity, and geometric confinement. Additionally, the self-Kerr nonlinearity of the NbSe$_2$ films ranges from $K/2\pi$ = -0.008 to -14.7 Hz/photon, indicating its strong potential in applications requiring compact, nearly linear, high-inductance superconducting quantum devices and detectors. The fabrication and characterization techniques demonstrated here are extensible to the investigation of other two-dimensional superconductors.</p>

            <h2>A Functional Field Theorem: An Explicit Proof of Axioms and Equations for Applying iSAFT in Polymer Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximo T. Estrada</p>
            <p>Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.</p>

            <p>Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.</p>

We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</p>

            <p>We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$\pi$ transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Mahmoudi</p>
            <p>Predicting the glass-forming ability (GFA) of chemical compositions remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for oxide glasses with broad compositional diversity. Traditional empirical and thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear factors governing vitrification. In this study, we applied two ensemble machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to the glass_ternary_hipt dataset to predict the GFA of ternary oxide glasses directly from composition-derived descriptors. Both models achieved excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.92, MAE < 0.04), confirming that GFA is learnable from compositional features alone. Feature importance analysis revealed that electronegativity variance, atomic size mismatch, and valence electron descriptors are the most influential factors, while cohesive energy and ionic radius provided secondary contributions. These chemically interpretable features align with established theories of glass formation, thereby bridging predictive performance with physical understanding. The novelty of this work lies in systematically extending ML-based predictive modeling to ternary oxide glasses, a class less studied compared to metallic and binary systems. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning not only enables accurate GFA prediction but also provides actionable insights for designing new glass compositions with enhanced stability.</p>

Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 ${\mu}_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $\Theta$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($\Theta$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>Axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum and resulting magnetic moment can couple to magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of phonons in collinear magnets, spanning ferro-, antiferro-, and alter-magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types of magnetic phonons based on symmetry and PAM wave-pattern parity. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from $p$- to $j$-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such alteraxial phonons. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.</p>

            <h2>Correlation length in random MPS and PEPS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cécilia Lancien, David Pérez-García</p>
            <p>Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.</p>

            <p>By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Viscardi, Marcello Dalmonte, Alioscia Hamma, Emanuele Tirrito</p>
            <p>Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mozhdeh Erfanian, Carl D. Slater, Edward James Brambley</p>
            <p>A mathematical model for wire rolling is developed, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Glassiness From Efficient Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We use the existence of efficient, local learning algorithms for energy estimation -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- to prove that finding near-ground states of disordered quantum systems exhibiting a certain topological property is impossible in the average case for Lipschitz quantum algorithms. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including time-$T$ Lindbladian dynamics from an arbitrary initial state, time-$T$ quantum annealing, phase estimation to $T$ bits of precision, and depth-$T$ variational quantum algorithms, whenever $T$ is less than some universal constant times the logarithm of the system size. To achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the overlap gap property (OGP) for quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). We prove that preparing low-energy states of systems which exhibit the QOGP is intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations of their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Inference of a time delay in stochastic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp, Deepak Gupta</p>
            <p>Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</p>

            <h2>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan P. Honda</p>
            <p>Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions; results are shown to be comparable to quasiparticle bound states in gapped Dirac materials. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion field {\psi} becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion field strength. For sufficiently large {\psi} and low velocity, the collision of two m = 1 vortices results in a pseudostable m= 2 bound state that eventually becomes unstable and decays back into two m= 1 vortices. For large {\psi} and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Abraham</p>
            <p>Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</p>

            <p>We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto model of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha < \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</p>

This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Martin H. Müser, B.N.J. Persson</p>
            <p>We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.</p>

            <p>We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</p>

Lett. 120, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</p>

            <p>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters must satisfy two competing requirements: small singlet-triplet energy gaps for thermal upconversion and sufficient spin-orbit coupling for fast reverse intersystem crossing. Predicting these properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96 for $\Delta E_{ST}$. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sampling.

            <p>We investigate the interplay of particle-hole symmetry and sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology by coupling a so-called Chern dartboard insulator (CDI) to a superconductor (SC) via the proximity effect. We dub the hybrid system, and equivalent intrinsically superconducting phases, a \emph{Chern dartboard superconductor} (CDSC). We show that a CDSC can have nontrivial sBZ topology if it arises from a CDI that has an even number of mirror symmetries $n$. On the other hand, particle-hole symmetry constrains a CDSC that arises from an odd-$n$ CDI to have trivial sBZ topology. However, we can circumvent this constraint for $n=1$ by inducing an FFLO-type pairing or shifting the CDI in momentum space, converting the mirror symmetry to a momentum-space nonsymmorphic mirror symmetry. With a superconducting pairing that preserves the (nonsymmorphic) mirror symmetries, even-$n$ CDIs and the shifted $n=1$ CDI can realize the minimal spinless phase that has a trivial total Chern number and nontrivial reduced Chern numbers. With a pairing that breaks the mirror symmetries, the hybrid system can realize phases that have nontrivial total and reduced Chern numbers, expanding the classification of phases that have sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology. We also predict that some types of $n=2$ CDSCs inherit the quantized crystalline response of the $n=2$ CDI, providing experimentalists with a well-defined way to probe the CDSC. Our work motivates further exploration of sBZ topology, bulk topology, and quantized response.</p>

Here we argue that the combined action of electron-electron interactions and an out-of-equilibrium many-body state can produce striking departures from this familiar picture. We demonstrate how nonequilibrium exchange interactions produce a nonequilibrium collective quantum geometry distinct from that of its equilibrium ground state. We find this manifests as an exchange induced nonlinear Hall effect with nonlinear Hall current signals competitive with that of well-known non-interacting mechanisms. This highlights the critical role electron interactions and nonequilibrium states can play in the nonlinear response of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.</p>

            <p>Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ is a self-intercalated vdW system that is of current interest for its room-temperature FM phases and tunable topological properties. Early NPD measurements on the monoclinic phase Cr$_3$Te$_4$ ($x=0.5$) presented evidence for competing FM and AFM phases. Here we apply neutron diffraction to a single crystal of Cr$_{3+\delta}$Te$_4$ with $\delta=-0.10$ and discover that it consists of two distinct monoclinic phases, one with FM order below $T_{\rm C} \approx 321$ K and another that develops AFM order below $T_{\rm N} \approx 86$ K. In contrast, we find that a crystal with $\delta=-0.26$ exhibits only FM order. The single-crystal analysis is complemented by results obtained with NPD, XPD, and TEM measurements on the $\delta=-0.10$ composition. From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\rm C}$ and $T_{\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions. Correlations between the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments with lattice parameter variation demonstrate that the magnetic orders are sensitive to strain, thus explaining why magnetic ordering temperatures and anisotropies can be different between bulk and thin-film samples, when the latter are subject to epitaxial strain. Our results point to the need to investigate the supposed coexistence FM and AFM phases reported elsewhere in the Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ system, such as in the Cr$_5$Te$_8$ phase ($x=0.25$).</p>

            <h2>Angle evolution of the superconducting phase diagram in twisted bilayer WSe2</h2>

            <p>Recent observations of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ have extended the family of moiré superconductors beyond twisted graphene. In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied.</p>

            <h2>Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Li, Yumeng Li, Quan Fu, Yu Wang</p>
            <p>Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deep Mondal, Arka Bandyopadhyay, Atanu Nandy, Debnarayan Jana</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional carbon nitride materials have been the center of attention for their diverse usage in energy harvesting, environmental remediation and nanoelectronic applications. A broad range of utilities with decent synthetic plausibility have made this family a sweet spot to dive into, whereas the underlying analytical aspects are yet to have prominence. Recently, using the machinaries of first principles, we reported a family of six different structures C3NX with a unique dumbbell-shaped morphology, functionalizing the recently synthesized monolayer of C3N. Here we have critically explored the non-trivial topological phases of the semimetallic Dumbbell C3NX sheets and nanoribbons. Spin-orbit coupling induced gap across the Fermi level, its subsequent tuning via an external electric field, portrayal of band inversion from the Berry curvature distribution and the evaluation of topological index using the Wannier charge center (WCC) firmly establishes the traces of topological footprint. The real space decimation scheme and Green function technique evaluate the underlying spectral information with corresponding transport characteristics. Fascinating features of these quasi-1D systems are observed utilizing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where different twisted phases reveal distinct topological signatures even in a low atomic mass system like DB C4N.</p>

            <p>Antiperovskite nitrides with the general formula M$_3$N have attracted significant attention due to their tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 ${\mu}_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $\Theta$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($\Theta$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for pioneering contributions at the intersection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spin-glass physics, underscoring the profound connections between these fields. The topological similarities between ANNs and Ising-type models, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, reveal shared structures that bridge statistical physics and machine learning. In this perspective, we explore how concepts and methods from statistical physics, particularly those related to glassy and disordered systems like spin glasses, are applied to the study and development of ANNs. We discuss the key differences, common features, and deep interconnections between spin glasses and neural networks while highlighting future directions for this interdisciplinary research. Special attention is given to the synergy between spin-glass studies and neural network advancements and the challenges that remain in statistical physics for ANNs. Finally, we examine the transformative role that quantum computing could play in addressing these challenges and propelling this research frontier forward.</p>

            <p>We address that a single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on a self-similar corral substrate can give rise to a set of non-diffusive localized modes that follow the same hierarchical distribution. As the lattice, the spatial extent of quantum prison containing a cluster of atomic sites is dependent on the generation of fractal structure. Apart from the quantum imprisonment of the excitation, a magnetic flux threading each elementary plaquette is shown to destroy the boundedness and generate an absolutely continuous sub-band populated by resonant eigen functions. Flux induced engineering of quantum states is corroborated through the evaluation of inverse participation ratio and quantum transport. Moreover, the robustness of the extended states has been checked in presence of diagonal disorder and off-diagonal anisotropy. Flux modulated single-particle mobility edge is characterized through mutlifractal analysis. Quantum interference is the essential issue, reported here, that manipulates the kinematics of the excitation and this is manifested by the workout of persistent current.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) quartic dispersion materials are known to develop magnetization upon doping. Here we conduct a systematic investigation of magnetization in hole-doped quartic dispersion materials (GaS, InSe, TiO$_{2}$), focusing on the effects of structural confinement from 2D monolayers to quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons (NRs). Upon hole doping, these NRs develop itinerant magnetization across a broad range of carrier densities and display half-metallic behavior. The spin-polarization energies ($E_{sp}$) of these NRs enhance remarkably relative to their 2D counterparts, with maximum increase being in the case of TiO$_{2}$ from 31 to 103 meV/carrier. The $E_{sp}$ strongly depends on the degree of localization of the magnetic moments along the width of NRs, which is determined by edge passivation and ribbon width. Strong deformation of the topmost valence bands at higher dopings indicates deviation from the Stoner mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Compression-driven jamming in porous cohesive aggregates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sota Arakawa</p>
            <p>I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\phi_{\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\phi_{\rm J} = 0.765 \pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\phi_{\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \approx A {( \phi - \phi_{\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks.</p>

Representative case studies demonstrate breakthrough applications in flexible/ultrathin electronics, ultrahigh-sensitivity sensors and the exploration of novel quantum states.

            <p>Flexible electronics and neuromorphic computing face key challenges in material integration and function retention. In particular, freestanding membranes suffer from slow sacrificial layer removal and interfacial strain, while neuromorphic hardware often relies on area-intensive dual-device schemes for bipolar synaptic weights. Here, we present a universal strategy based on water-soluble Sr4Al2O7 sacrificial layers, enabling the rapid release of freestanding ferrimagnetic metal membranes, which exhibit deterministic spin-orbit torque switching characteristics with well-preserved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and are potential for next-generation ultrafast information technology. Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching. When implemented in a ResNet-18 architecture, these devices achieve 92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 - comparable to floating-point software models - while halving device counts relative to differential-pair implementations. These results establish a scalable platform linking flexible spintronics with compact, high-performance neuromorphic systems, offering foundational advances for next-generation electronics and brain-inspired hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aashna Chawla, Deepak Kumar</p>
            <p>In our common experience, crumpling a sheet requires external compressive force and leads to a random network of folds. However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets.</p>

            <p>Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of the electron spin resonance of topological defects (edge state) in dimerized chains. These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials.</p>

            <p>The mechanical tension at the interface of motility-induced phase separating active Brownian particles (ABPs) remains an open question. Here, we determine the surface tension by analyzing the spatial distribution of forces at the molecular level in a slab-confined system of ABPs exhibiting high and low density regions separated by a one-dimensional active interface. Unlike previous approaches that evaluate active and interaction stresses independently - often producing near-zero or negative surface tension - we show that on average, interaction forces act antagonistically to active propulsion, reducing the net force experienced by particles. By evaluating the work required to bring a particle to the interface using this total-force framework, we find a positive and physically consistent surface tension. These results reframe the mechanical interpretation of local stresses and provide a generalizable method for connecting microscopic force distributions to emergent interfacial properties in nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>We report the synthesis of nanocrystal heterostructures composed of CsPbCl3 and PbS domains sharing an epitaxial interface. We were able to promote the growth of a PbS domain (in competition with the more commonly observed Pb4S3Cl2 one) on top of the CsPbCl3 domain by employing Mn2$^+$ ions, the latter acting most likely as scavengers of Cl$^-$ ions. Complete suppression of the Pb4S3Cl2 domain growth was then achieved by additionally selecting an appropriate sulfur source (bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, which also acted as scavenger of Cl$^-$ ions), and reaction temperature. In the heterostructures, emission from the perovskite domain was quenched, while emission from the PbS domain was observed, pointing to a type-I band alignment, as confirmed by calculations. These heterostructures in turn could be exploited to prepare second-generation heterostructures through selective ion exchange on the individual domains (halide ion exchange on CsPbCl3, cation exchange on PbS). We demonstrate the cases of Cl$^-$ to Br$^-$ and Pb2$^+$ to Cu$^+$ exchanges, which deliver CsPbBr3@PbS and CsPbCl3@Cu2-xS epitaxial heterostructures, respectively.</p>

            <p>Halide exchange in lead-based halide perovskites has been studied extensively. While mixed Cl-Br or Br-I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl-I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl and I ionic radii. Here, we exploit perovskite-chalcohalide CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures to study the Cl-I exchange and isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type-I, with carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu</p>
            <p>Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sushovan Sarkar, Koushik Gayen, Ashish Soni, Suman Kalyan Pal</p>
            <p>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature.</p>

            <p>Near-Infrared (NIR) light emitting metal halides are emerging as a new generation of optical materials owing to their appealing features, which include low-cost synthesis, solution processability and adjustable optical properties. NIR emitting perovskite-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, we summarize several different types of NIR-emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, and assess their recent advancements. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow-band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. We also highlight the various applications of NIR-emitting metal halides and provide an outlook for the field.</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Boundaries of the Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor with Ethylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Nanocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Meric Guvenc, Stefano Toso, Yurii P. Ivanov, Gabriele Saleh, Sinan Balci, Giorgio Divitini, Liberato Manna</p>
            <p>We report the synthesis of ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) colloidal nanocrystals as another member of the lead halide perovskites family. The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions.</p>

            <p>Harvesting low-grade heat to electricity is attractive for powering wearable electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate nW-scale thermoelectric power generation in devices from thin film assemblies of microwave-synthesized p-Sb2Te3 nanoplates and n-Ag2Te nanowires on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. While microwave cycling is crucial for Ag2Te nanocrystal shaping, Sb2Te3 formation is sensitive to precursors and surfactant concentrations. Introducing S doping in Sb2Te3 in the 1 - 1.5 atomic percent range via thioglycolic acid during synthesis yields an up to eightfold higher power-factor, due to a fivefold increase in electrical conductivity and 25% increase in Seebeck coefficient. Our microfilm devices generate up to 33.6 mV from 5 deg C to 50 deg C thermal gradients, with 120 nW maximum power output at Delta T 30 deg C, which is sixtyfold higher than Sb2Te3 paper devices. Mechanical bending can increase device resistance by up to 125% due to diminished inter-nanostructure electronic transport. These findings provide insights for integrating synthesis, morphology engineering and device design for next-generation wearable thermoelectric systems.</p>

            <h2>Free energy dissipation and a decomposition of general jump diffusions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ without detailed balance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyuan Fan, Qi Zhang</p>
            <p>We analyze the thermodynamic structure of jump diffusions combining Brownian and Poisson noise, a class of stochastic dynamics relevant to nonequilibrium statistical physics. For such nonlocal dynamics, the free energy admits a full dissipation formula that decomposes into entropy production and housekeeping heat. A central result is a decomposition of the generator into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts with respect to the invariant measure $\rho_{ss}$. The symmetric sector corresponds to a reversible dynamics and yields a nonlocal Fisher information governing free-energy decay, whereas the anti-symmetric sector generates a canonical conservative flow that produces circulation but no dissipation. Several numerical examples demonstrate how this decomposition clarifies the structure of nonequilibrium stationary states in jump-driven systems.</p>

            <p>Quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ attract considerable interest due to their high Curie temperatures (up to $710$K), which strongly depend on the A-site cation. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate their electronic structure and magnetic exchange interactions. A band mechanism of magnetism that explains the antiferromagnetic character of the exchange interactions and their strong dependence on the filling of the Re $t_{2g}$ states is proposed. These antiferromagnetic interactions stabilize ferrimagnetic ground state. The calculated Curie temperatures, obtained within the Onsager reaction field theory, are in a good agreement with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Stable Bimeron Transport Driven by Spoof Surface Acoustic Waves on Chiral Metastructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huaijin Ma, Te Liu, Jiachen Sheng, Kaiyan Cao, Jinpeng Yang, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>Topological quasiparticles, such as merons and bimerons, are characterized by non-trivial textures that exhibit remarkably robust transport against deformation, offering significant potential for information processing. While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Christianen, Anna M. Seiler, Alperen Tüğen, Ataç İmamoğlu</p>
            <p>Rydberg excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors provide sensitive and non-destructive probes of physics in proximal sample layers that host correlated electronic states. In particular, electron or hole doping of the sample layer is heralded by a strong frequency shift and loss of transition strength of 2s excitons in the sensor layer; these features have been attributed to the formation of a bound state of a 2s exciton and a remote electron. Through a theoretical analysis of exciton-electron scattering, we show that the experimental spectra can only be explained by electron-mediated hybridization of 2s, 2p and interlayer excitons, leading to a new type of many-body state which we term Rydberg attractive polaron. We anticipate that this new understanding will ensure a more accurate assessment of the signatures of correlated electrons in two dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Geometry protected probabilistic structure in many-body dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Liu, Chushun Tian, Dahai He</p>
            <p>Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics.</p>

            <p>GeSn semiconductors are group-IV isovalent alloys that offer remarkable tunability of optoelectronic properties across the entire infrared spectrum, while remaining fully compatible with silicon processing standards. These attributes make GeSn a promising platform for scalable sensing, imaging, and communication technologies. Yet, the influence of dimensionality on GeSn crystal growth remains poorly understood, limiting the development of integrated nanoscale infrared devices. Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure. The fins exhibit uniform Sn incorporation of approximately 16 at.% throughout their volume, indicating high compositional homogeneity. These findings uncover an anisotropic growth regime in metastable GeSn alloys, enriching the fundamental understanding of nanoscale epitaxy.</p>

            <h2>Surface-directed spinodal decomposition in binary fluid mixtures on an amorphous wall: A molecular dynamics study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syed Shuja Hasan Zaidi, Madhu Priya, Sanjay Puri, Prabhat K. Jaiswal</p>
            <p>We present molecular dynamics (MD) results to discuss wetting kinetics in binary fluid mixtures ($A:B=50:50$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition (SDSD) on an amorphous wall. Our simulations show the formation of a wetting layer rich in the preferred $A$-type particles and bicontinuous domain morphology in the bulk. In addition, the mixture maintains connectivity between the bulk and the wetting layer through $A$-rich tubes throughout the depletion region. The wetting layer thickness coarsens as a power law, $R_1(t)\sim t^{\alpha}$, with two distinct growth regimes of $\alpha=1/3$ and $\alpha=1$ active for at least a decade. The computed crossover time for $\alpha=1/3 \to 1$ equaled the reported bulk crossover time, and the corresponding crossover length scale $R_c$ agrees well with the expression $\Lambda = \sqrt{2k/\gamma_0}$ given by Scholten et al.~[\emph{Macromolecules}2005, 38, 3515] for bicontinuous domains in aqueous polymer mixtures in the presence of only one dominant length scale. This agreement supports a hydrodynamic picture of diffusive growth for the interconnected wetting layer and bulk domains, where the bending contribution ($k$) of curvature-dependent $AB$ interfacial tension ($\gamma$) governs small-scale coarsening, producing $t^{1/3}$ growth. For length scales beyond $\Lambda$, capillary flows yield the viscous hydrodynamic regime ($\sim t$). Our results show no orientational effects on the domain coarsening parallel and perpendicular to the wall, contrasting many continuum models, including combinations with Flory-Huggins theory.</p>

            <h2>Confinement-Driven Exciton Behavior in 2D Halide Perovskites from Dielectric-Dependent Hybrid Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael B. Araujo, Mustafa Mahmoud Aboulsaad, Sebastian E. Reyes-Lillo, Tomas Edvinsson</p>
            <p>Understanding how dielectric anisotropy governs excitonic behavior in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites is critical for predicting and engineering their optoelectronic properties. In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments. The results establish a clear correlation between dielectric anisotropy, electronic structure, and exciton binding energy at different timescales in layered perovskites, providing essential insight for the design of 2D optoelectronic materials and devices.</p>

            <h2>Optical conductivity of a dirty current-carrying superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem V. Polkin, Mikhail A. Skvortsov</p>
            <p>We develop a full microscopic theory for the optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega)$, of a dirty current-carrying superconductor. Within the Keldysh sigma model formalism, we obtain the general analytical expression for $\sigma(\omega)$, applicable for arbitrary frequency $\omega$, temperature $T$, and dc supercurrent $I$. In addition to altering the usual Mattis-Bardeen conductivity, $\sigma_1(\omega)$, a finite supercurrent introduces two new contributions: $\sigma_2^\text{qp}(\omega)$ from quasiparticle redistribution and $\sigma_2^\text{SH}(\omega)$ from the amplitude (Schmid-Higgs) mode excitation by the ac field. We investigate, both analytically and numerically, the main features of the optical conductivity in the presence of a dc supercurrent. They include a peak in $\text{Re}\,\sigma(\omega)$ above the optical gap and a sign change of $\text{Im}\,\sigma(\omega)$, with both effects becoming more pronounced at higher $I$ and lower $T$. We also elucidate the role of inelastic relaxation, which governs the low-frequency response, leading to a giant microwave absorption and a suppression of the apparent superfluid density at the critical current. The optical conductivity measurement of a superconductor biased by a finite dc supercurrent enables the direct observation of the Schmid-Higgs mode via transport measurements.</p>

            <h2>Probing Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics and Thermal Transport in Layered Perovskite LiYTiO4 Anode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Zhang, Wen Liu, Mingquan He, Jun Huang</p>
            <p>Layered perovskite lithium yttrium titanate ($\rm LiYTiO_4$) has recently emerged as a promising low-potential, ultrahigh-rate intercalation-type anode material for lithium-ion batteries; however, its lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties remain poorly understood, limiting a complete evaluation of its practical potential. Here, we combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat transport in $\rm LiYTiO_4$. We employ a neural evolution potential (NEP)-based framework that integrates the temperature-dependent effective potential method with the Wigner thermal transport (WTT) formalism, explicitly including both diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the heat-flux operator. Zero-temperature phonon calculations reveal dynamical instabilities associated with $\rm TiO_6$ octahedral rotation, which are stabilized at finite temperatures through anharmonic renormalization. Using the WTT approach with contributions from phonon propagation and coherence contributions, we predict a room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) of 3.8 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ averaged over all crystal orientations, in close agreement with the measured value of 3.2 \pm 0.08 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ for polycrystalline samples. To further examine the possible influence of ionic motion on high-temperature thermal transport, we compute $\kappa_{\rm L}$ using a Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics approach based on the same NEP, which yields consistent results with both experiment and WTT predictions, confirming the negligible role of Li-ion mobility in heat conduction. Our study not only identifies the ultralow thermal conductivity of $\rm LiYTiO_4$ as a key limitation for its practical application but also establishes a reliable computational framework for studying thermal properties in battery materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey</p>
            <p>We show that spatial extensions of many-species population dynamics models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions we focus on in this work, generically exhibit scale-free correlation functions of population sizes in the limit of an infinite number of species. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions.</p>

            <p>Remote epitaxy relaxes the constraints of conventional epitaxy, to enable low defect density, chemically abrupt heterostructures and exfoliation of single crystalline membranes. However, definitive evidence for a true remote mechanism remains elusive because most experiments can be explained by alternative mechanism that are macroscopically indistinguishable from true remote epitaxy. Using GdAuGe films grown on graphene/SiC (0001), we present two signatures that cannot be explained by the leading alternatives to the remote mechanism: (1) a few atomic layer thick disordered interlayer at the GdAuGe/graphene interface and (2) a $30\degree$ rotated epitaxial relationship between the GdAuGe film and the SiC substrate. Density functional theory calculations indicate these signatures arise from remote epitaxial \textit{frustration}, a competition amongst epitaxy to the remotely screened substrate, to graphene, and to the graphene-induced interfacial reconstruction. Tuning the amplitudes and periodicities of these competing potentials provides new opportunities to intentionally disrupt long-range order.</p>

We characterize resistivity, specific capacitance, and the evolution of junction parameters under room-temperature aging and thermal annealing. A consistent calibration of the junction specific capacitance $C_s$ versus $R_n A$ is established and independently validated by the performance of demonstrator SIS mixers designed using the extracted $C_s$.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear transport has emerged as a powerful approach to probe the quantum geometry of electronic wavefunctions, such as Berry curvature and quantum metric, in topological materials. While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Gispert, Nikita Kavokine</p>
            <p>The structure and transport of electrolytes in nanoscale channels are known to be affected by the electronic properties of the confining walls. This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angel Naranjo, Rumayel Pallock, Caleb Wagner, Piyush Grover</p>
            <p>We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures have recently garnered significant attention as an emerging solid-state platform for quantum technologies. However, the underlying spin dynamics, and the mechanisms determining the spin-dependent fluorescence in these defects are still poorly understood. In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures. These insights are crucial for further understanding of the spin dynamics of quantum emitters in hBN and their practical implementation in quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the theory of crystal polarization: The downside of employing the periodic boundary conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiu-Shi Huang, Su-Huai Wei</p>
            <p>Periodic boundary condition (PBC) is a standard approximation for calculating crystalline materials properties. However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle.</p>

            <h2>A Numerical Perspective on Moiré Superlattices: From Single-Particle Properties to Many-Body Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Lu, Bo Xie, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>Moiré superlattices in two-dimensional materials provide a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated and topological phases. This work presents a practical theoretical workflow for studying the correlated and topological states in moiré systems, combining continuum modeling, Hartree-Fock mean-field approximations, many-body perturbation theory, and exact diagonalizations. We focus on the numerical implementation of these methods, emphasizing subtleties such as remote band effects, inhomogeneous and dynamical screening, double counting problem, etc., which are often swept under the rug in theoretical works. The workflow enables a systematic investigation of symmetry-breaking ground state properties, quasiparticle excitation properties and fractional Chern insulator phases emerging from moiré superlattices, providing insights that are directly relevant to experimental observations. By bridging technical details and physical interpretations, this work aims to guide both theorists and experimentalists in understanding and predicting correlated phenomena in moiré materials.</p>

            <p>Lonsdaleite -- hexagonal diamond -- has only recently been proposed as a wide-bandgap host capable of supporting optically active point defects, but no such centres have yet been observed. Here we provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite does in fact host photoluminescent color centres. In meteoritic lonsdaleite grains from the ureilite NWA7983, we identify a new defect, RU1, which exhibits bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm, with optimal blue excitation (~455 nm) and a peak at ~700 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns with no detectable blinking, bleaching, or charge conversion. From the excitation-emission energetics we infer an unresolved zero-phonon line near 550 nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirms the lonsdaleite host lattice, and compositional analysis suggests N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents. These results suggest lonsdaleite could become a new quantum-grade crystalline platform and indicate that hexagonal-diamond color centres may form a new and unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters.</p>

            <p>The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is investigated in hematite, a collinear antiferromagnetic insulator, across a broad wavelength spectrum. By combining the optical measurements with magnetometry results, we unambiguously demonstrate that the Néel-order contribution dominates the MOKE signal, while contributions from net magnetization and external magnetic fields are negligible. This conclusion is quantitatively supported by first-principles calculations, and qualitatively by a symmetry analysis that the Néel contribution appears at the first order in spin-orbit coupling while the magnetization contribution starts only at the third order. This study clarifies the altermagnetic origin of the pronounced MOKE in hematite, underscoring the potential of altermagnets as a promising new class of magneto-optical materials.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal charge transport in an iron-based superconductor with broken inversion symmetry engineered by a hydrogen-concentration gradient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Nagai, Yukito Nishio, Jumpei Matsumoto, Kota Hanzawa, Hidenori Hiramatsu, Hideo Hosono, Tsuyoshi Kimura</p>
            <p>The breaking of spatial inversion symmetry in condensed matter gives rise to intriguing physical properties, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, spin-momentum locking, and nonreciprocal responses. Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities.</p>

            <p>Uranium dihydride UH2 is a metastable phase unknown in bulk form but accessible through thin-film synthesis. We prepared UH2 films by reactive dc sputtering on CaF2(001) or Si(001) substrates, the latter equipped with a Mo buffer layer to suppress a U-Si interdiffusion. On CaF2, UH2 adopts the fluorite-type structure with a near-[1 1 1] out-of-plane texture, four rotational domains, and a lattice parameter a = 539 +- 3 pm without measurable strain, whereas the Mo-buffered film is polycrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed complete hydrogenation and minimal oxidation. Magnetization and XMCD measurements show ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperatures of 120-130 K and a uranium 5f moment of 0.9 {\mu}B/U, dominated by the orbital contribution ({\mu}L ~ 1.4 {\mu}B, {\mu}S ~ -0.5 {\mu}B), in a good agreement with GGA+U computations, which otherwise overestimate absolute values of the spin and orbital components. The slightly reduced moment in thinner CaF2-supported films is attributed to surface U(IV) species. These results demonstrate that thin-film synthesis enables stabilization of UH2 and direct probing of 5f magnetism, opening pathways toward higher uranium hydrides and interface-engineered actinide systems.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic signatures of Chern number sign reversal in twisted bilayer WSe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Lv, Ya-Ning Ren, Lin He</p>
            <p>The discovery of quantized Chern numbers in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers,including 3.7{deg} twisted MoTe2 and 1.23{deg} twisted WSe2,has emerged as a defining breakthrough in physics. A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12.</p>

            <h2>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

            <p>The interplay between charge-density waves (CDWs), which break translational symmetry, and spatially homogeneous superconductivity, which breaks global U(1) gauge symmetry, can give rise to an intriguing phenomenon: the pair-density wave, characterized by a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter. Yet how CDWs couple to unconventional superconducting states-particularly those with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)-remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy on heavily hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, which hosts an s $\pm$ is superconducting state, we reveal a previously unobserved coupling between a surface CDW and TRSB superconductivity. Experimentally, the TRSB superconductivity imparts "chirality" to the CDW, which manifests as commensurate domains separated by domain walls with $\pi$-phase slips-forming what we term a bipolar CDW. The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $\delta$ $\phi$ = $\pi$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Pauli Master Equation numerical analysis of coherent and incoherent dressed fermions in triplet unconventional superconductors</h2>

            <p>We report two types of dressed fermions in a triplet superconductor with an in-situ disorder effective field. They are obtained numerically by analyzing with the Pauli Master Equation, the self-consistent imaginary part data of the elastic-scattering cross-section. We use a two-component irreducible representation of the order parameter with quasi-point nodes and study the quasi-classical effective probabilistic density distribution as function of disorder. We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance. We conclude that the most stable dressed fermion states are those in which the field has dilute disorder, the threshold zero gap, and some dressed fermions behave like an s-wave superconductor, showing a tiny gap.</p>

            <p>Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B -- a widely used permanent magnet -- has magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants that differ between the bulk and interface regions. This study explores the effects of lattice distortion on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B. Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B alloys were fabricated; scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries. Using the full-potential Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker method, we calculated the strain dependence of $K_{\rm u}$, showing that although $K_{\rm u}$ is 4.2 MJ/m$^3$ under strain-free conditions at 0 K, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. Additionally, Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B exhibits a larger $K_{\rm u}$ than Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B under undistorted conditions, whereas Pr-rich alloys exhibit a more pronounced reduction in $K_{\rm u}$ under strain. These findings highlight the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties. The calculated strain-dependent magnetic anisotropy parameters provide valuable inputs for future micromagnetic simulations, aiding the design of advanced magnetic materials.</p>

We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster convergence during the training process.</p>

            <p>The interplay of the excitoniclike polariton, polariton, and photoniclike polariton coherent states in mass-imbalanced electron-hole systems within optical microcavities is theoretically examined. Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions.</p>

            <p>Predicting relaxed atomic structures of chemically complex materials remains a major computational challenge, particularly for high-entropy systems where traditional first-principles methods become prohibitively expensive. We introduce the edge-aware graph attention model, a physics-informed graph neural network tailored for predicting relaxed atomic structures of high-entropy systems. the edge-aware graph attention model employs chemically and geometrically informed descriptors that capture both atomic properties and local structural environments. To effectively capture atomic interactions, our model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism that adaptively weighs neighbouring atoms using both node and edge features. This edge-aware attention framework learn complex chemical and structural relationships independent of global orientation or position. We trained and evaluated the edge-aware GAT model on a dataset of carbide systems, spanning binary to high-entropy carbide compositions, and demonstrated its accuracy, convergence efficiency, and transferability. The architecture is lightweight, with a very low computational footprint, making it highly suitable for large-scale materials screening. By providing invariance to rigid-body transformations and leveraging domain-informed attention mechanisms, our model delivers a fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to DFT, enabling accelerated discovery and screening of entropy-stabilised materials.</p>

            <p>Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids.</p>

            <p>We study the trapping of charged particles and macromolecules (such as DNA) in salt gradients in aqueous solutions. The source for the salt gradient can be as simple as a dissolving ionic crystal, as shown by McDermott et al. [Langmuir 28, 15491 (2012)]. Trapping is due to a competition between localisation due to diffusiophoresis in the salt gradient, and spreading out by diffusion. The size of the trap is typically 1 to 100 micrometres. We further predict that at steady state, the particle (macromolecule) number density is a power law of the salt concentration, with an exponent that is the ratio of the diffusiophoretic mobility to the diffusion coefficient of the trapped species. This ratio increases with size and typically becomes much greater than 1 for particles or macromolecules with hydrodynamic radii of hundreds of nanometres and above. Thus large particles or macromolecules are easily caught and trapped at steady state by salt gradients.</p>

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the NCs increased from 60% to more than 90%, as a consequence of replacing Cs-oleate with TTP-Br ligand pairs. Density functional theory calculations revealed that TTP+ ions bind to the NC surface by occupying Cs+ surface sites and orienting one of their P-CH3 bonds perpendicular to the surface, akin to quaternary ammonium passivation. Importantly, TTP-Br-capped NCs exhibited higher stability in air compared to didodecyldimethylammonium bromide-capped CsPbBr3 NCs (which is considered a benchmark system), retaining 90% of their PLQY after six weeks of air exposure.

Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.</p>

            <h2>On the Role of the Canonical Transformation in the Single-Channel Kondo Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehra Özcan</p>
            <p>This pedagogical work presents the significant role that canonical transformation plays in the interpretation of the Abelian bosonized single-channel SU(2) Kondo model, emphasizing its effect on the scaling dimension $\Delta$. The transformation shifts the longitudinal exchange coupling and modifies the scaling dimension of the spin-flip vertex $\tau_{\pm} e^{\pm i\beta \phi}$. Rather than fixing $\Delta$ to the fermionic value $\tfrac{1}{2}$, we keep $\alpha$ explicit, which allows us to identify how different choices lead to marginal or relevant regimes through $(1-\Delta(\alpha))J_\perp$. This approach offers a direct way to trace the scaling behavior from the bosonized Hamiltonian and shows how the RG flow connects to the definition of the Kondo temperature, where the resistance diverges, without switching to other methods.</p>

            <h2>First principle study of electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) full Heusler: Application to embedded automotive systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Saidi, A. Abbad, W. Benstaali, K. Bahnes</p>
            <p>In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.</p>

The molecules act as sensor spins, allowing us to sample the magneto-electric coupling with nanometer precision through scanning tunneling microscopy.

            <p>Understanding the interplay between charge order and lattice instability in quantum materials remains a central challenge, as their coexistence often obscures causal relationships. This work introduces $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a novel platform to investigate charge order mediated by two distinct mechanisms. We show that the hybridization between carbon $\pi$ and lithium $s$ orbitals generates an effective long-range hopping within Li-centered hexagons. This hopping drives a Kekulé bond order, whose structure varies with charge density and the sign of the hopping. This bond order induces a Kekulé lattice distortion via electron-phonon coupling. In the limit where lithium atoms are distant from the graphene layer, a Fermi surface nesting-driven Kekulé bond order emerges, stabilized by the electron-phonon interaction. Our results establish $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a tunable platform for elucidating the causal hierarchy between electronic and structural orders in quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsimranjit Kaur, Kuldeep Suthar</p>
            <p>We examine the low-lying collective quasiparticle modes of a quasi-one-dimensional mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates having dipolar and non-dipolar atomic species. The dipolar atomic species have permanent magnetic dipolar moments. We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution. We finally reveal that miscibility driven by thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures exhibits dipole mode hardening, confirmed by the loss of long-range phase coherence through the correlation function. The mode mixing in the dispersion relations ascertains a dipolar strength-dependent miscibility transition and the low-lying quasiparticle mode evolution.</p>

            <p>We investigate the influence of correlations and plasmonic excitation on valence band-satellite of $\alpha$-Fe, along with magnetic and spectral properties as function of temperature. Coulomb interaction parameters are obtained by systematically employing various schemes in constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). This study identifies the presence of valence band satellite in Fe at $\sim$6 eV binding energy supported by (i) substantial incoherent spectral weight in the valence band spectra obtained from Density Functional Theory plus Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT) and (ii) plasmonic excitations in the frequency range $\sim$6-8 eV suggested by $G_0W_0$ calculations. We note presence of significant contribution of temperature-dependent Pauli-spin susceptibility indicating competing degree of itinerancy. $e_g$ state shows a strong temperature driven non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerging near $T_c$. Our results reveal a high-temperature orbital-selective loss of coherence eventually leads to a orbital selective collapse of magnetization at $T_c$, suggesting a ferromagnetic phase characterized by strong correlation- and temperature- dependent spectral features.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Achyut Tiwari, Bruno Gompf, Martin Dressel</p>
            <p>Understanding how microscopic interactions control macroscopic phase transitions is central to quantum materials, where charge density waves (CDWs), Mott states, and superconductivity often compete. In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuyi Wang, Junqi Xu, Xinqi Liu, Huaiqiang Wang, Lifa Zhang, Haijun Zhang</p>
            <p>Circularly polarized or axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum have attracted considerable interest. These phonons have finite magnetic moment and can couple to internal magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons. We have also performed ab initio calculations on representative materials to validate the proposed magneto-alteraxial phonon spectra and PAM patterns. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Ivanov, Eduard Ageev, Denis Danilov, Eduard Danilovskiy, Dmitry Gets</p>
            <p>Ion migration in halide perovskites is a key factor limiting the operational stability of solar cells due to formation of halogen ion enriched domains and accumulation layers. The present work demonstrates the manifestation of ion migration in two ways via Hoke and Schottky effects. Both effects are induced by external exposure but have its peculiar way of solar cell performance degradation. We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness. A thick transport layer blocks losses of charge-carrier selectivity in a solar cell and leads to an enormous increase of T80 time, from 15 seconds up to 60 minutes.</p>

            <p>The dielectric response of nano-confined fluids is crucial across technologies and biological systems, yet its calculation and interpretation from molecular simulations are often muddled by unclear boundary conditions. We re-derive the Green--Kubo relation for the spatially resolved linear dielectric response of fluids in planar confinement, explicitly accounting for boundary conditions and showing that equilibrium-derived profiles agree with those obtained from external fields. We identify common misconceptions in the literature and outline how microscopic dielectric behavior can be coarse-grained to connect with experimental observables. Simulations show that water retains a bulk-like dielectric response down to $\sim 1\,\mathrm{nm}$ confinement. The reduced \emph{effective} dielectric response that governs capacitance arises from the placement of the dielectric interface. Using effective-medium theory, we demonstrate that long-range reductions reported in experiments and theory are consistent with bulk-like behavior beyond about $1\,\mathrm{nm}$ from the surface. The effective response naturally maps onto an interfacial capacitance, and the dielectric properties of simulated water are robust across simulation setups and water models, reflecting universal polarization correlations.</p>

            <p>All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Screening Effects on Auger Recombination in Metal-Halide Perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Utkarsh Singh, Sergei I. Simak</p>
            <p>The performance of modern light-emitting technologies, from lasers to LEDs, is limited by nonradiative losses, with Auger recombination being the dominant channel at device-relevant carrier densities. Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, computed from low-scaling \textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\approx1.73$ eV) and $\gamma$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate.</p>

            <h2>Critical Density-Wave Vestigial Phases of Commensurate Pair Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chu-Tian Gao, Jing Zhou, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The pair-density-wave (PDW) is an exotic pairing state hosting a spatially modulated pairing order parameter, which has attracted great interest. Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D. Our work appeals for experimental verifications.</p>

            <p>III-V colloidal quantum dots are widely studied for their applications as detectors and emitters from visible to short-wave infrared. They might also be used in the mid-infrared if they can be stably n-doped to access their intraband transitions. Mid-infrared intraband transitions are therefore studied for InAs, InAs/InP, and InAs/ZnSe colloidal quantum dots with an energy gap at 1.4 micron. Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications.</p>

We also studied the duality relation between different conformal boundary conditions under the Kramers-Wannier transformation. These findings should facilitate a comprehensive understanding for complex CFTs and stimulate further exploration on the boundary critical phenomena within non-Hermitian strongly-correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductor $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ has generated considerable interest due to its unconventional superconductivity and complex electronic structure. Notably, $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ features a mixed Ni valence state and an asymmetric trilayer configuration, leading to distinct quasiparticle distributions and local density of states (LDOS) between the inner and outer NiO$_2$ planes. In this work, we investigate impurity-induced states in $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ using a two-orbital model combined with $T$-matrix formalism, focusing on the contrasting roles of intra- and interlayer pairing channels. Our self-consistent mean-field analysis reveals that interlayer pairing results in partially gapless Fermi surfaces, with unpaired quasiparticles concentrated in the outer layers and a pronounced low-energy LDOS. We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position. These findings suggest that single-impurity spectroscopy can serve as a powerful probe to distinguish between competing superconducting pairing mechanisms in trilayer nickelates and highlight the rich physics arising from their multilayer structure.</p>

            <p>Sodium-ion batteries have gained much interest over the past years and especially layered oxides are highly considered as cathodes for the next generation of batteries. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome in these materials for practical applications mainly related to capacity degradation and voltage fading. A key influence factor for these challenges are phase transitions that occur by gliding of layers during operation of these materials. Until now there is limited atomistic-level understanding on such transitions as simulations of these processes are computationally demanding. In this work, we trained a classical pairwise Coulomb-Buckingham potential versus extensive \textit{ab initio} data using a genetic algorithm to study O2-P2 phase transitions in Na\textsubscript{\textit{x}}CoO\textsubscript{2}. Our density functional theory~(DFT) and classical potential calculations show that phase transition barriers decrease upon desodiation and are further lowered if dynamic conditions are considered through molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed classical potential is able to capture phase transitions and its related increase in the Na-ion diffusivity under standard lab conditions at the $\upmu$s timescale of molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, it is found that the phase transition occurs gradually \textit{via} various OP\textit{n} phases.</p>

In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beau Leighton-Trudel</p>
            <p>Characterizing anisotropic correlations in quantum and statistical systems requires a coordinate-invariant framework. We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+\epsilon)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \propto \delta_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}\gamma_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $\gamma_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $\gamma_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims.</p>

            <p>A computational framework is presented for the sampling of the energy surface of magnetic systems via the systematic identification of first-order saddle points that determine connectivity of metastable states and define the mechanisms of transitions between them. The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state.</p>

We demonstrate that the dynamics of such mixtures can be effectively reduced to a single nonlinear equation. This framework is illustrated through the discussion of stable solitonic solutions in one and two dimensions. Furthermore, we show that employing a binary mixture enables exploration beyond the dynamics governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, allowing us to address other fundamental equations in nonlinear physics, such as the Landau-Lifshitz equation describing the motion of spin chains in ferromagnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Extreme Strain Controlled Correlated Metal-Insulator Transition in the Altermagnet CrSb</h2>

            <p>Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts.</p>

            <h2>Index-theoretic route to the subgap Andreev bands and topological response in Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sinchan Ghosh, Srinjoy Ghosh, Arijit Kundu, K. Sengupta</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the subgap Andreev bound states in a transparent Josephson junction, comprising of either chiral or non-chiral superconductors, can be viewed as a consequence of the index theorem in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We provide an exact solution for these states starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations describing quasiparticles in such junctions. We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4\pi$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing. We also discuss the implications of our results for Josephson junctions away from the transparent limit.</p>

            <h2>Magnonics of time-varying media: Giant amplification via phase-transition-driven temporal interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Sobucki, Pawel Gruszecki</p>
            <p>Gilbert damping-the primary obstacle limiting spin-wave propagation in magnonic devices-can be transformed from an adversary into an asset. Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation. This work establishes temporal magnonics as a new paradigm for reconfigurable, lithography-free spin-wave control.</p>

            <p>Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform.</p>

            <p>We derive exact strong zero mode (ESZM) operators for integrable spin-S chains with open boundary conditions and a boundary field. Their locality properties are generally weaker than in the previously known cases, but they still imply infinite coherence times in the vicinity of the edges. We explain how such integrable chains possess multiple ground states describing a first-order quantum phase transition, and that the odd number of such states for integer S makes the weaker locality properties necessary. We make contact with more traditional approaches by showing how the ESZM for S=1/2 acts on energy eigenstates given by solutions of the Bethe equations.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous coarsening and nonlinear diffusion of kinks in an one-dimensional quasi-classical Holstein model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ho Jang, Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>We study the phase-ordering dynamics of a quasi-classical Holstein model. At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal bounds on entropy production from fluctuating coarse-grained trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Udo Seifert</p>
            <p>Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories.</p>

            <p>The discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLSE) exhibits a transition from ergodic, delocalized dynamics to a weakly nonergodic regime characterized by breather formation; yet, a precise characterization of this transition has remained elusive. By sampling many microcanonically equivalent initial conditions, we identify the asymptotic ensemble variance of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy as a dynamical order parameter that vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes finite once ergodicity is broken. The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.</p>

            <h2>Performance Benchmarking of Tensor Trains for accelerated Quantum-Inspired Homogenization on TPU, GPU and CPU architectures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Nicolas R. Gauger</p>
            <p>Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.</p>

            <p>For the van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, although a ferromagnetic ground state has been reported, there are also reports of complex magnetic behavior suggesting coexistence of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism due to the intricate interaction between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ ions in this system. The exact nature of the interactions and the origin of antiferromagnetism are still under debate. Here, we report the observation of signature of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings between different Fe-ions in the anomalous Hall effect measured for devices of mechanically exfoliated Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ nano-flakes of thicknesses ranging from\,$\sim$\,15-20 layers. The temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect data reveal two sharp step-like switchings at low temperature ($T\lesssim150\,$K). Our detailed analyses suggest the step-like sharp switchings in anomalous Hall resistance are due to the magnetization reversal behavior of different Fe-ions in individual layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The experimental results can be explained by considering an intra-layer antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+3}$ ions, whereas intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ in the system. Our experimental results and the analyses are supported by the first-principles calculations for energetics and intralayer as well as interlayer exchange coupling constants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Koenigstein, Martin J. Steil, Stefan Floerchinger</p>
            <p>In this work, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</p>

            <h2>Detuning-insensitive wide-field imaging of vector microwave fields with diamond sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiu-Qi Chen, Rui-Zhi Zhang, Gang-Qin Liu, Huijie Zheng</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\rm{\Omega}$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded.</p>

Our system combines automated data acquisition, image processing, spectral analysis, and Bayesian optimization to explore processing parameters efficiently. This approach not only increases throughput but also enables a pointed search for optimal processing parameters.

            <p>The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</p>

Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz. We show that the narrowband THz radiation is driven by phonons associated with the ferroelectric polarization. We further demonstrate dynamic and nonvolatile control of the polarity of the coherent THz wave with external electric field.

            <p>Nuclear fusion requires overcoming or traversing a repulsive Coulomb barrier of hundreds of kiloelectronvolts, rendering the probability of fusion at sub-keV energies vanishingly small. Yet in condensed matter, the electronic and structural environment of reacting nuclei can profoundly alter fusion rates. Here we demonstrate that deuterium-deuterium fusion within metallic foils exhibits a pronounced enhancement and reaction yield plateau below energies of 2.5 keV- contrary to the expected exponential suppression with decreasing energy. Using a dual-chamber platform that combines electrochemical deuterium loading with ion-beam bombardment, we show that fusion yields in palladium and titanium hydrides are enhanced by over 10^18 compared to theoretical bare-nucleus fusion rates. These results demonstrate that access to low-energy fusion processes can be governed by materials degrees of freedom. This materials-driven fusion regime establishes a reproducible, tunable framework for studying and ultimately engineering nuclear reactions in solids. While the reaction rates reported here are low, these insights into materials-modulated fusion processes offer a potential foundation for understanding how condensed-matter environments could influence future fusion-energy concepts.</p>

            <p>In this work we study the relativistic kinetic theory of a boost-invariant conformal gas on a static, maximally symmetric background $dS_3\times \mathbb{R}$, considering all constant-curvature slicings of $dS_3$ - flat, spherical, or hyperbolic- and their associated symmetry groups. Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space.</p>

            <p>Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes.</p>

            <p>Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers in diamond (SiV$^-$) are promising for quantum photonic technologies. However, when subject to resonant optical excitation, they can inadvertently transfer into a zero-spin optically dark state. We show that this unwanted change of charge state can be quickly reversed by the resonant laser itself in combination with static electric fields. By defining interdigitated metallic contacts on the diamond surface, we increase the steady-state SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under resonant excitation by a factor $\ge3$ for most emitters, making it practically constant for certain individual emitters. We electrically activate single \sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role. Our proposed electric-field-based stabilization scheme enhances deterministic charge state control in group-IV color centers and improves its understanding, offering a scalable path toward quantum applications such as entanglement generation and quantum key distribution.</p>

            <h2>Giant optical anisotropy and visible-frequency epsilon-near-zero in hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2</h2>

            <p>The realization of extreme optical anisotropy is foundational to nanoscale light manipulation. Van der Waals (vdW) crystal MoOCl2 has emerged as a promising candidate for this quest, hosting hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. However, the fundamental anisotropic dielectric tensor governing this behavior has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this problem by providing the first experimental determination of the full dielectric tensor of hyperbolic vdW MoOCl2. Via spectroscopic ellipsometry, Mueller matrix, and reflectance measurements, we quantify the material's optical duality: a metallic optical response ({\epsilon}_1 < 0) along the crystallographic a-axis and a dielectric response ({\epsilon}_1 > 0) along the orthogonal directions. This dichotomy drives an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition at \approx 512 nm and results in giant in-plane birefringence of \delta n \approx 2.2 for MoOCl2. As a result, our work provides the critical missing experimental parameters for MoOCl2, establishing it as a benchmark hyperbolic and ENZ material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Pengmei, Spencer C. Guo, Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Aaron R. Dinner</p>
            <p>Molecular dynamics simulations can generate atomically detailed trajectories of complex systems, but analyzing these dynamics can be challenging when systems lack well-established quantitative descriptors (features). Graph neural networks (GNNs) in which messages are passed between nodes that represent atoms that are spatial neighbors promise to obviate manual feature engineering, but the use of GNNs with biomolecular systems of more than a few hundred residues has been limited in the context of analyzing dynamics by both difficulties in capturing the details of long-range interactions with message passing and the memory and runtime requirements associated with large graphs. Here, we show how local information can be aggregated to reduce memory and runtime requirements without sacrificing atomic detail. We demonstrate that this approach opens the door to analyzing simulations of protein-nucleic acid complexes with thousands of residues on single GPUs within minutes. For systems with hundreds of residues, for which there are sufficient data to make quantitative comparisons, we show that the approach improves performance and interpretability.</p>

            <h2>Concentration Matters: Enhancing Particle Settling in Narrow Tilted Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dipankar Kundu, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga, Adolfo Vázquez-Quesada, Marco Ellero</p>
            <p>Particles are known to sediment faster in containers with tilted walls than in vertical ones, a phenomenon known as the Boycott effect. In this work, we investigate how the tilt angle influences sedimentation in narrow channels across different particle volume fractions. Using particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reveal that there exists a concentration-dependent optimal tilt angle that maximizes sedimentation rates. Furthermore, at large tilt angles, the flow profiles across the channel deviate from the classical parabolic shape. We show that these non-parabolic profiles can be accurately captured by a one-dimensional Brinkman model, providing a predictive framework for understanding and tuning sedimentation in tilted geometries. Our findings demonstrate the potential to control and optimize particle settling by adjusting the channel tilt according to particle concentration, opening new possibilities for design in industrial and laboratory processes.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that if a quantum Markovian semigroup satisfies the standard quantum detailed balance condition, its generator admits a special representation that yields a vanishing entropy production rate. Conversely, if the generator admits a special representation adhering to the condition of thermodynamic consistency and leading to a vanishing entropy production rate, then the corresponding quantum Markovian semigroup must satisfy the standard quantum detailed balance condition. In this context, we adopt the definition of entropy production rate that is motivated by the physics literature and standard for thermodynamically consistent Lindbladians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zecheng Shen, Shuhan Ding, Zijun Zhao, Francesco A. Evangelista, Yao Wang</p>
            <p>Entanglement plays a central role in quantum technologies, yet its characterization and control in materials remain challenging. Recent developments in spectrum-based entanglement witnesses have enabled new strategies for quantifying many-body entanglement in macroscopic materials. Here, we develop a protocol for detecting spin--orbital entanglement using experiment-accessible resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Central to our approach is the construction of a Hermitian generator from experimentally measurable spectra, which allows us to compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI) available in spin--orbital systems. The resulting QFI provides upper bounds for $k$-producible states and thus serves as a robust witness of spin--orbital entanglement. To account for realistic experimental limitations, we further extend our framework to include relaxed QFI bounds applicable to measurements lacking full polarization resolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang-Wei Li, Kai-Wei Huang, Chien-Ting Chen, Fu-Jiun Jiang</p>
            <p>The critical phenomena of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4,5$ and 6 are investigated using the technique of supervised neural network (NN). Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijiang Ji, Yunbo Zhang, Shu Chen, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence and control of multiple topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide lattice with generalized Bernoulli-type disorder introduced in the intradimer couplings. By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.</p>

            <p>As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting experimentally-realizable 3D molecular crystal structures from their 2D chemical graphs is a long-standing open challenge in computational chemistry called crystal structure prediction (CSP). Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, OXtal recovers experimental structures with conformer $\text{RMSD}_1<0.5$ Å and attains over 80\% packing similarity rate, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>The ringdown phase of a perturbed black hole is conventionally described by a linear superposition of quasinormal modes. However, as the AdS black brane approaches its final global equilibrium, this linear quasinormal mode description becomes inadequate, and nonlinear dynamics play a significant role in the late-stage evolution. We show that the interplay between nonlinear evolution and horizon dissipation in general relativity drives dynamical AdS black branes towards the final state along a unique path, independent of their initial perturbations. Through numerical simulations, we identify this late-time attractor and uncover the associated universal nonlinear behavior, characterized by a simple dimensionless relative amplitude in the dual hydrodynamic variables.</p>

Further, we show that the non-Hermitian quantum metric appears in the response of the system upon time-periodic modulation, which one can use to experimentally measure the non-Hermitian quantum metric. We validate our results by providing numerical simulations of concrete exemplary systems.</p>

            <p>Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements.</p>

            <p>Memory effects arise in many complex systems, from protein folding, to the spreading of epidemics and financial decisions. While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a systematic study of the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an efficient and versatile tool for the analysis of critical and low-temperature phase states in spin system models. The problem of calculating the dependence of the average energy on the spatial distribution of exchange integrals for the Edwards-Anderson model on a square lattice with frustrated interactions is considered. We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems.</p>

We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</p>

The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) is a highly intriguing candidate for heterostructure optoelectronic applications, such as Deep Ultraviolet photodetectors, UV sensing and communication systems and solar cells. This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication.</p>

In the (n,Q)- basis of chord states, the grand canonical transfer matrix is block diagonal, where each block is the canonical transfer matrix for the respective charge sector. We therefore conclude that the Krylov complexity for the grand canonical ensemble is given by the sum of the complexities in the charge sectors weighted by a probability function that depends on the chemical potential. Finally, we compute the Krylov complexity analytically in the limit of early and late time in the charge sector and numerically for both canonical and grand canonical ensemble.</p>

            <p>We propose an experimental apparatus to reveal the quantum coherence manifested in downward quantum jumps of amplitude bistability. The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade.</p>

            <p>We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.</p>

By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the \textit{pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with \textit{pulse} photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Gibbs Ensemble from Eigenstate Entanglement Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Biao Lian</p>
            <p>Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By drawing an analogy between eigenstate reduced density matrix and GGE, we conjecture that a natural set of conserved quantities for GGE can emerge from the reduced density matrices of properly chosen eigenstates by the entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM) framework, and we demonstrate this explicitly for models mappable to free fermions. The framework proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superpositions of eigenstate entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates are Fock states occupying what we call the common eigenmodes, which remain eigenmodes when truncated within the physical subsystem. For 1D homogeneous free fermions with (anti-)periodic boundary conditions, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons with nearest neighbor hoppings, these conserved quantities lead to a non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of this framework may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.</p>

            <p>Experiments have pointed to the formation of the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at $x \sim 0.8$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) superconducting state at $T_{\rm c}^{U(1)}$ and normal-metal state at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. We report a theory of the acoustic effects spectroscopy of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements. We show that the experimental results are consistent with BTRS superconductivity at $x \sim 0.8$, fulfilling the necessary condition for the formation of electron quadrupling in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We provide the theoretical basis and the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.</p>

Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Green's functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta \omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta \omega = 2\pi/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome by augmenting the time series with complex-time Krylov states. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

            <p>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the exotic topologically stable skyrmion spin textures in the noncentrosymmetric crystals. The recent discovery of biskyrmions and skyrmions in the globally centrosymmetric crystals has raised debate about the role of the DMI in causing the spin textures, since DMI vanishes in such crystal structures. Theoretical studies, on the other hand, suggest non-vanishing DMI even if there is local inversion symmetry breaking in an otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystal structure. Motivated by such theoretical predictions, we present here the results of a systematic crystal structure study of two skyrmion-hosting Ni2In-type centrosymmetric hexagonal compounds, MnNiGa and MnPtGa, using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique. Our result provides information about structural correlations in the short-range (SR), medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) regimes simultaneously. The analysis of the experimental PDFs, obtained from high flux, high energy, and high Q synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction patterns, reveals that the local SR structure of both MnNiGa and MnPtGa compounds corresponds to the noncentrosymmetric trigonal space group P3m1, while the structure in the MR+LR regimes remains hexagonal in the centrosymmetric P63/mmc space group. These findings are also supported by theoretical DFT calculations. Our results, in conjunction with the previous theoretical predictions, provide a rationale for the genesis of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials in terms of non-vanishing DMI due to local inversion symmetry breaking. We believe that our findings would encourage a systematic search of skyrmionic textures and other topological phenomena in a vast family of centrosymmetric materials.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity and large internal surface area, provide versatile platforms for integrating spin centers with potential applications in catalysis and quantum sensing. Here, we identify a stable NH radical spin center in UiO-66-NH2, a zirconium-based MOF with aminoterephthalic acid (TPA-NH2) linkers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH2 linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH2 family.</p>

            <p>Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.</p>

            <h2>The exact mobility edges in SVQL (slowly-varying quasiperiodic ladder) model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpita Goswami</p>
            <p>We propose a minimal two-leg ladder model in which the mobility edge (ME) arises solely due to bond modulation, introduced through a slowly varying quasiperiodic modulation in the inter-leg tunnelling amplitudes. We demonstrate that this bond-modulated ladder naturally hosts two propagation channels, whose symmetric and antisymmetric combinations experience opposite effective onsite potentials, unlike the one-dimensional quasiperiodic models with onsite modulations. Using the adiabatic (slowly varying) limit of the modulation, we derive an exact analytical condition for the single-particle mobility edge, $E_c=\pm|2t-\lambda|,$ where $t$ is the hopping amplitude along both the legs and $\lambda$ is the bond modulation strength. This result directly generalizes the classic ME condition for slowly varying onsite potentials to a multi-leg (two-leg in our case) geometry. Extensive numerical calculations, including inverse participation ratios, Lyapunov exponents, density of states, and participation-ratio scaling, demonstrate excellent agreement with the analytical prediction across a wide range of parameters. We further identify a regime for small modulation exponents $0 < \nu <1$, where localized and weakly delocalized states coexist even beyond the transition point ($\lambda_c=2t$). Our results establish that a deterministic bond modulation can serve as a sufficient ingredient to produce an exact ME in ladder systems, offering experimentally accessible routes toward tuning nonergodic extended phases.</p>

The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We study the electromagnetic (EM) response of the excitonic insulator phase of a time-reversal (TR) invariant Weyl semimetal (WSM). At low temperatures, the system develops two exciton condensates. The condensates are related to each other by TR symmetry and weakly coupled by a Josephson tunneling term. The latter leads to the formation of the Leggett mode [Number-phase fluctuations in two-band superconductors, Prog. Theor. Phys. 36, 901 (1966).] with a small gap. Our main finding is that the Leggett mode couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. This is a consequence of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM. Because of the small axion mass, its coupling to EM fields results in a giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence in the presence of a static magnetic field. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap.</p>

            <h2>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Go Uchida, Hiromi Miyoshi, Hitoshi Washizu</p>
            <p>Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the Lévy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</p>

            <p>Topologically nontrivial band structure of a material may give rise to special states that are confined to the material's boundary and protected against disorder and scattering. Quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is a paradigmatic example of phenomenon in which such states appear in the presence of time-reversal symmetry in two dimensions. Whereas the spatial structure of these helical edge states has been largely studied, their dynamic properties are much less understood. We design a microwave experiment mimicking QSHE and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of unidirectional transport of optical angular momentum (or pseudospin) by edge states. Pseudospin-polarized signal propagation is shown to be immune to scattering by defects introduced along the edge. Its velocity is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light in the free space, which may have important consequences for practical applications of topological edge states in modern optical and quantum-information technologies.</p>

Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreemayee Aditya</p>
            <p>This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q>1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition.</p>

            <p>A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic-field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural, between two distinct altermagnet states, and is accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8,0<y<1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be cleanly tuned by pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching in films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in quasi-static Deep Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexei V. Tkachenko</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought increasing attention to their energy use during training and inference. Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E< 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Van Tuan Vo, Andreas Dechant, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by overdamped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap of the symmetrized time-evolution operator closes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.</p>

We numerically find that the neutral gap of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) ground state decreases as the Berry curvature becomes less homogeneous, ultimately driving an instability to a charge density wave. We further extend our analysis to bands perturbed away from the ideal limit and give examples where a less ideal band geometry results in a more stable FCI phase. To explain our findings, we apply the single mode approximation to the ground state wave functions of the ideal band, from which we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetoroton minimum. Finally, we make a connection between our results and experimentally relevant systems where FCIs have been observed.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are an emerging class of unconventional antiferromagnets, characterized by a Néel ordering that does not break the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice. Depending on the orientation of the Néel vector, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) may or may not exist. In the so-called pure altermagnets, AHE is forbidden by the magnetic symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in pure altermagnets, the domain walls can lift the symmetry constraints, thereby activating the AHE and orbital magnetization. Taking a representative example of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we use the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall AHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while the spin magnetization does not play a significant role. Using Landau theory, we argue that while for a random arrangement of $\pi$ domain walls, the contributions from the individual domain walls will cancel one another, an external magnetic field will favor domain-wall arrangements with specific chirality giving rise to a net AHE signal. Using group theory, we discuss how these findings can be generalized straightforwardly to certain other classes of altermagnets. Our work reveals a crucial role of the domain walls in the understanding of the Hall transport and orbital magnetism of altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Solid-state platforms based on bosonic quasiparticles offer a compelling route toward on-chip quantum information technologies scalable to nanometer dimensions. Coherence time, a key figure of merit for any quantum system, is fundamentally limited by the lifetime of quasiparticles that store quantum information. For magnons - bosonic excitations of collective magnetization dynamics - it has long been reported that their lifetime does not exceed a few hundred nanoseconds, placing a stringent constraint on their use in quantum architectures. Here, we demonstrate magnon lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s. Experiments performed on single-crystal yttrium iron garnet spheres cooled to 30 mK reveal relaxation times of short-wavelength magnons nearly two orders of magnitude longer than previously observed. These findings overturn the established view of magnon dissipation limits, positioning magnons as viable, long-lived information carriers for solid-state quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Classification for Alternating Excitons in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Yuntian Liu, Igor Zutic</p>
            <p>Excitons, bound electron-holes states, often dominate the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials and reflect their inherent properties, including spin-orbit coupling, magnetic ordering, or band topology. By focusing on a growing class of collinear antiferromagnets with a nonrelativistic spin splitting, referred to also as altermagnets (AM), we propose a theoretical framework based on the spin space group (SSG) to elucidate their resulting excitons. Our approach is illustrated on 2D AM with spin-polarized valleys, where we classify the combination of conduction and valence bands by the SSG representations into two cases that hosts bright $s$-like and $p$-like excitons, respectively. This analysis is further supported by effective Hamiltonians and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We identify the excitonic optical selection rules from the calculated absorption spectra and the symmetry of bright excitons from their momentum space envelope functions. Our framework provides optical fingerprints for various cases of AM, while their tunability, such as the strain-induced valley splitting, is also transferred to excitons allowing, additionally, valley-polarized photocurrent generation.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling native defects is essential for unlocking the full potential of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Here, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations are used to explore the electronic properties of bulk CrSBr. ARPES measurements reveal clear signatures of conduction band filling in as-grown crystals, indicative of unintentional doping. An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies. Our results shed light on the origin of unintentional $\textit{n}$-type doping of CrSBr and pave the way for new strategies for defect control and electronic property tuning in this van der Waals magnet.</p>

This setup enables the excitation of a single line of ordered Faraday waves along each end wall when viscous forces dominate interfacial dynamics. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for the breakup of the wave tips in a regular array of droplets scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the kinematic viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily tuned by varying the forcing parameters, and the number of droplets generated per cycle is proportional to the width of the container.</p>

            <h2>Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Bai, Anna R. Dardia, Toshihiko Shimasaki, David M. Weld</p>
            <p>Light-induced quantum phases offer the potential for simple and powerful tuning of material properties. For example, simply illuminating 2D materials in the integer quantum Hall regime with polarized light is predicted to drive quantum phase transitions. Such phenomena are largely beyond the current frontier of solid state experiments due to technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report results of such an experiment. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in anomalous polarization-dependent subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <h2>Topology and Localizations in a 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model with Domain Walls, Quasi-periodic Disorder and Periodic Hopping Modulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Mandal, Satyaki Kar</p>
            <p>A two dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with topological defects like domain walls (DW) / vortices or quasi-periodic disorders is a perfect blend for investigating topology and localization of quantum states. In a 2D SSH model, zero energy states (ZES) lie within the dispersion continuum for both periodic and open boundaries. We consider two different distribution of DWs of which the first one shows the bound states in continuum (BIC) to populate at the corners (producing higher order topological modes) or the DW center while the second one, with a vortex like radially symmetric distribution of hopping modulations, shows localizations along the DWs and the edges. The topological yet gapped in-gap states, with nonzero Zak phases, show an opposite trend with localizations at the edges and along the DWs in the first case as opposed to localizations at the DW center in the second case. Investigation on the effect of on-site quasiperiodic disorders manifests the usual tendency of the states to localize. However, reentrant localization behavior is also captured for judicious choice of the disordered term, making this the first reported example of its kind in a 2D system. Furthermore, while varying the hopping periodicity, we discover that anisotropic hopping modulations along x and y directions within the lattice produces significant changes in topological features where bulk ZES get exhausted leaving only topological boundary modes at zero energies. We also discuss the fate of these states in presence of the DWs. All these analysis depicting topological/localization features of varied kinds can become very useful in the field of quantum computation and information processing.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siheon Ryee, Niklas Witt, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim O. Wehling</p>
            <p>High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $\gamma$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p>

We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.</p>

            <p>We present a canonical formalism for computing quantum fluctuations of certain discrete degrees of freedom in systems governed by integrable partial differential equations with known Hamiltonian structure, provided these models are classical-field approximations of underlying many-body quantum systems. We then apply the formalism to both the 2-soliton and 3-soliton breather solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, assuming the breathers are created from an initial elementary soliton by quenching the coupling constant. In particular, we compute the immediate post-quench quantum fluctuations in the positions, velocities, norms, and phases of the constituent solitons. For each case, we consider both the white-noise and correlated-noise models for the fluctuation vacuum state. Unlike previous treatments of the problem, our method allows for analytic solutions. Additionally, in the correlated-noise case, we consider the particle-number-conserving (also called $U(1)$-symmetry-conserving) Bogoliubov modes, i.e., modes with the proper correction to preserve the total particle number. We find that in most (but not all) cases, these corrections do not change the final result.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Yadav, Prabhat Kumar Jaiswal, Rudolf Podgornik, Sunita Kumari</p>
            <p>The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo / molecular dynamics simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct molecular simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at low salt concentration, whereas at high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, diminishing the CR effect. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing nanoparticle interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in low salt concentrations.</p>

            <h2>Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun</p>
            <p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p>

The study focuses on quantifying the effects of confinement on the local-density models of the exchange and kinetic energies used in orbital-free density-based quantum computation methods. Significant discrepancies are observed between the energies obtained from the Hartree--Fock approximation and those predicted by the local density approximation (LDA) and the Thomas--Fermi model (TF) evaluated at the computed electron densities, both in the inner region and on the surface of the system. To reconcile these differences, refined expressions for the local one-electron energy densities, parametrized by the system's size and background charge density, are proposed. These models are also compared with commonly used gradient-based energy functionals.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <p>Exploring novel topological matters with exotic quantum states has always been a core issue in the field of condensed matter physics, which can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single band gap. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from the well-known first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Particularly, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and discover a three-dimensional unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both helical and corner topological states and exhibits an unprecedented bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</p>

            <p>We explore the capabilities of physical computing with Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. To solve Sudokus with ONNs, we define a novel mapping strategy that utilizes the unique characteristics of the computation paradigm. The problem is encoded through a puzzle specific graph-embedding, which implements the constraints through different subgraphs. These subgraphs are then combined into a single adjacency matrix, which allows the natural dynamics of the phases of coupled oscillators to find a solution to the puzzle. We model the phase dynamics of the ONN by means of the Kuramoto differential equation. This novel approach is then compared to the well-established iterative method to solve Sudoku already used in binary Hopfield networks (HNN). Solving optimization problems typically requires a large amount of energy to solve on conventional hardware. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the mapping of Sudoku from a theoretical point of view to establish the validity of this approach. The simulation results show that the novel ONN mapping outperforms the established HNN methodology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shusei Wadashima, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>Spin-liquid and spin-glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p>

            <p>Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksim Stebliy, Alex Jenkins, Luana Benetti, Ricardo Ferreira</p>
            <p>Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.</p>

            <p>Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enables high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</p>

            <p>Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering from semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on Ge(111)$c(2\times8)$, for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent-electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model, and validate these results through numerically exact quantum-dynamical simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach. While mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface.</p>

            <h2>An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Jonathan Weare, Aaron R. Dinner</p>
            <p>For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. The key idea is that, when trajectories enter the stable states, the times that they enter (stopping times) must be used for estimating the committor and transition rate instead of the lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We show how further accuracy for the transition rate can be achieved by combining results from two lag times. We also relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.</p>

            <h2>Hidden Moiré Topology of Low-Symmetry Weyl Surfaces</h2>

            <p>Topological materials are defined by the correspondence between bulk topology and boundary states, yet this correspondence becomes enigmatic on low-symmetry surfaces where bulk and surface periodicities are inherently mismatched. Here we reveal a hidden moiré topology emerging on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncovers closed Fermi-arc loops and momentum-space moiré modulations, phenomena unanticipated in conventional topological theory. We show that these emerge from incomplete bulk projection and multi-cell interference governed by a least-common-multiple framework. Least-common-multiple guided DFT and Green's-function calculations quantitatively reproduce the observed spectra, establishing the universality of this commensuration rule. These findings transform a long-standing paradox of bulk-boundary correspondence into a new paradigm of momentum-space moiré reconstruction, bridging crystalline and quasicrystalline topologies and opening routes to flat-band engineering on complex surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Capillarity in Stationary Random Granular Media: Distribution-Aware Screening and Quantitative Supercell Sizing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Tantardini, Fernando Alonso-Marroquin</p>
            <p>We develop a quantitative framework to determine the minimal periodic supercell required for representative simulations of capillarity-screened Darcy flow in stationary random, polydisperse granular media. The microstructure is characterized by two-point statistics (covariance and spectral density) that govern finite-size fluctuations. Capillarity is modeled as a screened, modified-Helmholtz problem with phase-dependent transport under periodic boundary conditions; periodic homogenization yields an apparent conductivity, an apparent screening parameter, and a macroscopic capillary decay length. Because screening imparts a spatial low-pass response, we introduce a distribution-aware treatment of polydispersity consisting of a capillarity-weighted volume fraction and a screened analogue of the integral range that preserves variance units and recovers classical descriptors in the appropriate limits. These descriptors lead to two sizing rules: (i) a length criterion on the shortest cell edge controlled by a microstructural correlation length, the macroscopic decay length, and a high quantile of grain size; and (ii) a volume criterion that links the target coefficient of variation to the screened integral range and the phase contrast. The framework couples statistical microstructure information to capillary response and yields reproducible, distribution-aware supercell selection for image-based finite-element or fast-Fourier-transform solvers.</p>

            <h2>Structural and Compositional Complexities of Hierarchical Self-Assembly: a Hypergraph Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexei V. Tkachenko</p>
            <p>Programmable self-assembly enables the construction of complex molecular, supramolecular, and crystalline architectures from well-designed building blocks. We introduce a hypergraph-based formalism, Blocks & Bonds (B&B), that generalizes classical chemical graph theory by incorporating directed and multicolored interactions, internal symmetries, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop the Structure Code (SC), a compact and versatile language for describing self-assembled architectures. We define a Kolmogorov-style Structural Complexity as the total information content of SC, obtained through its tokenization and Shannon information assignment. Complementing this encoding-based measure, we introduce a much simpler quantity, the Compositional Complexity, which depends only on the number and cumulative usage of block and bond types in the construction set. A central result of this work is a strong empirical correlation between the token-based Structural Complexity and the Compositional Complexity across all examined systems. Owing to this agreement, the Compositional Complexity emerges as the most practical and broadly applicable measure: it is easy to compute, requires no explicit encoding, and yet closely tracks the actual information content of structurally diverse architectures. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose), DNA-origami lattices, and crystalline assemblies show that B\&B hypergraphs provide a unified, scalable, and information-efficient representation of structural organization, naturally capturing symmetry, modularity, and stereochemistry. This framework establishes a quantitative foundation for complexity-aware classification and inverse design of programmable matter.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic linear magnetoresistance in nanoflakes of Dirac semimetal NiTe2</h2>

            <p>This work investigates the magneto-transport properties of exfoliated NiTe2 nano-flakes with varying thicknesses and disorder levels, unveiling two distinct physical mechanisms governing the observed anisotropic linear magnetoresistance (MR). For the perpendicular magnetic field configuration, the well-defined linear MR in high fields is unambiguously attributed to a classical origin. This conclusion is supported by the proportionality between the MR slope and the carrier mobility, and between the crossover field and the inverse of mobility. In stark contrast, the linear MR under parallel magnetic fields exhibits a non-classical character. It shows a pronounced enhancement with decreasing flake thickness, which correlates with an increasing hole-to-electron concentration ratio. This distinctive thickness dependence suggests an origin in the nonlinear band effects near the Dirac point, likely driven by the shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strengthening of MR anisotropic with enhanced inter-layer transport contradicts the prediction of the guiding-center diffusion model for three-dimensional systems. Our findings highlight the critical roles of band topology and structural dimensional in the anomalous magneto-transport of Dirac semi-metals.</p>

            <h2>Lattice Translation Modulated Symmetries and TFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ching-Yu Yao</p>
            <p>Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that are not invariant under spacetime symmetry actions. We propose a general way to describe the lattice translation modulated symmetries in 1+1D, including the non-invertible ones, via the tensor network language. We demonstrate that the modulations can be described by some autoequivalences of the categories. Although the topological behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories. This structure not only recovers some known results on invertible modulated symmetries but also provides a general framework to tackle modulated symmetries in a more general setting.</p>

            <p>Coherence is a key property of quantum systems, and it plays a central role in the operation and performance of quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath. The system is formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.</p>

            <p>Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region.</p>

            <h2>Arbitrary Control of Non-Hermitian Skin Modes via Disorder and An Electric Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Yang Li, Yu-Ran Zhang, Xiaomin Wei, Zhongmin Yang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the accumulation of a macroscopic number of bulk states at system boundaries, is a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics. However, effective control of skin-mode localization in higher-dimensional systems remains a significant challenging. Here, we propose a versatile approach to manipulate the localization of skin modes in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices by combining disorder with a static electric field. While the electric field alone suppresses the NHSE in a clean system, the introduction of disorder induces transverse wave-packet transport perpendicular to the field. In nonreciprocal lattices, when the nonreciprocal hopping is misaligned with the electric field, the hopping component perpendicular to the field guides wave-packet propagation and produces boundary localization. By tuning the relative orientation between the electric field and the nonreciprocal hopping direction, the boundary localization position can be continuously and arbitrarily controlled. We further demonstrate distinct geometry-dependent manipulation of skin modes in reciprocal lattices, where controllable boundary localization emerges solely from the lattice geometry. These results establish a robust and tunable mechanism for engineering boundary accumulation and directed transport in non-Hermitian systems, offering new opportunities for applications in classical platforms and quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Tailoring at will polar textures in ferroelectrics is critical for the development of nanoscale electronics and functional oxide technologies. Freestanding ferroelectric membranes have enabled studies of strain-induced polarization responses, but the control over membrane shape and local polarization typically remains limited to spontaneous buckling or uniaxial mechanical deformations. In this work, we employ a versatile photosensitive-polymer patterning approach to impose programmable bending strain profiles in ferroelectric membranes. Using BaTiO3 as a model system, we demonstrate deterministic 90° polarization rotation driven by engineered in-plane strain, and 180° polarization reversal arising from flexoelectric coupling through a controlled strain gradient. These results establish this programmable bending as a powerful approach to investigate strain-dependent domain structures, leverage flexoelectric effects, and engineer custom ferroelectric landscapes across a wide range of oxide membranes.</p>

Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits.</p>

            <p>Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.</p>

            <p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening analysis remains a cornerstone for quantifying crystallite size and lattice microstrain in materials. Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. However, this study reveals that the equation most commonly applied in SSP analysis is dimensionally inconsistent, a critical flaw that has gone largely unnoticed and replicated across decades of materials research. This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \en</p>

            <p>Intense terahertz (THz) pulses induce transient inversion-symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$, yet the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Using fields up to $\sim$1.1 MV/cm, we reveal spatially inhomogeneous THz-field-induced second harmonic generation (TFISH) governed by competing lattice and defect dynamics. Short-lived coherent antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes suppress dipole correlations within $\sim$5 ps, while heavily damped soft/AFD modes and a defect-induced low-frequency mode ($\sim$0.1-0.3 THz) jointly prevent long-range ferroelectric coherence in oxygen-vacancy-rich regions. Collective modes manifested by oscillatory TFISH components exhibit softening followed by hardening below a critical temperature $T^*\simeq$28 K, confirming transient ferroelectric order where defects are sparse. These results reconcile conflicting interpretations, establish defect-mediated competition as a central regulator of light-induced ferroelectricity, and open routes to ultrafast control of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.</p>

Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

            <p>We employ cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) to systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under ambient pressure. By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.</p>

            <p>Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.</p>

We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments.</p>

The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}>0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Revealing interstitial energetics in Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy via universal machine learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Veronika Mazáčová, Petr Vlčák</p>
            <p>Understanding the behavior of light interstitial elements in multicomponent alloys remains challenging due to the complexity of local chemical environments and the high computational cost of first-principles calculations. Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability.</p>

            <h2>Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakhar A. Iakovlev, Akashdeep Kamra, Mikhail M. Glazov</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianqi Chen, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee, Bo Yang, Raditya Weda Bomantara</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David T. Stephen, Oliver Hart</p>
            <p>In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries, including anomalous and non-invertible symmetries, and also serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. We also discuss constraints on SIMPS fusion and propose a general framework for fusion that encompasses the MPS and SIMPS protocols. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu</p>
            <p>We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</p>

            <h2>Fast training and sampling of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Béreux, Aurélien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Lorenzo Rosset, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting insights from data, but their training is hindered by the slow mixing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) processes, especially with highly structured datasets. In this study, we build on recent theoretical advances in RBM training and focus on the stepwise encoding of data patterns into singular vectors of the coupling matrix, significantly reducing the cost of generating new samples and evaluating the quality of the model, as well as the training cost in highly clustered datasets. The learning process is analogous to the thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. We leverage the continuous transitions in the training process to define a smooth annealing trajectory that enables reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimates. This approach enables online assessment during training and introduces a novel sampling strategy called Parallel Trajectory Tempering (PTT) that outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. To mitigate the critical slowdown effect in the early stages of training, we propose a pre-training phase. In this phase, the principal components are encoded into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process, facilitating efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. Our results demonstrate that this pre-training strategy allows RBMs to efficiently handle highly structured datasets where conventional methods fail. Additionally, our log-likelihood estimation outperforms computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios, while the PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to conventional methods.</p>

Compact models for all process corners are extracted from TCAD-generated target characteristics, enabling accurate cryogenic modeling without dedicated foundry support. This scalable, technology-independent method provides a practical path for cryogenic circuit design.</p>

            <p>The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sylvain Lannebère, Nader Engheta, Mário G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in non-Hermitian phenomena in low-symmetry conductors, particularly optical gain driven by electro-optic effects. Conventional semiclassical treatments typically attribute these effects to nonlinear interactions associated with the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons. Here, we present a phenomenological microscopic model that not only recovers these anomalous-velocity contributions, but also incorporates interband effects that become significant at higher frequencies. Our model captures a wide range of nonlinear interactions while remaining consistent with passivity and microscopic reversibility. Using this broader framework, we study the nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons as an alternative mechanism for optical gain. We show that, under non-equilibrium conditions in low-symmetry conductors, the linearized electromagnetic response can exhibit both nonreciprocity and gain, even without anomalous velocity contributions. Finally, we analyze the stability of electrically biased systems and highlight potential applications such as optical isolators and traveling-wave amplifiers.</p>

            <p>Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</p>

            <p>Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <p>We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</p>

            <p>Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.</p>

Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys.

The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0>$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1>$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0>$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0>$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0>$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</p>

            <p>This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free or clamped edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.</p>

            <h2>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khushi Banthia, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</p>

            <h2>Mixed-State Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Imaginary-Time Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Xu Tian, Zhe Wang, Yanzhang Zhu, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</p>

            <h2>On-Chip Levitated Neon Particle Arrays for Robust and Scalable Electron Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sosuke Inui, Yinghe Qi, Yiming Xing, Charles Peretti, Dafei Jin, Wei Guo</p>
            <p>Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to variable qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model.

We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p>

            <h2>Cavity based sensing of antiferromagnetic canting and nonzero-momentum spin waves in a van der Waals cavity-magnon-polariton system</h2>

            <p>Cavity-magnon-polaritons are hybrid excitations from the interaction between cavity photons and magnons, the quanta of collective spin oscillations. Along with the tunability of the magnon-photon coupling strength, fast information transfer and conversion speed are desired in hybrid devices. This can be achieved utilizing the propagating nature of spin waves with non-zero momentum for their ultra-fast time dynamics and reduced ohmic dissipation. Antiferromagnets are particularly interesting as hosts for magnons since stray-field interactions are minimized, and they support multiple modes with distinctive magnetic-field behavior across the phase diagram. CrCl3 is a van der Waals antiferromagnet having a strong easy-plane anisotropy and a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. Despite some magnetic resonance studies, the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength as a function of magnetic field remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator as a function of magnetic field. In particular, we find that the magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically and distinctly with the magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons, enabling tuning of the coupling strength with an external magnetic field as a knob. We find the signature of spin-flop transition in two harmonics of the cavity due to a stronger dispersive coupling between optical magnons and cavity photons at lower fields. Additionally, we find standing modes formed by spin waves with nonzero momentum associated with the two hybrid magnons when the external field is applied at an angle with the crystal plane. These modes do not undergo substantial coupling with the cavity mode unlike the antiferromagnetic modes and can be used as low-loss propagation channels in hybrid devices.</p>

            <p>Indium antimonide (InSb) is a fundamental material for infrared radiation detectors based on interband transitions. Its narrow bandgap enables detection of infrared radiation within the $3-5 \mu m$ atmospheric window, while its high quantum efficiency ensures excellent sensitivity in InSb-based detectors. We propose a plasmonic structure that significantly enhances infrared absorption in an ultrathin InSb film. The resonant characteristics of this plasmonic enhancement effect could serve as a foundation for developing highly sensitive multi-color detectors.</p>

            <p>The dynamic reconstruction of surfaces during electrochemical reactions plays a crucial role in determining the performance of electrocatalysts. However, because reconstructions occur at the atomic level, direct observation and elucidation of the underlying mechanism are challenging for conventional powder type catalysts with ill defined lattices. In this study, the catalytically active surface of 3C BaRuO3 (BRO) epitaxial thin films emerges upon the dynamic introduction of surface Ru clusters, for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the mass activity at overpotential 100 mV, the intrinsic HER performance increases dramatically from 0.11 to 7.72 A/mg immediately after the initial HER cycle and eventually saturates at 1.05 A/mg after continuous operation. The formation of Ru clusters on the catalyst surface, driven by selective Ba leaching under alkaline HER conditions, is observed experimentally. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that HER activity increased with enhanced H* adsorption owing to the dynamic Ru6 cluster formation. A strategy for stabilizing the 'awakened' active surface of BRO is further proposed by validating that the atomic-scale control of the film thickness can effectively maintain the highly active state. This study offers fundamental insights into the design and stabilization of the highly active Ru-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER.</p>

            <p>A15 superconductors are distinguished by their high critical temperatures, magnetic fields, and current-carrying capabilities. Among them, Nb$_3$Al is of particular interest for superconducting quantum circuits as a means to extend device operating temperatures, provided that its electrodynamic properties are well understood. Here, we report on the synthesis of Nb$_3$Al thin films by magnetron co-sputtering followed by rapid thermal processing, yielding superconducting transition temperatures above 16~K. Microwire devices patterned from these films exhibit a coherence length of $3.2\,\mathrm{nm}$ and superfluid densities as low as $1.1\times 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, suggesting that Nb$_3$Al may enable high kinetic inductance in thinner films. Coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on Nb$_3$Al demonstrate single-photon internal quality factors up to $2.26\times 10^{5}$. These results establish Nb$_3$Al as a promising material platform for the development of superconducting quantum circuits operating at elevated temperatures, contingent on appropriate control of interfacial chemistry and surface morphology.</p>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect is one of the nonreciprocal transport phenomena, where the critical current depends on the current direction. This effect is typically realized in superconductors with broken spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry. To break the time-reversal symmetry, external magnetic fields are commonly used. Here, we demonstrate a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect under zero external magnetic field in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$. The sign of the zero-field superconducting diode effect is controlled by the poling magnetic field, that is a large magnetic field applied prior to measurements. This result indicates that trapped magnetic flux are responsible for breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Our findings highlight the crucial role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the superconducting diode effect and provide a general pathway for realizing a zero-field superconducting diode effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianghui Meng, Yanqing Shen, Xin Yang, Xinyu Wang, Qing Ai, Yong Shuai, Zhongxiang Zhou</p>
            <p>Traditionally, strong quantum anharmonic effects have been considered a characteristic of hydrogen-rich compounds. Here we propose that these effects also play a decisive role in boron-carbon clathrates. The stability and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of carbon-boron clathrates XYB6C6, whose metal atoms have an average oxidation state of +1.5, have long remained under debate. At this oxidation state, some combinations (e.g., RbSrB6C6) are dynamically stable, whereas others (e.g., RbPbB6C6) are not. Using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation combined with machine learning, we find that the anharmonicity originates primarily from guest metal atoms. For comparison, we find that quantum fluctuations have negligible influence on SrB3C3, but remove the lattice instability of RbPbB6C6. The predicted Tc of RbPbB6C6 (88 K) is nearly twice that of SrB3C3. Moreover, RbPbB6C6 exhibits two-gap superconductivity due to the higher C/B ratio in the density of states at the Fermi level compared to SrB3C3, weakening the sp3 hybridization. These findings demonstrate that quantum anharmonicity crucially governs the stability and superconductivity of XYB6C6 clathrates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakhar A. Iakovlev, Akashdeep Kamra, Mikhail M. Glazov1</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</p>

            <p>We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate in a Majorana-encoded logical space simulated on a photonic platform. Instead of implementing physical Majorana quasiparticles, our experiment emulates the algebra of Majorana zero modes using photonic degrees of freedom obtained through a Jordan-Wigner mapping. This mapping enables us to simulate two logical qubits, encoded in three Kitaev chains supporting endpoint Majorana operators. Moreover, we realise the unitary representations of both intra-chain and inter-chain Majorana braiding operations that implement the encoded CNOT gate. Due to hardware constraints, the full braiding sequence is executed through a cyclic input-output procedure, requiring an indirect reconstruction of accumulated noise across successive steps. We numerically show that the Majorana encoding offers resilience to the dominant noise in our photonic setup, provided the physical error rate stays below a well-defined threshold. As our experimental error rate (p=0.012) lies beneath this threshold, the experimentally measured encoded CNOT fidelity is significantly enhanced, exceeding 0.992. This reveals a novel pathway to fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Majorana-inspired encodings, even in the absence of full topological protection.</p>

Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6.

These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters. Our results highlight the possibilities in the new field of Andreev optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Despite the decades that have passed since the discovery of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and its apparent simplicity, this method is still often subject to experimental errors and misinterpretations when applied to 2D semiconductors. The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles study of the nonlinear optical properties of sliding ferroelectric bilayers based on MoSe$_2$ and Janus MoSSe. Two Janus configurations are considered: i) one bilayer where the two intralayer polarizations caused by Janus chemical asymmetry cancel each other out, yielding photocurrent spectra comparable to pristine MoSe$_2$ bilayers; ii) another bilayer where the intralayer polarizations add up, for which the photoresponses are strongly enhanced. Our results show that photocurrent generation in the polar Janus structures is predominantly governed by vertical chemical asymmetry, with limited dependence on the sliding direction. These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range.

            <h2>Exciton fractional Chern insulators in moiré heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raul Perea-Causin, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz</p>
            <p>Moiré materials have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. While recent experiments have unveiled fractional Chern insulators exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect based on electrons or holes, the exploration of analogous many-body states with bosonic constituents remains largely uncharted. In this work, we predict the emergence of bosonic fractional Chern insulators arising from long-lived excitons in a moiré superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ stacked on monolayer MoSe$_2$. Performing exact diagonalization on the exciton flat Chern band present in this structure, we provide compelling evidence for the existence of Abelian and non-Abelian phases at band filling $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$, respectively, through multiple robust signatures including ground-state degeneracy, spectral flow, many-body Chern number, and particle-cut entanglement spectrum. The obtained energy gap of $\sim 10$ meV for the Abelian states suggests a remarkably high stability of this phase, which persists for a relatively wide range of twist angles and vertical electric fields. Our findings establish the presence of robust bosonic fractional Chern insulators in highly tunable and experimentally accessible moiré heterostructures and unveil a promising pathway for realizing non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <h2>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongjun Park, Eun-Gook Moon</p>
            <p>The ground state of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid on a honeycomb lattice is an intriguing many-body state characterized by its topological order and massive entanglement. One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of O(N) with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.</p>

            <p>The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</p>

            <h2>Strain Response as a Probe of Spinons in Quantum Spin Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Penghao Zhu, Archisman Panigrahi, Leonid Levitov, Nandini Trivedi</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.</p>

            <p>Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic Theory of the Ultrafast Optical Response of 2D-Quantum-Confined Semiconductors at Elevated Densities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry Mittenzwey, Oliver Voigt, Andreas Knorr</p>
            <p>An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.</p>

This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters. Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 200 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongpan Li, Yichen Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu</p>
            <p>The ideal altermagnets are a class of collinear, crystal-symmetry-enforced fully compensated magnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands, in which contributions from Berry curvature to magneto-optical effects (MOEs) are strictly forbidden by an effective time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minakshi Subhadarshini, Amartya Pal, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical framework to engineer hybrid-order and higher-order topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulators by coupling to $d$-wave altermagnets (AMs). Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications.</p>

            <h2>Tuning spin currents in collinear antiferromagnets and altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjan Sheoran, Pratibha Dev</p>
            <p>Spin current generation through non-relativistic spin splittings, found in uncompensated magnets and d-wave altermagnets, is desirable for low-power spintronics. Such spin currents, however, are symmetry forbidden in conventional collinear antiferromagnets and higher-order altermagnets. Using spin point group analysis, we demonstrate that finite spin currents can be induced in these materials via magnetoelectric, piezomagnetic, and piezomagnetoelectric-like couplings. We utilize electric fields, strain, and their combinations to drive symmetry-lowering phase transitions into uncompensated magnetic or d-wave altermagnetic states, thereby enabling finite spin conductivity in a broader class of magnetic materials. We further substantiate this framework using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport calculations on representative magnetic materials - KV2Se2O, RuF4 , Cr2O3 , FeS2 , and MnPSe3 - spanning these different cases. The charge-to-spin conversion ratio reaches up to almost 100% via uncompensated magnetism and about 40% via d-wave altermagnetism under realistic conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach for efficient spin current generation.</p>

            <p>The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport phenomena provide a direct probe of band quantum geometry in noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials, such as the nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole. In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses. Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.</p>

            <h2>Speciation and hydration forces in sodium carbonate/bicarbonate aqueous solutions nanoconfined between mica sheets</h2>

            <p>The equilibrium between hydrated and hydrolysed forms of CO2 in water is central to a multitude of processes in geology, oceanography and biology. Chemistry of the carbonate system is well understood in bulk solution, however processes such as mineral weathering and biomineralisation frequently occur in nano-confined spaces where carbonate chemistry is less explored. For confined systems, the speciation equilibria are expected to tilt due to surface reactivity, electric fields and reduced configurational entropy. In this discussion paper we provide measurements of interaction force between negatively charged aluminosilicate (mica) sheets across aqueous carbonate/bicarbonate solutions confined to nanoscale films in equilibrium with a reservoir of the solution. By fitting the measurements to a Poisson-Boltzmann equation modified to account for charge regulation at the bounding walls, we discuss features of the bicarbonate speciation in confinement. We find that (i) the presence of bicarbonate in the bulk reservoir causes a repulsive excess pressure in the slit compared to pH-neutral salt solutions at the same concentration, arising from a higher (negative) effective charge on the mica surfaces; (ii) the electrostatic screening length is lower for solutions of Na2CO3 compared to NaHCO3 at the same bulk concentration, due to a shift in the speciation equilibria with pH and in accordance with Debye-Hückel theory; (iii) hydration forces are observed at distances below 2 nm with features of size 0.1 nm and 0.3 nm; this was reproducible across the various bicarbonate electrolytes studied, and contrasts with hydration forces of uniform step size measured in pH-neutral electrolytes.</p>

In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</p>

            <p>High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is crucial for observing material's structural and morphological evolution at Angstrom scales, but the electron beam can alter these processes. Devices such as CMOS-based direct-electron detectors operating in electron-counting mode can be utilized to substantially reduce the electron dosage. However, the resulting images often lead to low signal-to-noise ratio, which requires frame integration that sacrifices temporal resolution. Several machine learning (ML) models have been recently developed to successfully denoise HRTEM images. Yet, these models are often computationally expensive and their inference speeds on GPUs are outpaced by the imaging speed of advanced detectors, precluding in situ analysis. Furthermore, the performance of these denoising models on datasets with imaging conditions that deviate from the training datasets have not been evaluated. To mitigate these gaps, we propose a new self-supervised ML denoising pipeline specifically designed for time-series HRTEM images. This pipeline integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network with pre-processing and post-processing steps including drift correction and low-pass filtering. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms various other ML and non-ML denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features. Additionally, the model is drastically faster than U-Net-based ML models and demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution generalization. The model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds per image, rendering it suitable for application in in-situ HRTEM experiments.</p>

            <p>Two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers have been known for decades, yet their experimental realization remained limited to low-order fractions. Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $\nu = 1$, from both $\nu = 2/3$ and $\nu = 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.</p>

            <p>Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM-FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM-FM technologies.</p>

For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating the computational design and production of materials. In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 °C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 °C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.</p>

The costly computational steps are identical to those for KPM, with high-order accuracy achieved by an inexpensive post-processing procedure. We apply the algorithm to tight-binding models of graphene and twisted bilayer graphene, demonstrating high-order convergence to the LDOS at non-singular points.</p>

We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.</p>

            <h2>Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avik Banerjee, Giuseppe Policastro</p>
            <p>Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.</p>

            <h2>Excess work in counterdiabatic driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas P. Kamizaki, Marcus V. S. Bonança</p>
            <p>Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.</p>

            <h2>Hybridized-Mode Parametric Amplifier in Kinetic-Inductance Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danial Davoudi, Abdul Mohamed, Shabir Barzanjeh</p>
            <p>Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Universally Converging Representations of Matter Across Scientific Foundation Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sathya Edamadaka, Soojung Yang, Ju Li, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli</p>
            <p>Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics of Chemical Bond Formation: Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialong Shi, Lingjun Zhu, Florian Nitz, Oliver Bünermann, Alec M. Wodtke, Hua Guo, Bin Jiang</p>
            <p>A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack J. Turner, Christian W. Binder, Guido Burkard, Andrew J. Fisher</p>
            <p>Extensive theoretical and experimental work has established high-fidelity electron shuttling in Si/SiGe systems, whereas demonstrations in Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) remain at an early stage. To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures.</p>

            <p>For a subclass of a general $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Hamiltonian obeying anti-commutation relation with its conjugate, a Hermitian basis is found that spans the bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors. Using the modified projectors constructed from these eigenvectors, the generalized density matrix of the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric evolution is calculated, and subsequently, ergotropy for a closed system is obtained. The $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system, in an open system scenario, is studied to understand ergotropy under different regimes of non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian. The consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics for the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system in an open system scenario is also analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Inner structure of the many-body localization transition and the fulfillment of the Harris criterion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</p>
            <p>We treat the disordered Heisenberg model in 1D as the standard model of many-body localization (MBL). Two new and independent order parameters stemming solely from the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}$ are introduced to probe the eigenstate phase transition in this model. From the symmetry-endowed entropy decomposition, they are the probability distribution deviation $|d(p_n)|$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ of the maximally dimensional symmetry subdivision. The finite-size scaling reveals that $\{p_n\}$ drives the localization transition, preceded by a thermalization breakdown transition governed by $\{S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}\}$. For the noninteracting case, these transitions coincide, but in the interacting circumstance they separate. Such separability creates an intermediate phase regime and discriminates between the Anderson and MBL transitions. One obstacle whose solution eludes the community to date concerns the violation of the Harris criterion in most numerical investigations of MBL. Upon elucidating the mutually independent measures comprising $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, it becomes clear that the previous studies may lack the resolution to pinpoint thus potentially overlook the crucial internal structure of the transition. We show that after this necessary decomposition, the universal critical exponents for both transitions of $|d(p_n)|$ and $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ fulfill the Harris criterion: $\nu\approx2\ (\nu\approx1.5)$ for quench (quasirandom) disorder. Our work puts forth symmetry combined with entanglement as an organization principle for the generic eigenstate matter and phase transition.</p>

We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</p>

            <p>In Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), spin-orbit coupling (SOC) produces supersolidity. It is a peculiar state of matter, which, in addition to the superfluid behaviour shows periodic density modulation typical for crystals. Here, we report the fabrication of a new type of optical microcavity allowing to achieve room-temperature supersolidity for a quantum fluid of light. The microcavity is filled with a nematic liquid crystal (LC) and two layers of the organic polymer MeLPPP hosting exciton resonances. We demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in the two distinct degenerate minima of the dispersion created by the LC induced Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) SOC. The condensate real-space distribution shows density stripes located randomly from one condensate realization to another despite the presence of a random disorder potential. This demonstrates the immunity of stripes against disorder (that is, superfluidity) and the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. We also report the random appearance of vortices via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, another smoking gun of superfluidity.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbitronics, based on both spin and orbital angular momentum, presents a promising pathway for energy-efficient memory and logic devices. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of orbital currents in light transition metals such as Ti, Cr, and Zr, broadening the scope of spin-orbit torque (SOT). In particular, the orbital Hall effect, which arises independently of spin-obit coupling, has shown potential for enhancing torque efficiency in spintronic devices. However, the direct integration of orbital current into magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) remains unexplored. In this work, we design a light metal/heavy metal/ferromagnet multilayer structure and experimentally demonstrate magnetization switching by orbital current. Furthermore, we have realized a robust SOT-MRAM cell by incorporating a reference layer that is pinned by a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure. We observed a tunnel magnetoresistance of 66%, evident in both magnetic field and current-driven switching processes. Our findings underscore the potential for employing orbital current in designing next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive- searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Phonons are ubiquitous quasiparticles in solid state systems describing the quantized vibrations of a crystal lattice. Phonons play a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena, from transport to symmetry-breaking orders, such as charge density waves and superconductivity. {Traditionally treated as spin-0 bosons that obey Bose-Einstein statistics,} phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring topological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band theory initially formulated for fermionic systems. {It is now understood that the phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can carry nontrivial topological invariants, including the Berry phase and Chern number. This new understanding opens up avenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and chirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of topological phonons and circularly polarized phonons. We introduce foundational concepts, including the classification of phononic band structures, symmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological invariants in bosonic systems. We emphasize the concept of phonon angular momentum and its fundamental connection to Weyl phonons in $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking systems. Key experimental progresses on topological and circularly polarized phonons are discussed. We also outline outstanding challenges and promising directions for future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated quasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum for potential applications in quantum technologies.}</p>

            <p>We study a finite-length Kitaev chain coupled to a single mode photonic cavity. The topological phase of the finite-length Kitaev chain is characterized by the presence of fermion parity switching points that correspond to the degeneracy between even and odd parity ground states. Using exact diagonalization, we compute the many-body energy spectrum of the electron-photon Hamiltonian and we find that the ground state in the topological phase of the Kitaev chain is only weakly affected by the cavity coupling. This is in contrast with the excited states showing strong dependence on the cavity frequency. We find that the photon number and the photonic field quadratures peak at values of the chemical potential corresponding to parity switching points revealing a property of the finite-length Kitaev chain in the topological phase. This later finding suggests that quantum optics experiments could be used to detect topological features of the Kitaev chain embedded into a photonic cavity. Moreover, calculations of photonic quadratures reveal squeezed states that are both captured by the exact diagonalization technique and mean field decoupling. However, the mean field approach fails to correctly capture the photonic probability in the odd photonic states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Du, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.</p>

            <h2>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rule Yi, Violet Williams, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, {which persists at finite temperature}. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.</p>

What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter space where these local minima are clearly associated with d-wave condensates of the form $d_{x^2-y^2}$ in the underdoped region. There are, however, indications of $d_{xy}$ condensation in the overdoped region, at least in this approximation to the 2D Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>The complex phase diagram of 1T-TiSe2 consists of a charge density wave (CDW) below 200 K, and CDW fluctuations of still unknown origin at higher temperatures. Here, we use time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy and density functional perturbation theory to uncover the formation mechanism of CDW fluctuations and their spectral features at 295 K. We investigated the transient dynamics of fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation, and directly correlate it with the CDW soft-phonon hardening. Surprisingly, our results show that the coherent amplitude mode modulating ultrafast CDW recovery persists above TCDW, and reveal that CDW fluctuations are dominated by the electron-phonon interaction rather than excitonic correlations as commonly believed. Our findings on these microscopic CDW fluctuations clarify the complex interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, could be useful in understanding the nature of the CDW phase transition in 1T-TiSe2 and similar quantum materials.</p>

            <p>High entropy metal nitrides are an important material class in a variety of applications, and the role of nitrogen vacancies is of great importance for understanding their stability and mechanical properties. We study six different high entropy nitrides with eight different metal species to build a predictive model of the nitrogen vacancy formation energy. We construct sets of supercells that maximize the number of unique nitrogen environments for a given chemistry, and then use density-functional theory to calculate the energy density for all nitrogen sites, and the vacancy formation energies for the highest, lowest, and a median subset based on the energy densities. The energy density of nitrogen sites correlates with the vacancy formation energies, for binary, ternary and high entropy nitrides. A linear regression model predicts the vacancy formation energies using only the nearest-neighbor composition; across our eight metals, we find the largest vacancy formation energies next to Hf, then Zr, Ti, V, Cr, Ta, Nb, and the lowest near Mo. Additionally, we see that binary nitride data shows qualitatively similar vacancy formation energy trends for high entropy nitrides; however, the binary data alone is insufficient to predict the complex nitride behavior. Our model is both predictive and easily interpretable, and correlates with experimental data.</p>

The central finding is the demonstration of differential optical control: the charge order is fragile, completely suppressed by a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, while the SDW is remarkably robust, persisting to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$. This work establishes a clear hierarchy in the stability of competing electronic orders and provides a powerful method for disentangling their interplay in quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H.J.H. Brouwers</p>
            <p>In this paper the random packing fraction of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean space RD is studied using two statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4 resulting from integral geometry are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for (sphero-)cylinders (D = 3) and rectangles (D = 2), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. This allows the derivation of closed-form and generic expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4.</p>

            <h2>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoi Koide, Armin van de Venn</p>
            <p>We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</p>

            <h2>When Heating Isn't Cooling in Reverse: Nosé-Hoover Thermostat Fluctuations from Equilibrium Symmetry to Nonequilibrium Asymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hesam Arabzadeh, Brad Lee Holian</p>
            <p>Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\langle \xi_x \rangle / \langle \xi_y \rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings.</p>

            <h2>Predictive quantum vibrational spectra through active learning 4G-NNPs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Omar Faruque, Dil K. Limbu, Nathan London, Mohammad R. Momeni</p>
            <p>Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed-phase and interface systems with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface test cases, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer effects from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. The framework introduced in this work is simple and general, offering a practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and ad hoc fitting.</p>

            <p>We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1° (below), to 20° (above) the van Hove singularity with 7° and 9° samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9° sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yulu Ren, Yang Shen, Chengyang Xu, Wanfei Shan, Weidong Luo</p>
            <p>ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states of Path-structured Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> El-kaïoum M. Moutuou, Habib Benali</p>
            <p>The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives interaction pathways between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph C*-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger (TCK) algebra, which captures the diversity of path-structured flow connectivity. Equipped with the gauge action, the TCK algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of potential flow pathways within the network. Specifically, the KMS states of this system represent the stationary distributions of a non-Markovian stochastic process with memory decay, capturing how influence propagates along exponentially weighted paths, and yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions. Applied to the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network, our framework reveals that neurolocomotor neurons emerge as the primary hubs of incoming path-structured flow at inverse temperatures where the entropy of KMS states peaks. This finding aligns with experimental evidence of the foundational role of locomotion in {\em C. elegans} behavior, suggesting that functional centrality may arise from the topological embedding of neurons rather than solely from local physiological properties. Our results highlight the potential of algebraic quantum methods and graph algebras to uncover patterns of functional organization in complex systems and neuroscience.</p>

            <p>Designing a miniature microscale engine that can override the role of thermal fluctuations has remained elusive and is an important open challenge. Here we provide the design and theoretical framework for a unique information-based engine - a work-to-work converter - comprising a sub-micron size bead and motor protein-microtubule (MT) complex in an optical trap setup. We demonstrate how by implementing a simple motor protein state-dependent feedback protocol of the optical trap stiffness, this engine is able to harness and convert the movement of a motor protein into work output. Unlike other conventional microengines, the fidelity and performance of this engine is determined by the stochasticity of motor (un)binding characteristics. We obtain an analytical form of the work distribution function, average work output and average power output, providing quantitative predictions for engine performance which are validated by stochastic simulations. Remarkably, the average work output per cycle is at least an order of magnitude higher than the thermal fluctuations and supersedes the performance of other microscale engines realized so far.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline E. P. Robin</p>
            <p>We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amer Alrakik, Gian Luigi Bendazzoli, Stefano Evangelisti, J. Arjan Berger</p>
            <p>We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</p>

            <p>Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and nonergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</p>

            <p>The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Jullière model, observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 and MP-20 datasets. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, one with enantiomorphs, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose new splits for datasets with polymorphs, ensuring that polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.</p>

Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.</p>

In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of strongly disordered spin chains in the presence of random local measurements. By studying the transverse-field Ising model with a site-dependent random longitudinal field and an effective $l$-bit many-body localized Hamiltonian, we show that the prethermal and MBL regimes are unstable to local measurements along any direction. Any non-zero measurement density induces a volume-law entangled phase with a subsequent phase transition into an area-law state as the measurement rate is further increased. The critical measurement rate $p_c$, where the transition occurs, is exponentially small in the strength of disorder $W$ and the average overlap between the measurement operator and the local integrals of motion $O$ as $p_c \sim \exp[-\alpha W/(1-O^2)]$. In the measurement-induced volume-law phase, the saturation time scales as $t_s \sim L $, contrasting the exponentially slow saturation $t_s \sim e^{aL}$ in the prethermal and MBL regimes at $p = 0$.</p>

Despite its relevance, an accurate ab-initio description of the optical absorption spectrum and of the impact of ferroelectric distortion on the excitonic properties is still lacking. We combine $G_0W_0$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation calculations to investigate the electronic and optical properties of PbTiO$_3$, tracking the evolution of its excitonic spectrum along the transition from the cubic paraelectric to the tetragonal ferroelectric phase. As the polar distortion increases, the first absorption peak of the cubic phase splits into two distinct features due to symmetry breaking, which partially lifts the degeneracy of the underlying excitonic state. Crucially, the distortion further introduces an in-plane/out-of-plane anisotropy in the spectra and controls the energy separation between the resulting excitonic branches. These findings highlight the potential for tuning the optical absorption properties of PbTiO$_3$ via the application of an external electric field.</p>

            <p>Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.</p>

Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions.

We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields.</p>

Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial.</p>

By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $\lambda=1.55$ $\mu$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenan Wei, Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity near an Ising nematic quantum critical point in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Huang, Zhao-Kun Yang, Jing-Rong Wang, Guo-Zhu Liu</p>
            <p>Near a two-dimensional Ising-type nematic quantum critical point, the quantum fluctuations of the nematic order parameter are coupled to the electrons, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between these two effects has been extensively studied through the Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap. However, previous studies often rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the results. Here, we re-visit the issue of how the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$ is affected by removing certain common approximations. We numerically solve the self-consistent Dyson-Schwinger equations of the electron propagator $G(p)$, the nematic propagator $D(q)$, and the vertex function $\Gamma_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{1L}}(p+q,p)$ expanded up to the triangle order, without introducing further approximations. Our calculations reveal that the extended $s$-wave superconducting gap is the only convergent solution to the nonlinear gap equations. We investigate the evolution of $T_{c}$ as the system approaches the nematic quantum critical point from the disordered (tetragonal) phase. Under the bare vertex approximation, $T_{c}$ is monotonically enhanced. However, when vertex corrections are incorporated, $T_{c}$ initially increases but then decreases, with the maximum value of $T_{c}$ occurring at a point away from the quantum critical point. The obtained gap symmetry and the non-monotonic behavior of $T_{c}$ are compared with recent experiments on doped FeSe materials.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Current-Induced Zero-Resistance State in Valley-Polarized Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase, K. T. Law</p>
            <p>The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. In the experiment, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or flows in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory of CIZRS. We show that the threefold degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized by the valley polarization and trigonal warping effects of twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Moreover, a current flowing in a particular direction breaks the threefold degeneracy and favors a particular FF pairing domain. We therefore propose that the incipient superconducting state is naturally understood as a multidomain state where the interdomain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta between different FF domains. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create monodomain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction can fail to generate the zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.</p>

            <h2>A thermodynamic framework for the thermal conductivity of dense fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Hoyuelos</p>
            <p>A thermodynamic framework that predicts the thermal conductivity $\lambda$ of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit is introduced. By generalizing the transition-rate approach of particles on a lattice to conserved quantities in continuous space, an expression for the ratio $\lambda/\lambda_{\rm id}$ is derived, where $\lambda_{\rm id}$ is the dilute-gas value; the ratio depends solely on equilibrium thermodynamic properties and is therefore directly computable from any equation of state. The resulting formula quantitatively reproduces simulation data for hard spheres throughout almost the entire fluid range, and captures the behavior of Lennard-Jones fluids in the supercritical region where thermodynamic fluctuations remain moderate. Comparison with experimental data for argon, reported by other authors, also shows good agreement. These results provide evidence that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal function of equilibrium thermodynamic properties.</p>

            <h2>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedetta Marmiroli, Sumea Klokic, Barbara Sartori, Marie Reissenbuechel, Alessio Turchet, Heinz Amenitsch</p>
            <p>Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</p>

            <p>Graphene plasmons confine incident terahertz fields far below the diffraction limit and, when hosted by a gate-defined Fabry-Perot cavity, enable electrically tunable, frequency-selective photodetectors. In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity.</p>

            <h2>Polar and apolar light-induced alignment of ferroelectric nematic at photosensitive polymer substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruslan Kravchuk, Oleksandr Kurochkin, Vassili G. Nazarenko, Volodymyr Sashuk, Mykola Kravets, Bijaya Basnet, Oleg D. Lavrentovich</p>
            <p>Surface alignment of a recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) is usually achieved by buffed polymer films, which produce a unidirectional polar alignment of the spontaneous electric polarization. We demonstrate that photosensitive polymer substrates could provide a wider variety of alignment modes. Namely, a polyvinyl cinnamate polymer film irradiated by linearly polarized ultraviolet (UV) light yields two modes of surface orientation of the NF polarization. (1) A planar apolar mode, in which the equilibrium NF polarization aligns perpendicularly to the polarization of normally impinging UV light; the NF polarization adopts either of the two antiparallel states. (2) A planar polar mode, produced by an additional irradiation with obliquely impinging UV light. In this mode, there is only one stable azimuthal direction of polarization in the plane of the substrate. The two modes differ in their response to an electric field. In the planar apolar mode, polarization can be switched between two states of equal surface energy. In the planar polar mode, the field-perturbed polarization relaxes back to the single photoinduced easy axis once the field is switched off. The versatility of modes and absence of mechanical contact make the photoalignment of the NF attractive for practical applications.</p>
