            <h2>Observation of Magnomechanics at Low Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Huang, P.M.C Rourke, A. Peruzzi, J. Jin, M. Ebrahimi, A. Rashedi, J. P. Davis</p>
            <p>Cavity magnomechanics combines strong coupling between magnons in a dielectric material and microwave cavity photons with long-lived mechanical resonances. Forming a triple resonance condition, this hybrid quantum system promises many advantages in quantum technologies, yet has never been studied at the cryogenic temperatures required to reveal such quantum properties. We report the first observation of magnomechanics at cryogenic temperatures down to 9 K. The experiment was conducted using a YIG sphere inside a microwave cavity, where we measured both the thermomechanical motion and the temperature-dependence of the magnon linewidth.</p>

            <h2>Metallicity-driven polar transitions in topological epilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo D. Stefanato, Nicolas M. Kawahala, Bianca A. Kawata, Paulo H. O. Rappl, Eduardo Abramof, Felix G. G. Hernandez</p>
            <p>Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic polarons due to spin-length fluctuations in $\boldsymbol{d}^\mathbf{4}$ spin-orbit Mott systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Revenda, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Jiří Chaloupka</p>
            <p>Mott insulators based on $4d$ and $5d$ transition-metal ions, where spin-orbit interaction plays a key role, can exhibit various forms of unusual magnetism. A particular example is the antiferromagnet Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ containing $d^4$ Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Here the spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the non-magnetic $J=0$ singlet ionic ground state, which gets dynamically mixed - via exchange interactions - with low-energy $J=1$ ionic excitations. Thanks to a sufficient strength of the exchange, these excitations condense and a long-range order emerges. The resulting ordered moments are soft and prone to fluctuations of their effective length. The corresponding amplitude mode appears as a prominent magnetic excitation and complements the conventional magnons involving rotations of the moments. Motivated by this peculiar kind of magnetic order and the specific spectrum of magnetic excitations, we study their influence on the propagation of doped carriers. To this end, we construct a microscopic model including both $d^4$ and $d^5$ degrees of freedom and address the propagation of an injected electron by employing self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the electron shows a combination of both free and a polaronic type of motion, where the mobile carrier strongly interacts with an accompanying cloud of magnetic excitations. Remarkably, in the latter case it is the exotic excitation - the amplitude mode - that is found to dominate over the contribution of magnons. Our soft-spin situation thus largely contrasts with spin polarons widely discussed in the context of doped Heisenberg-like magnets based on rigid spin moments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport in SnTe nanowire devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Femke J. Witmans, Mathijs G. C. Mientjes, Maarten J. G. Kamphuis, Vince van de Sande, Xin Guan, Hans Bolten, Marcel A. Verheijen, Chuan Li, Joost Ridderbos, Erik P. A. M. Bakkers, Alexander Brinkman, Floris A. Zwanenburg</p>
            <p>We report on a variety of quantum transport experiments in SnTe nanowire devices. Research on these particular nanowire devices is relevant because of their topological properties and their potential to distinguish surface states owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio that suppresses the bulk contribution to the conductance. We observe a low-resistance and a high-resistance regime. The highly resistive devices display semiconducting and quantum dot behavior caused by microscopic differences in the fabrication, while devices with low resistance show partial superconductivity when in a hybrid superconductor-nanowire configuration or Fabry-Pérot oscillations. The latter suggests quantum interference in a ballistic transport channel, attributed to the 2D surface states in SnTe. The wide variety of quantum transport phenomena demonstrate SnTe nanowires as a promising platform for diverse follow-up experiments and novel device architectures, including the exploration of topological superconductivity and the development of low-energy spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 by chemical pressure tuning of kagome flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Misawa, Markus Kriener, Rinsuke Yamada, Ryota Nakano, Milena Jovanovic, Leslie M. Schoop, Max Hirschberger</p>
            <p>In kagome metals, flat bands induced by frustrated hopping serve as a platform for strong electronic correlation, while often exhibiting substantial dispersion along the $k_z$ direction due to interlayer coupling. Here, we investigate the superconductivity of the kagome metal LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature. As supported by our first-principles calculations, the lattice expansion along the $c$-axis by chemical pressure mitigates a detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers, thereby reinforcing the three-dimensional localization of flat-band electrons. Providing evidence for LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ as a flat-band hosting superconductor, we demonstrate a simple, yet effective, route to engineer flat bands by uniaxial lattice expansion.</p>

            <h2>Toward single-photon detection with superconducting niobium diselenide nanowires</h2>

            <p>We present superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on few-layer NbSe$_2$ fully encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), demonstrating single-photon sensitivity. Our fabrication process preserves the superconducting properties of NbSe$_2$ in nanowires, as confirmed by low-temperature transport measurements that show a critical temperature of $T_c \approx 6.5$ K, comparable to the reported values for unpatterned sheets, and it maintains a contact resistance of $\sim 50 \, \Omega$ at $T = 4$ K. Meandered NbSe$_2$ nanowires exhibit a responsivity of up to $4.9 \times 10^4$ V/W over a spectral range of 650-1550 nm in a closed-cycle cryostat at 4 K, outperforming planar and short-wire devices. The devices achieve a $1/e$ recovery time of $\tau = (135 \pm 36)$ ns, system timing jitter of $j_\text{sys} = (1103 \pm 7)$ ps, and detection efficiency of $\sim 0.01\%$ at $0.95I_c$, with a linear increase in detection probability confirming the single-photon operation. Furthermore, measurements under attenuated pulsed laser (1 MHz) indicate a success rate of up to $33\%$ in detecting individual optical pulses, establishing the platform as a promising candidate for developing efficient single-photon detectors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junsen Wang, Xiangxiang Sun, Wei Zheng</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</p>

            <h2>Damped photonic modes in helicoidal graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdullah Guvendi, Omar Mustafa, Abdulkerim Karabulut</p>
            <p>We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helicoidal spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helicoidal graphene structures. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling the electronic, vibrational, thermodynamic, optical and piezoelectric properties of LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$ and Li$_2$NbTaO$_6$ from first-principles calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debidutta Pradhan, Rojalin Swain, Souvagya Kumar Biswal, Jagadish Kumar</p>
            <p>We have investigated the electronic, vibrational, optical, thermal and piezoelectric properties of LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$ and Li$_2$NbTaO$_6$ using the first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory. It also shows structural phase transition below $T_c$ due to ionic displacement that may alter the properties of material. We have checked the structural stability by calculating the tolerance factor and formation energy before proceeding to the further calculations. The ground state electronic band structures and corresponding density of states show its semiconducting nature with a band gap range of 3.5-3.7 eV. Optical properties such as dielectric function, absorption coefficient, optical conductivity, refractive index, absorbance and reflectance are calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties and Born effective charges were analyzed to find the correlation between them. In these materials, the distortion induced by the small ionic radius of Li$^{+}$ coupled with strong covalent interaction between transition metal and oxygen leads to high spontaneous polarization which can enhance both piezoelectric and optical properties.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneity, Fluctuations, and Gap Filling in Overdoped Cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Antonio Sulangi, Willem Farmilo, Andreas Kreisel, Mainak Pal, W. A. Atkinson, P. J. Hirschfeld</p>
            <p>Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and Predictions of New Kagome Flat Band Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junze Deng, Yi Jiang, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Haoyu Hu, Eeli O. Lamponen, Dumitru Călugăru, Hanqi Pi, Zhijun Wang, Maia G. Vergniory, Emilia Morosan, Titus Neupert, S. Blanco-Canosa, Claudia Felser, Kristjan Haule, Miguel A. L. Marques, Päivi Törmä, B. Andrei Bernevig</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation of the flat-band kagome superconductor LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, which has recently been reported to host charge density wave (CDW) order above room temperature ($T_{CDW} \simeq 400$ K). The stable crystal structure above the CDW transition is identified via soft phonon condensation and confirmed to be harmonically stable through ab initio calculations, consistent with recent X-ray diffraction refinements. The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is found to be mode-selective, primarily driven by strong interactions between Ru-$B_{3u}$ phonons (local $x$-direction, pointing toward the hexagon center) and Ru-$A_g$ electrons (local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital) within the kagome lattice. Using a spring-ball model, we identify this mode-selective EPC as a universal feature of kagome materials. Employing the newly developed Gaussian approximation of the hopping parameters, we derive an analytical expression for the EPC and demonstrate that superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is mostly driven by the coupling between the kagome $B_{3u}$ phonons and the $A_g$ electrons. The impact of doping is also investigated, revealing that light hole doping (approximately one hole per unit cell) significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ by 50%, whereas heavy doping induces structural instability and ferromagnetism. Furthermore, high-throughput screening identifies 3063 stable 1:3:2 kagome materials, of which 428 are predicted to exhibit superconductivity with $T_c > 1$ K, and the highest $T_c$ reaching 15 K. These findings establish LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and related materials as promising platforms for exploring the interplay among kagome flat bands, EPC, and superconductivity. Additionally, they may offer valuable insights into potential limitations on the $T_c$ of flat-band superconductivity in real materials.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics. This work paves the way for tunable quantum amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Vitrimer is an emerging class of sustainable polymers with self-healing capabilities enabled by dynamic covalent adaptive networks. However, their limited molecular diversity constrains their property space and potential applications. Recent development in machine learning (ML) techniques accelerates polymer design by predicting properties and virtually screening candidates, yet the scarcity of available experimental vitrimer data poses challenges in training ML models. To address this, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) data generated by our previous work to train and benchmark seven ML models covering six feature representations for glass transition temperature (Tg) prediction. By averaging predicted Tg from different models, the model ensemble approach outperforms individual models, allowing for accurate and efficient property prediction on unlabeled datasets. Two novel vitrimers are identified and synthesized, exhibiting experimentally validated higher Tg than existing bifunctional transesterification vitrimers, along with demonstrated healability. This work explores the possibility of using MD data to train ML models in the absence of sufficient experimental data, enabling the discovery of novel, synthesizable polymer chemistries with superior properties. The integrated MD-ML approach offers polymer chemists an efficient tool for designing polymers tailored to diverse applications.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Practical Capacitive Structures for Electronic and Dielectric Property Extraction and Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James G. Champlain, Vikrant J. Gokhale, Matthew T. Hardy, Eric N. Jin</p>
            <p>A method for modeling the full steady-state and small-signal behavior of practical capacitive structures, such as metal-insulator-metal capacitors, diodes, and transistors, is presented. Simple lumped element models fail to properly represent the behavior of most practical structures, resulting in incorrect electronic material property extraction and evaluation. The methodology and model presented in this paper properly characterizes practical structures and can be employed to more accurately understand and evaluate experimental results, extract various electronic and dielectric properties of the constituent materials, and predict possible behavior of new structures and materials. The impact of dielectric properties (e.g., real versus complex permittivity, conductance, Cole-Cole dielectric response) and geometry on observed behavior of practical structures, especially with regard to extracting correct property values, is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Monopole current control in artificial spin ice via localized fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Frank, Johan van Lierop, Robert L. Stamps</p>
            <p>Artificial spin ice systems are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets arranged on a lattice, exhibiting geometrical frustration and emergent phenomena such as monopole excitations. We explore magnetization dynamics and monopole current control in square artificial spin ice with added vertical control elements. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine how localized magnetic fields from these elements influence vertex configurations and domain propagation, enabling directional and polarity control of monopole currents. The control elements suppress monopole nucleation along one edge, steering monopole flow across the lattice, sometimes even against the applied field direction. These elements also reshape the system's energy landscape, producing tailored hysteresis and guided state transitions. Our results offer a strategy for manipulating collective behaviours in artificial spin ice using localized fields. This has implications for magnetic memory, physical reservoir computing, enabling reconfigurable magnetic logic and spin-based information processing, and device architectures requiring directional magnetic charge transport.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Berry phase contribution to Hall conductivity in CoS$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamal Kumar Dalui, Hari Paudyal, Durga Paudyal, Ramesh C Budhani</p>
            <p>In Weyl semi-metals, the conduction and valence bands intersect at distinct points on the Brillouin zone (Weyl points), which act as monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum space. This nontrivial band topology, identified from electronic structure calculations, gives rise to various exotic magneto-transport properties. Hybrid functional calculations that incorporate a portion of exact exchange, magneto-transport measurements, and temperature-dependent resistivity confirm nontrivial band topology and half-metallicity in CoS$_2$ of magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm C} \approx 120~\mathrm{K}$. However, electronic structure calculations also show that application of small strain transforms this half metallic character to the metallic. Interestingly, the magnetoresistance (MR) of the CoS$_2$ films is characterized by a reentrant weak localization above a critical field at $T \leq 60\,\mathrm{K}$ and a negative to positive transition in MR as the $T$ goes from $<T_{\rm C}$ to $>T_{\rm C}$. Experimental observation of anomalous Hall resistivity and $ab~initio$ computed band structure, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{xy}$) demonstrate that the $\sigma_{xy}$ in CoS$_2$ is primarily driven by the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger contribution, often linked to Berry phase physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zengxing Lu, Jiatai Feng, Xuan Zheng, You-guo Shi, Run-Wei Li, Carmine Autieri, Mario Cuoco, Milan Radovic, Zhiming Wang</p>
            <p>Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems at the interfaces of layered materials are highly desirable platforms for exploring of novel quantum phenomena and developing advanced device applications. Here, we investigate ultrathin heterostructures composed of SrIrO3 (SIO) and SrRuO3 (SRO) layers to uncover their emergent properties. Strikingly, despite the fact that both individual layers are antiferromagnetic insulators, the interfaced heterostructure exhibits emergent metallicity. Through transport measurements, magnetic characterization, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we analyze the underlying mechanisms governing this insulator-to-metal transition. Our findings reveal that the transition is driven by interface-induced magnetic reconstruction, which is further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the SIO/SRO interface is identified as the key driving force for this spin reorganization, as it stabilizes ferromagnetism in the coupled antiferromagnetic insulating layers. These findings highlight the significant potential of engineering interfacial magnetic interactions as a powerful approach to generate and control emergent electronic properties, paving the way for novel functionalities that are unattainable in individual ultrathin films.</p>

            <h2>Observation of charge to spin conversion in p-orbital InBi alloy</h2>

            <p>High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling, especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, the conflict between charge-to-spin conversion efficiency and spin transport ability is irreconcilable in d-orbital materials. Here, we report a large charge to spin conversion experimentally observed in the p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle comparable to heave metal Pt and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). First-principles calculations reveal that topological symmetry-protected gap opening near the Fermi level results in large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals and semimetal properties of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high-performance spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Valley-polarized Quantum Anomalous Hall and Topological Metal Phase in Rashba induced pseudospin-1 lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Puspita Parui, Bheema Lingam Chittari</p>
            <p>We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern numbers, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-1 system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</p>

            <p>In ultracold atomic gases, radio-frequency coupling between two spin states can lead to atoms being in a stable coherent superposition of the two states (dressed states). When the two-body interactions (scattering lengths) are different between the two states, it offers the possibility not only to control the interatomic interaction but also to modify the equation of states with emerging three-body terms with different signs and scalings with the parameters. We derive these terms in a unified perturbation framework and show that they correspond to genuine three-body processes found at different orders in perturbation theory. Our work justifies the introduction of contact three-body interactions in dressed-state systems when the spin degree of freedom is integrated out.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Alipourzadeh, Yaser Hajati</p>
            <p>Motivated by the orientation-dependent properties of d-wave superconductors (SCs), we investigate Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Josephson current in s-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (S/AM/D) and d-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (D/AM/D) junctions. The asymmetric S/AM/D junction exhibits a node-less ABSs spectrum with distinct spin states, arising from AM manipulation. In contrast, a symmetric D/AM/D junction with $\pm 45^\circ$-oriented order parameters exhibits a nodal ABSs spectrum, characterized by spin-split sinusoidal curves. This behavior arises from the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing potential, which introduces a $\pi$-shift in the ABSs spectrum of the D/AM/D junction compared to that of conventional S/AM/S junctions. Additionally, the positions of the ABSs nodes in the D/AM/D junction can be controlled by adjusting the length and strength of the AM layer. Analysis of the free energy and Josephson current reveals additional extrema in the free energy at intermediate phase differences, leading to skewness and a non-sinusoidal behavior in the current-phase relationship of both configurations. These zero-supercurrent phase differences can be tuned by adjusting the properties of the AM layer such as AM strength and length. These findings provide new insights into AM-based Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a notoriously complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies as well as the complex and periodically changing shapes of these meso-organisms add extra challenges for accurately modelling their dynamics. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to experimentally study the physics of biological meso-swimming dynamics. We directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia sp. and determine how the propulsive force scales with body size. We show that this scaling law is universal for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms, regardless of body shape, swimming strategy, or the addition of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we determine the time-reversal symmetry breaking of Artemia as it transitions from the viscous regime to the mesoscale. We discover that this model meso-swimmer achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous structural relaxation is intrinsic to glassy materials due to their metastable nature. For phase-change materials (PCMs), the resultant temporal change in electrical resistance seriously hamper in-memory computing (IMC) applications. Here, we report an ab-initio-calculation-informed design of amorphous PCM composed of robust "molecule-like" motifs with minimal Peierls distortion, depriving the amorphous alloy of structural ingredients that would gradually evolve upon aging to entail resistance drift. We demonstrate amorphous CrTe3 thin films that display practically no resistance drift at any working temperature from -200 to 165 degree C. We achieve multilevel programming of CrTe3 through both step-wise crystallization and step-wise amorphization using a hybrid opto-electronic device at various temperatures. Moreover, the application potential of CrTe3 in neuromorphic computing is testified by its incorporation in a vehicle with automatic path-tracking function. Our work opens a new avenue to achieving IMC-requisite properties via judicious design of the composition and atomic-level structure of disordered PCM alloys.</p>

            <p>UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in the local density of states on the UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap feature with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. Assisted by numerical simulations, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on the UTe2 (011) surface arise from the interplay between the gapless surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing and the vortex bound states because of the cylindrical squarish Fermi surface of UTe2. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex is strong evidence of the gapless surface states on UTe2 (011) surface, which rules out the possibility of B2u pairing symmetry.</p>

            <p>Flat bands in graphene-based moiré structures host a wide range of emerging strongly correlated and topological phenomena. Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moiré fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the first experimental observation of the long-lived prethermal phases with tunable heating rates in many-body systems, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by the $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and the subsystem entanglement entropy, we trace out the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and confirm the existence of the prethermal plateau. Its lifetime grows algebraically with the driving frequency and the scaling exponent is approximately $2n{+}1$, tunable by the multipolar order. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from the area-law to the volume-law entanglement scaling. We utilize all 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, and their entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work underscores superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</p>

            <h2>Superfluid density in linear response theory : pulsar glitches from the inner crust of neutron stars</h2>

            <p>The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.</p>

            <p>Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</p>

            <p>Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.</p>

Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</p>

            <p>The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.</p>

            <p>The $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid might realize an exotic phase of matter whose low-energy properties are described by quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions, where gapless modes exists but spinons and gauge fields are strongly coupled. Its existence has been proposed in frustrated Heisenberg models in presence of frustrating super-exchange interactions, by the (Abrikosov) fermionic representation of the spin operators [X.-G. Wen, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B {\bf 65}, 165113 (2002)}], supplemented by the Gutzwiller projection. Here, we construct charge-$Q$ monopole excitations in the Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with nearest- ($J_1$) and next-neighbor ($J_2$) couplings. In the highly frustrated regime, singlet and triplet monopoles with $Q=1$ become gapless in the thermodynamic limit; in addition, the energies for generic $Q$ agree with field-theoretical predictions, obtained for a large number of gapless fermion modes. Finally, we consider localized gauge excitations, in which magnetic $\pi$-fluxes are concentrated in the triangular plaquettes (in analogy with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ visons), showing that these kind of states do not play a relevant role at low energies. All our findings lend support to a stable $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice.</p>

            <p>In materials with one-dimensional electronic bands, electron-electron interactions can produce intriguing quantum phenomena, including spin-charge separation and charge density waves (CDW). Most of these systems, however, are non-magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr yields $Li_{0.17(2)} (tetrahydrofuran)_{0.26(3)} CrSBr$, which possess an electronically driven quasi-1D CDW with an onset temperature above room temperature. Concurrently, electron doping increases the magnetic ordering temperature from 132 K to 200 K and switches its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin-polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provides a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.</p>

            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. For a Fermi liquid, we find that the QFI grows quadratically as the temperature increases, consistent then with the phase space available for scattering in the standard theory of metals. By contrast, the QFI in a strange metal increases as a power law at as the temperature decreases, but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using density functional theory is crucial for optoelectronic applications. Standard hybrid functionals like HSE and PBE0 are becoming computationally accessible, yet can fail at predicting the band gaps for three-dimensional (3D) and/or layered halide perovskite. This study evaluates the doubly screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps of Pb- and Sn-based inorganic and hybrid 3D halide perovskites, as well as layered hybrid perovskites. The DSH functional employs material-dependent mixing parameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, and accurately predicts band gaps for 3D perovskites only if structural local disorder is taken into account. For layered hybrid perovskites, the DSH functional based on average dielectric constants tends to overestimate the band gaps. To improve predictions, we propose using the calculated dielectric constant of the respective 3D perovskites to define the DSH screening. This method is then applied to Pb- and Sn-based layered halide perovskites with various organic spacers and multilayered structures, such as $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with n =1, 2, 3, resulting in improved precision. The HSE functional systematically underestimates band gaps in layered perovskites due to the missing non-local long-range dielectric screening. On the other hand, the PBE0 is in good agreement with the experimental values, in particular for the layered iodide perovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient parameter-free \textit{ab initio} methodology suitable for predicting the electronic properties of 3D, layered halide perovskites and their heterostructures, towards modelling materials for advanced optoelectronic devices</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta</p>
            <p>We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</p>

            <p>The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.</p>

            <h2>Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitao He</p>
            <p>The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.</p>

            <h2>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Ohsawa, Andrea Richaud</p>
            <p>We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Floquet control of topological phases and Hall effects in Z2 nodal line semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pu Liu, Chaoxi Cui, Lei Li, Runze Li, Dong-Hui Xu, Zhi-Ming Yu</p>
            <p>Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.</p>

            <h2>Mixed radix numeration bases: Horner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damien Simon</p>
            <p>Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glen Evenbly, Nicola Pancotti, Ashley Milsted, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Trizio, Peilin Kang, Michele Parrinello</p>
            <p>The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</p>

            <h2>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Maillard</p>
            <p>Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta > 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau < \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau > \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau>\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</p>

            <h2>Geometry effect of the dynamical quantum phase transitions at finite temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) probe the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems, unveiling their geometric and topological characteristics. In this study, we introduce the concepts of parallel quench and dynamic geometrical order parameter (DGOP) for non-band models, where these quantities capture the geometric shifts associated with DQPTs. At zero temperature, the DGOP corresponds to the Pancharatnam geometric phase, while at finite temperatures, it extends to the interferometric geometric phase. We further generalize the dynamic topological order parameter (DTOP) to finite-temperature band models, examining its behavior in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our analysis shows that thermal fluctuations and boundary effects at finite temperatures disrupt the quantization of the DTOP, yet it retains signatures of topological transitions. These findings deepen the understanding of geometric and topological properties in quantum dynamics, illuminating DQPTs across both non-band and band frameworks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gert Aarts, Diaa E. Habibi, Lingxiao Wang, Kai Zhou</p>
            <p>To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions, under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</p>

            <p>Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</p>

            <p>Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Gross-Neveu-XY quantum criticality in moiré Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Hawashin, Michael M. Scherer, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional van-der-Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for engineering electronic band structures and interactions. By employing techniques such as twisting, gating, or applying pressure, these systems enable precise control over the electronic excitation spectrum. In moiré bilayer graphene, the tunability facilitates the transition from a symmetric Dirac semimetal phase through a quantum critical point into an interaction-induced long-range ordered phase with a finite band gap. At charge neutrality, the ordered state proposed to emerge from twist-angle tuning is the Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. In this case, the transition falls into the quantum universality class of the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY model in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we refine estimates for the critical exponents characterizing this universality class using an expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. We compute the order-parameter anomalous dimension $\eta_\varphi$ and the correlation-length exponent $\nu$ at one-loop order, and the fermion anomalous dimension $\eta_\psi$ at two-loop order. Combining these results with previous findings from the expansion around the upper critical dimension, we obtain improved estimates for the universal exponents in $2+1$ dimensions via Padé interpolation. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ four-component Dirac fermions, relevant to moiré bilayer graphene, we estimate $1/\nu=0.916(5)$, $\eta_\varphi=0.926(13)$, and $\eta_\psi=0.0404(13)$. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 2$, potentially relevant to recent tetralayer WSe$_2$ experiments, the Gross-Neveu-XY fixed point may be unstable due to a fixed-point collision at $N_\mathrm{f,c}$, with $N_\mathrm{f,c} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in the expansion around the lower critical dimension.</p>

            <h2>Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chaebin Kim, Martin Mourigal</p>
            <p>We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) S(q,w) of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, capturing the continuum of magnetic excitations observed in neutron scattering measurements. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions by De Gennes, where the pinched-oval spectral continuum reflects the uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Surprisingly, entanglement witnesses extracted from the quantum-equivalent DSSF mimic quantum calculations across all temperatures, despite relying on classical dynamics. However, classical simulations fail to reproduce higher energy spectral weight from spinon excitations at lower temperatures and struggle to explain the system behavior at intermediate temperatures and magnetic fields. Our approach highlights the potential of classical dynamics to emulate quantum effects even in the most extreme spin systems, with implications for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</p>

            <p>The search for Kitaev's quantum spin liquid (KQSL) state in real materials has recently expanded with the prediction that honeycomb lattices of divalent, high-spin cobalt ions could host the dominant bond-dependent exchange interactions required to stabilize the elusive entangled quantum state. The layered honeycomb Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ has been singled out as a leading candidate provided that the trigonal crystal field acting on Co $3d$ orbitals, which enhances non-Kitaev exchange interactions between $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ spin-orbital pseudospins, is reduced. We find that applied pressure leads to anisotropic compression of the layered structure, significantly reducing the trigonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra. A strong enhancement of ferromagnetic correlations between pseudospins is observed in the spin-polarized (3 Tesla) phase up to about 60 GPa. Higher pressures drive a spin transition into a low-spin state destroying the $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ local moments required to map the spin Hamiltonian into Kitaev's model. The spin transition strongly suppresses the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and appears to stabilize a paramagnetic phase driven by frustration. Although applied pressure fails to realize a KQSL state, the possible emergence of frustrated magnetism of localized, low-spin $S=\frac{1}{2}$ moments opens the door for exploration of novel magnetic quantum states in compressed honeycomb lattices of divalent cobaltates.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has attracted lots of research interest due to the possible existence of deconfined criticality. In the present work, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$ model using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, where $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_4$ stand for the nearest-neighbor, next nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions respectively. An empty plaquette (EP) phase is found with spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking. However, different from the EP phase in literature, the EP phase in our VMC approach is a $Z_2$ deconfined phase with majorana-type gapless spinons in the excitation spectrum. Additionally, a symmetric gapless $Z_2$ Quantum spin liquid phase is found adjacent to the EP phase, full plaquette (FP) and the Neel antiferromagnetic phases. The phase transition from the QSL phase to these ordered phases are found to be continuous. While the transition to the EP phase is of Landau type, the transitions to the Neel phase and the FP phase can be interpreted as condensation of $Z_2$ gauge charge ($e$ particle) and flux ($m$ particle).</p>

            <p>A large anomalous Nernst effect is essential for thermoelectric energy harvesting in the transverse geometry without external magnetic field. It is often connected with anomalous Hall effect, especially when electronic Berry curvature is believed to be the driving force. This approach implicitly assumes the same symmetry for the Nernst and Hall coefficients, which is however not necessarily true. Here we report a large anomalous Nernst effect in antiferromagnetic SrIr$_{0.8}$Sn$_{0.2}$O$_3$ that defies the antisymmetric constraint on the anomalous Hall effect imposed by the Onsager reciprocal relation. The observed spontaneous Nernst thermopower quickly reaches the sub-$\mu$V/K level below the Néel transition around 250 K, which is comparable with many topological antiferromagnetic semimetals and far excels other magnetic oxides. Our analysis indicates that the coexistence of significant symmetric and antisymmetric contributions plays a key role, pointing to the importance of extracting both contributions and a new pathway to enhanced anomalous Nernst effect for transverse thermoelectrics</p>

            <p>The doping dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_{\text{s}}$ exhibits distinct behaviors in the underdoping and overdoping regimes of the cuprate, while the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_c$ is generally scaled with $\rho_{\text{s}}$. In this paper, we present a unified understanding of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ across the entire doping range by incorporating the underlying mutual Chern-Simons gauge structure that couples the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the doped Mott insulator. Within this framework, the SC phase fluctuations are deeply intertwined with the spin dynamics, such that thermally excited neutral spins determine $T_c$, while quantum spin excitations effectively reduce the superfluid density at zero temperature. As a result, a Uemura-like scaling of $T_c$ vs. $\rho_{\text{s}}$ in the underdoped regime naturally emerges, while the suppression of both $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ at overdoping is attributed to a drastic reduction of antiferromagnetic spin correlations.</p>

            <p>The process of spin-charge interconversion is critical in modern spintronics. Nonetheless, experiments conducted on a wide variety of magnetic heterostructures consistently report that charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies can be vastly different, especially in the case of topological insulators (TI). This discrepancy between the two "reciprocal" effects remains unexplained, hampering the development of spin devices based on spin-charge conversion. In this study, we investigate both spin-charge and charge-spin interconversion processes in TI Bi2Te3/Py and Pt/Py bilayers experimentally using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping techniques. We find that the measured charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (C-S) in TI/Py is ~26 times larger than the measured spin-to-charge conversion efficiency (S-C), whereas C-S and S-C are comparable in the case of Pt/Py. Using a theoretical model enforcing Onsager reciprocity, we show that spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversions in bilayers are genuinely inequivalent, and explain our results as arising from the distinct spin current leakage that takes place during the interconversion. This work clarifies previous conflicting reports on spin-charge interconversion processes and highlights the potential of interface engineering to achieve efficient spin transport in TI-based ferromagnetic heterostructures, paving the way for highly efficient spintronic devices.</p>

We detect that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, reflecting distinct ground states characteristic of Gd-containing compounds. Using negativity as a quantum entanglement measure, we analyze the effects of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite and bipartite entanglements in two families of Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong tetrapartite entanglement, persisting up to $T \approx 2.5$ K and $B \approx 4.0$ T, but considerably weak bipartite entanglement between Ni$\cdots$Ni and Ni$\cdots$Gd links. Conversely, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ shows strong bipartite entanglements but negligible tetrapartite entanglement negativity.

            <p>We study the critical behavior driven by potential quantum critical points (QCPs) termed as $\tau_{0,x,y,z}$-Type QCPs in the $d$-wave cuprate superconductors. Within the framework of the renormalization group approach, we construct the coupled flow equations of all interaction parameters and obtain several unique properties. On one hand, the interaction parameters flow toward several fixed points (FPs) at certain critical energy scales. We identify two different types of FPs designated at the clean limit. FP-I is characterized by the divergence of the quadratic parameter and exhibits robustness against variations in interaction parameters. In contrast, FP-II is dominated by the cubic and quartic interaction parameters, and it is sensitive to initial conditions, leading to five subclasses. Besides, we find that disorder scattering can influence fermion velocities and critical energy scales, and even destabilize certain FPs around the $\tau_{x,z}$-QCPs, driving the system toward a preempted disorder-induced FP. On the other hand, we find that quantum fluctuations play a critical role in shaping the critical temperature ($T_c$) as the system approaches these QCPs. Near the $\tau_x$-QCP, $T_c$ is considerably suppressed for both FP-I and FP-II. In contrast, near the $\tau_0$-QCP, $T_c$ undergoes a substantial decrease for FP-I but only a slight decrease for FP-II. Conversely, $T_c$ exhibits an increasing trend near the $\tau_y$-QCP, with a pronounced peak at $v_{\Delta 0}/v_{F0} \sim 0.25$. However, numerical analysis suggests that the $\tau_z$-QCP is unlikely to be physically realizable. Additionally, we realize that $T_c$ can also be modified by the emergence of disorder-induced FPs in the vicinity of the $\tau_x$-QCP. These findings would provide valuable insights into the critical low-energy properties of $d$-wave cuprate superconductors and related materials.</p>

            <h2>Broken symmetry states and Quantum Hall Ferromagnetism in decoupled twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vineet Pandey, Prasenjit Ghosh, Riju Pal, Sourav Paul, Abhijith M B, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Atindra Nath Pal, Vidya Kochat</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent this http URL N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekulé order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous tendency of high-temperature superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves has reignited interest in the enigmatic nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their complex phase diagrams. While pronounced anomalies in the dispersion of several phonon branches have been reported, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under extreme conditions of low temperature and high magnetic field we uncover a striking renormalization of the phonon spectra in the model cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting two emblematic CDW states: a two-dimensional short-range CDW emerging above the superconducting transition and a three-dimensional long-range CDW that appears only when superconductivity is suppressed by a strong magnetic field or uniaxial compression. The spectral changes are strongest at the wave vector corresponding to the 3D CDW order despite the fact that the CDW is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models and instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive charge-density-wave excitations. These results provide fresh insights into the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

            <p>We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr Povitchan, Denys I. Bondar, Andrii G. Sotnikov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</p>

            <p>As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.</p>

            <h2>ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang</p>
            <p>We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.</p>

            <h2>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao</p>
            <p>U(1) non-linear sigma models (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase are studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations with finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</p>

            <p>Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</p>

By constructing the ground-state phase diagram and analyzing magnetization, we identify key magnetic phases and critical phenomena. We further quantify quantum correlations using tripartite entanglement negativity and conditional von Neumann entropy to unveil how the Jahn-Teller effect enhances intra-triangle entanglement while modulating inter-triangle correlations. Our findings highlight the Fe$^{3+}_6$ complex as a promising molecular platform for tunable quantum correlations, with potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular qubits.</p>

            <p>Recently discovered, altermagnetism represents a third class of collinear magnets. These materials exhibit zero net magnetization, similar to antiferromagnets, but display anomalous transport properties resembling those of ferromagnets. Altermagnetic materials manifest various anomalous electronic transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Nernst effect, and anomalous thermal Hall effect. Additionally, they exhibit magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects, previously considered exclusive to ferromagnetic materials. These anomalous transport phenomena are constrained by symmetry, as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, an effective model-based approach to verify these symmetry constraints remains unavailable. In this Letter, we construct a $k\cdot p$ model for $d$-wave altermagnets CuX$_2$ (X=F,Cl) using spin space group representations and apply it to calculate the anomalous Hall effect. The symmetry-imposed transport properties predicted by the model are in agreement with the DFT results, providing a foundation for further investigation into symmetry-restricted transport phenomena in altermagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.</p>

            <p>Silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising candidates for practical quantum computers because of their scalability and compatibility with the well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, the coherence time is limited in industry-standard natural silicon because of the $^{29}$Si isotopes, which have non-zero nuclear spin. Here, we protect an isotopically natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot spin qubit from environmental noise via electron spin resonance with a phase-modulated microwave (MW) drive. This concatenated continuous drive (CCD) method extends the decay time of Rabi oscillations from 1.2 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ to over 200 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. Furthermore, we define a protected qubit basis and propose robust gate operations. We find the coherence time measured by Ramsey sequence is improved from 143 ns to 40.7 $\mu$s compared to that of the bare spin qubit. The single qubit gate fidelity measured with randomized benchmarking is improved from 95% to 99%, underscoring the effectiveness of the CCD method. The method shows promise for improving control fidelity of noisy qubits, overcoming the qubit variability for global control, and maintaining qubit coherence while idling.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.</p>

            <p>Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.</p>

These defects create well-understood rheological behavior in passive nematics, but the interplay between colloid-associated defects and spontaneously generated activity-induced defects introduces new dynamical regimes in active nematic turbulence. Using mesoscale simulations, we study the motion of colloids with strong anchoring in an active nematic and find effective colloid diffusivity exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on activity. At low activities, topological kicks from the motile activity-induced bulk defects drive frequent rearrangements of the colloid-associated defects, enhancing colloidal transport. At high activity, defect interactions become isotropic, decorrelating colloidal motion and reducing the effective diffusivity. Our results reveal how the competition between colloid-associated and activity-induced defects fundamentally shapes transport in active nematics.</p>

Magnetic measurements show non-zero but small hysteresis indicating CoRuTiSn as a soft ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of ~200 K. The magnetic moment determined from magnetization data is found to be 0.84 {\mu}B/f.u. at 4 K, which is close to the value, calculated using first principles calculations. Electrical resistivity decreases with temperatures, indicating semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn. Hall effect measurements show anomalous behavior, consistent with the ferromagnetic nature of the sample.

            <p>We investigate the sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the first-order perturbation theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p>

            <p>We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</p>

This powerful and versatile time-resolved nonlinear optical spectroscopy technique enables the investigation of individual localized single photon emitters, as well as microscopy of extended samples, e.g., two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Starting with the fundamental theory of optically driven two-level systems, we motivate the utility of wave mixing spectroscopy via a discussion on homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths which can be independently measured using FWM. We then provide a detailed overview of the heterodyne wave mixing setup operated by one of the authors (JK) at Institut Néel in Grenoble, supported by theoretical modeling of the signal detection process. Throughout the paper we elaborate on important benefits of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, e.g., background-free detection, measurement of the full signal field including amplitude and phase, and investigation of coupling mechanisms in few-level systems. Within the context of the latter point we discuss the significance of two-dimensional (2D) FWM spectra. This tutorial is dedicated to students, young researchers, as well as experts in the field of nonlinear spectroscopy in general and FWM in particular. It explains the fundamental concepts and building blocks required to operate a heterodyne wave mixing experiment both from the experimental and theoretical side. This joint approach is helpful for theoreticians who want to accurately and quantitatively model wave mixing signals, as well as for experimentalists who aim to interpret their recorded data.</p>

            <h2>Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Nonconservative Current-Induced Electronic Forces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Mäck, Riley J. Preston, Michael Thoss, Samuel L. Rudge</p>
            <p>Understanding the current-induced vibrational dynamics in molecular nanojunctions is critical for gaining insight into the stability of such systems. While it is well known that Joule heating at higher bias voltages plays an important role for the stability of the nanojunction, a different mechanism caused by current-induced nonconservative forces has been reported to cause vibrational instabilities already at much lower voltages. In this paper, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to a model system for which vibrational instabilities have previously been reported. The electronic friction and other electronic forces can be calculated exactly using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We perform Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics to calculate the steady-state vibrational excitation and compare the results to a simplified eigenmode analysis, identifying the parameter regimes in which runaway modes appear.</p>

            <h2>Single-band Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model with Tunable Anisotropy from Twisted Diamond Homobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Sun, Chuyi Tuo, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>The ground-state properties of the single-band triangular lattice Hubbard model with hopping anisotropy and strong interactions remain elusive so far. Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\leq t'/t\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a Néel antiferromagnetic phase. This work provides a first realization of displacement-field tuned anisotropy in a single-band triangular Hubbard model within moiré systems, establishing them as a promising platform to investigate intriguing correlated physics with tunable anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of distinct exact mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchayan Banerjee, Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Tapan Mishra</p>
            <p>Mobility edges (MEs) constitute the energies separating the localized states from the extended ones in disordered systems. Going beyond this conventional definition, recent proposal suggests for an ME which separates the localized and multifractal states in certain quasiperiodic systems - dubbed as the anomalous mobility edges (AMEs). In this study, we propose an exactly solvable quasiperiodic system that hosts both the conventional and anomalous mobility edges under proper conditions. We show that with increase in quasiperiodic disorder strength, the system first undergoes a delocalization to localization transition through an ME of conventional type. Surprisingly, with further increase in disorder, we obtain that a major fraction of the localized states at the middle of the spectrum turn multifractal in nature. Such unconventional behavior in the spectrum results in two AMEs, which continue to exist even for stronger quasiperiodic disorder. We numerically obtain the signatures of the coexisting MEs complement it through analytical derivation using Avila's global theory. In the end we provide important signatures from the wavepacket dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</h2>

            <p>The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</p>

            <p>Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent--a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents--each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback--our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Fulgado-Claudio, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.</p>

            <h2>Light's symmetry, asymmetry, and their role in nonlinear optics and ultrafast phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ofer Neufeld, Matan Even Tzur, Ofer Kfir, Avner Fleischer, Oren Cohen</p>
            <p>The analysis of symmetries is extremely useful across science. In Physics, symmetries are used to derive conservation laws and selection rules for transitions in interacting systems. In the early days of nonlinear optics (NLO), symmetries were used to formulate a set of rules for photonic processes according to the medium's symmetries that are reflected in the NLO coefficient tensor. While this approach was believed to be complete and closed, the field has recently reignited as multi-color ultrashort laser pulses with tailored polarization and spatiotemporal structures become standard in NLO. A more complete theory has been recently emerging, which aims to incorporate all possible dynamical degrees of freedom of light: spin and orbital angular momentum, spatial structure, time-dependent polarizations, temporal envelopes, etc., in addition to the symmetries of the medium. This theoretical development is also accompanied by experimental advances that rely on tailored light beams that can now be generated with ever-increasing complexity, including topologies in real and a variety of synthetic dimensions, carrying poly-chromatic carrier waves, time-dependent varying angular momenta, local-chirality, and more. The nonlinear interactions between light fields with unique symmetries (or asymmetries) and matter is especially appealing, since that holds the key for developing new ultrafast spectroscopies with sub-femtosecond resolution, for exerting exact control over matter, and improving our fundamental understanding of how light and matter interact. We review these recent advances in this expanding field, focusing on the theory, its implications, and seminal experiments. We aim to establish a comprehensive database of symmetries and selection rules governing NLO light-matter interactions within the emerging new formalism, and invite the scientific community to contribute to this effort.</p>

            <h2>Axisymmetric thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows for microfluidics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weida Liao, Eric Lauga</p>
            <p>Recent microfluidic experiments have explored the precise positioning of micron-sized particles in liquid environments via laser-induced thermoviscous flow. From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile technique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay between thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning of the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of particles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on two-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical model for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport induced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We first numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat source in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the small, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the instantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of passive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the flow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while the leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or sink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole, whose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. Our quantitative results reveal the potential for future three-dimensional net transport and manipulation of particles at the microscale.</p>

            <p>Strong interaction between electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of a high magnetic field gives rise to fractional quantum Hall states that host quasiparticles with fractional charge and fractional exchange statistics. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall states in ultra clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices. Spectroscopy measurements show sharp excitations that have been predicted to emerge when electrons fractionalize into bound states of quasiparticles. We find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian fractional states that are larger by a factor of five than other related systems - for example semiconductor heterostructures - and this suggests bilayer graphene is an ideal platform for the manipulation of these quasiparticles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. We also find previously unobserved fractional states in our very clean graphene samples.</p>

            <p>Using first-principle calculations, we investigate the electronic, topological and superconducting properties of Nb$_3$X (X = Ge, Sn, Sb) and Ta$_3$Y (Y = As, Sb, Bi) A15 compounds. We demonstrate that these compounds host Dirac surface states which are related to a nontrivial Z$_2$ topological value. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splits the eightfold degenerate R point close to the Fermi level enhancing the amplitude of the spin Hall conductance. Indeed, despite the moderate spin-orbit of the Nb-compounds, a large spin Hall effect is also obtained in Nb$_3$Ge and Nb$_3$Sn compounds. We show that the Coulomb interaction opens the gap at the R point thus making more evident the occurrence of Dirac surface states. We then investigate the superconducting properties by determining the strength of the electron-phonon BCS coupling. The evolution of the critical temperature is tracked down to the 2D limit indicating a reduction of the transition temperature which mainly arises from the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. Finally, we propose a minimal tight-binding model based on three coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with t$_{2g}$ Ta- and Nb-orbitals reproducing the spin-orbit splittings at the R point among the $\pi$-bond bands in this class of compounds. We separate the kinetic parameters in $\pi$ and $\delta$-bonds, in intradimer and interdimer hoppings and discuss their relevance for the topological electronic structure. We point out that Nb$_3$Ge might represent a Z$_2$ topological metal with the highest superconducting temperature ever recorded.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced charge and spin Hall currents in materials with $C_4K$ symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tohid Farajollahpour, R. Ganesh, Kirill Samokhin</p>
            <p>Berry curvature, a momentum space property, can manifest itself in current responses. The well-known anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal-breaking systems arises from a Berry curvature monopole. In time-reversal-invariant materials, a second-order Hall conductivity emerges from a Berry curvature dipole. Recently, it has been shown that a Berry curvature quadrupole induces a third-order ac Hall response in systems that break time reversal ($K$) and a fourfold rotational ($C_{4}$) symmetry, while remaining invariant under the combination of the two ($C_{4}K$). In this letter, we demonstrate that incident light can induce a $\rm dc$ Hall current in such systems, driven by the Berry curvature quadrupole. We consider a combination of a static $\rm dc$ electric field and an ac light-induced electric field. We calculate the current perpendicular to both the static electric field and the fourfold axis. Remarkably, the induced current is generically spin-polarized. A net charge current appears for light that is linearly or elliptically polarized, but not for circular polarization. In contrast, the spin current remains unchanged when the polarization of light is varied. This allows for rich possibilities such as generating a spin current by shining circularly polarized light on an altermagnetic material. We demonstrate this physics using a two-dimensional toy model for altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric-induced Oscillations in Flat Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Zeng, Zijian Zhou, Wenhui Duan, Huaqing Huang</p>
            <p>The transport of Bloch electrons under strong fields is traditionally understood through two mechanisms: intraband Bloch oscillations and interband Zener tunneling. Here, we propose an oscillation mechanism induced by the interband quantum metric, which would significantly affect the electron dynamics under strong fields. By considering the multiband dynamics to the second order of the density matrix, we reveal that quantum metric induced oscillations (QMOs) persist regardless of band dispersion, even in exactly dispersionless flat bands. The resultant drift current can reach a magnitude comparable to the Bloch oscillation induced drift current in systems where interband tunneling is negligible. Notably, the QMO induced drift current increases linearly with electric field strength under the constraints of time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetry, emerging as the primary delocalized current. We further show that both one-dimensional and two-dimensional superlattices are potential platforms for investigating QMO.</p>

            <p>We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</p>

            <p>We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.</p>

            <p>The collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or, at equilibrium, on Fourier-based approaches which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we investigate the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically. We use a "Countoscope" technique, which analyses the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of a series of microscopy images at equilibrium, to measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$ for the first time. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. We show that Fourier techniques yield inaccurate long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting exploits this property by using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.</p>

We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</p>

            <p>Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it remains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific applications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict and hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural model for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the specific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in the initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The mechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic model for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing the model predictions to data from unconfined compression experiments, we show that the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent creep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of materials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial fluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using stiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's modulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, a high-level and open-source Python package has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments using the model.</p>

            <p>Superconductors are characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and have enabled cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies. Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, non-equilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips -- discrete $2\pi$ jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter -- in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.</p>

Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</p>

            <p>Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Fritzsch, Maximilian F. I. Kieler, Arnd Bäcker</p>
            <p>While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</p>

            <h2>First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Víctor Herráiz-López, Sebastián Roca-Jerat, Manuel Gallego, Ramón Ferrández, Jesús Carrete, David Zueco, Juan Román-Roche</p>
            <p>We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyuan Chen, Yuanjie Ren, Ruihua Fan, Arthur Jaffe</p>
            <p>One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can rigorously determine these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, highlighting a novel generalized mechanism discovered in this experiment and shown with rigorous theory. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</p>

            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</p>

            <h2>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz</p>
            <p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p>

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant</p>
            <p>We show that resonant driving between the spin up and spin down states of an electron spin-qubit in a quantum dot reduces the occupancy of the dot through leakage to an appropriately tuned lead. A nearby charge sensor measuring the occupancy of the dot should be able to detect the narrow resonant condition upon sweeping the driving frequency. The presence of interactions with noisy and thermal environments such as leads are an inherent part of creating and manipulating quantum information processing systems. This work is an example of how to incorporate methods from the ``open quantum systems'' perspective into descriptions of quantum devices. The method used here captures the coherent dynamics of the Rabi driving on the spin state of an electron tunneling into a lead, and yields full equations of motion for the interaction-picture density matrix with on- or off-resonance driving</p>

            <p>As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.</p>

            <h2>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff</p>
            <p>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces $\ca H_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.</p>

Séamus Davis, Qiangqiang Gu</p>
            <p>Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</p>

            <p>We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$.

We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p>

            <p>Due to the dominant Kitaev exchange interactions, the cobaltate, Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$, has been considered to be approximate to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here, we investigate both magnetic dilution and chemical pressure effects of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ by the substitutions of Mg$^{2+}$ for Co$^{2+}$ through the structural, optical, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements. No structural transition has been observed, and the bandgaps remain constant in all doping levels. Combining with the magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, we find that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed with increasing Mg doping levels and completely disappears at $x=0.2$. Interestingly, when the doping level $x$ is larger than 0.2, neither long-range magnetic order nor spin glass state has been detected, and the specific heat has a residual linear term at zero field. All features indicate that Na$_{3}$(Co$_{2-x}$Mg$_{x}$)SbO$_{6}$ system enters into a novel spin disorder (NSD) state.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small c-axis parameter of 3.26 Å and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. We observe distinct magnetotransport behaviors in europium-containing samples, including negative magnetoresistance and field-enhanced superconductivity. By establishing a clear correlation between decreasing c-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems, these findings establish clear materials design principles for achieving higher transition temperatures in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Animesh Hazra, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan</p>
            <p>We show that lattice models in $d>1$ dimensions with mass-conserving and multidirectional hopping dynamics exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values, even {\it far} from phase transition point (if any). The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems are described by continuous-time Markov jump processes, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, in dimensions $d > 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlations in the thermodynamic limit decay {\it universally} as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the bulk-diffusion coefficient and mobility tensor. In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, should result in generic long-ranged correlations in the systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-geun Oh, Sun-Woo Kim, Kun Woo Kim, Bartomeu Monserrat, Jun-Won Rhim</p>
            <p>Exploring the quantum geometric properties of solids beyond their topological aspects has become a key focus in current solid-state physics research. We derive the geometric formula for optical conductivity from the quantum metric tensor, applicable to the low-energy regime. This general formulation also depends on the detailed shape of the band dispersion in addition to the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function. We demonstrate, however, that for quadratic band-touching (QBT) semimetals, the optical conductivity simplifies to $\sigma = (e^2/8\hbar)d^2_\mathrm{max}$ when the light frequency exceeds a critical threshold, where $d_\mathrm{max}$ represents the maximum Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance around the band-crossing point. This result indicates that the optical conductivity of QBT semimetals is universal and determined entirely by quantum geometry, independent of other details of the band structure. Furthermore, under time-reversal and rotational symmetries, $d_\mathrm{max}$ is restricted to discrete values of 0 or 1, leading to a quantized universal optical conductivity. Through first-principles calculations, we show that our findings are applicable to real materials, including bilayer graphene, Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$, and other realistic material candidates. Our work underscores the critical role of quantum geometry in governing optical properties, which can be probed through standard optical methods.</p>

            <h2>Discrete spectrum of edge states in a two-dimensional topological insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. I. Milstein, I. S. Terekhov</p>
            <p>The interaction model of two electrons in the edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator is investigated. Both solutions of the Schrödinger equation and solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation at different values of the Fermi energy are considered. It is shown that for the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which takes into account the existence of the Fermi surface, there is a discrete spectrum in the system of two electrons. This phenomenon does not appear in the case of the Schrödinger equation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometry and Many-Body Landau-Zener Tunneling in Time-dependent Quantum Systems with Instantaneous Quantum Integrability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>We study quantum geometric effects in time-dependent quantum many-body systems quenched from integrable systems through a unitary transformation whose phase operator is linear in time. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Finite-Temperature Behavior of Rydberg Atom Arrays: A Tensor Network Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhou Han, Hao Zhang, Lixin He</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for experimental research and a challenging subject for theoretical investigation in quantum science. In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of two-dimensional square-lattice Rydberg atom arrays using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) method. By analyzing the thermal behavior of systems in the checkerboard and striated phases, we extract critical exponents and identify phase transition characteristics. Our results confirm that the checkerboard phase transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class, while the striated phase exhibits critical exponents that deviate from known universality classes, possibly due to finite-size effects. These findings provide theoretical insights into the thermal stability of quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays and offer valuable guidance for future experimental efforts.</p>

            <h2>Emergent ferromagnetic ladder excitations in heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_{2}$</h2>

            <p>Low-dimensional spin fluctuations play a crucial role in unconventional superconductors, with quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations potentially linked with spin-triplet superconductivity. The heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_2$ exhibits an unusual large inverted S-shaped upper critical field that suggests a possible triplet pairing state within its pressure-induced superconducting dome. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb$_2$ emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the "rungs" of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above $T_{\rm N}$, suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Insights into the Crystallization of 4'-Hydroxyacetophenone from Water: Solute Aggregation, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Polymorph Selection</h2>

            <p>In this work insights into the structural rearrangements occurring in aqueous solution, prior to the nucleation of different 4'-hydroxyacetophenone (HAP) forms from water were obtained, through a combination of thermomicroscopy, micro-differential scanning calorimetry, density and speed of sound measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results confirmed our previous observation that cooling crystallization of HAP is intermediated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and, depending on the initially selected concentration range, selectively leads to the formation of different crystal forms. Analysis of the solution properties before the onset of LLPS revealed that, in the HAP mole fraction range xHAP \< 0.004 (Zone I), where hydrate H2 ultimately crystallizes, small, solvated clusters are initially present in solution, which remain approximately invariant in size, shape and HAP/H2O proportion as the temperature decreases. For the xHAP \&gt; 0.005 range (Zone III), where anhydrous form I crystallizes, large HAP/water aggregates (that can even percolate the whole system as xHAP approaches the 0.005 limit) are already initially present in solution. As cooling progresses, they become more compact, a process accompanied by a reduction in water content, and which is more significant as the solution concentration increases. The 0.004 \< xHAP \< 0.005 (Zone II) range corresponds to a transition region where, as xHAP increases, the physical properties of the solution initially evolve from those typical of Zone I and, at a certain point, abruptly change and start converging to those typical of Zone III. In all zones, the colloidal particles formed upon LLPS (from which crystallization results) can also reduce their water content on cooling, but the extent of this process increases as xHAP moves from Zones I and II, where hydrates are formed, to Zone III, where anhydrous Form I is produced.</p>

            <p>The two-dimensional triangular lattice (TAL) is a model system of magnetic frustration and competing interactions, where skyrmion spin vortices can be induced by a vertical magnetic field $B$. We target the binary compound GdGa$_2$ with an undistorted TAL of Gd$^{3+}$ Heisenberg moments. At higher temperature ($T > 5$ K, $B = 0$, phase II), we reveal the cycloidal spin textures in GdGa$_2$ via resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). Further, a transition with strong magneto-elastic response occurs when cooling into the zero-field ground state ($T < 5$ K, phase I). We also report the thermodynamic phase boundaries of $B$-induced magnetic A-phases, which are suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and which have enhanced resistivity due to the partial opening of a charge gap. In analogy to Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, these phases may represent a superposition of various cycloids, possibly a Néel skyrmion lattice. Our work lays the basis for further studies of the magnetic phase diagram of GdGa$_2$.</p>

            <p>Radiation-induced crystal lattice damage and its recovery in wide bandgap oxides, in particular beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3), is a complex process. This paper presents the first study on the process of the defects accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 implanted with Rare Earth (RE) ions and the impact of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) on the defects formed. (-201) oriented beta-Ga2O3 single crystals were implanted with Yb ions fluences ranging from 1 x 1012 to 5 x 1015 at/cm2. Channeling Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS/c) was used to study the crystal lattice damage induced by ion implantation and the level of structure recovery after annealing. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of collected spectra were performed by computer simulations. The resulting accumulation curve reveals a two-step damage process. In the first stage, the damage of the beta-Ga2O3 is inconspicuous, but begins to grow rapidly from the fluence of 1 x 1013 at/cm2, reaching the saturation at the random level for the Yb ion fluence of 1 x 1014 at/cm2. Further irradiation causes the damage peak to become bimodal, indicating that at least two new defect forms develop for the higher ion fluence. These two damage zones differently react to annealing, suggesting that they could origin from two phases, the amorphization phase and the new crystalline phase of Ga2O3.</p>

            <p>New mechanochemical preparations of three multicomponent crystals (MCCs) of the form MCl:urea.nH2O (M = Li+, Na+, and Cs+) are reported. Their structures were determined by an NMR crystallography approach, combining Rietveld refinement of synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD), multinuclear (35Cl, 7Li, 23Na, and 133Cs) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. Mechanochemical syntheses of the three MCCs, two of which are novel, are optimized for maximum yield and efficiency. 35Cl SSNMR is well-suited for the structural characterization of these MCCs since it is sensitive to subtle differences and/or changes in chloride ion environments, providing a powerful means of examining H...Cl-bonding environments. Alkali metal NMR is beneficial for identifying the number of unique magnetically and crystallographically distinct sites and enables facile detection of educts and/or impurities. In the case of NaCl:urea.H2O, 23Na MAS NMR spectra are key, both for identifying residual NaCl educt and for monitoring NaCl:urea.H2O degradation, which appears to proceed via an autocatalytic decomposition process driven by water (with a rate constant of k = 1.22x10-3 s-1). SSNMR and PXRD were used to inform the initial structural models. Following Rietveld refinement, the models were subjected to dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT geometry optimizations and subsequent calculations of the 35Cl EFG tensors, which enable the refinement of hydrogen atom positions, as well as the exploration of their relationships to the local hydrogen bonding environments of the chloride ions and crystallographic symmetry elements.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Towards this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients - self diffusion coefficient $D$ and viscosity $\eta$, (ii) relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ as well as (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ over a broad range of temperature $T$, pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak break down in SE relation involving $D$ and $\eta$, and the loci of \Revision{the breakdown of the SE relation} (SEB) is found in the high T liquid phase. The $\tau_{\alpha}$, when used as a proxy to $\eta$, shows distinct breakdown in the SE relation whose loci is found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram shows that loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behaviour. Computation of $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behaviour using which we show that the \Revision{breakdown of the SE relation} occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Further we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behaviour, including the loci of compressiblity maximum, density maximum as well as diffusivity maximum.</p>

            <p>Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Within this spectrum, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons because transitions to the ground state are forbidden by selection rules. This makes their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state, which is used here to reveal its dynamics following a sudden photoinjection of free carriers in the conduction band. We observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sakineh Mizani, Martin Oettel, Péter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga</p>
            <p>We study the orientational ordering and close packing behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) hard superellipse system in which centers of particles are restricted to a line while they can rotate freely in a two-dimensional plane. Through the aspect ratio (k), the elongation of the particles and through the deformation parameter (n), the shape can be tuned between ellipses and rectangles. Maxima in the pressure ratio (P/Phd) (where P and Phd are the pressure of hard superellipses and that of q1D hard disks) are a good indicator for the continuous structural change from isotropic to nematic order. This change occurs at higher densities than the sharp nematic transitions of corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional hard body systems. Additionally, suitable close packing exponents describing the close-packing limit show universality in that they depending only on n and certain combinations are independent of both k and n.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical instabilities of an ultracold Bose-Bose mixture with long-range dipole-dipole interactions, trapped in deep optical lattices and subject to periodically varying contact interaction. The effect of beyond-mean-field corrections due to quantum fluctuations is considered. In the tight-binding regime, we employ Wannier functions to derive a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures the dynamics of the system. Using linear stability analysis coupled to multiple scale expansion, we systematically study the modulational and parametric instabilities of the system, identifying the conditions under which these instabilities emerge. The corresponding instability domains are found and examined. The roles of long-range interactions and quantum fluctuations are highlighted, demonstrating their significant impact on the stability and dynamics of the lattice system. Our analytical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations, which confirm the instability diagrams through the effective onset of instabilities and reveal the intricate interplay between interaction strength, quantum fluctuation, and the long-range nature of the dipole-dipole forces. This work provides insights into the control and manipulation of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices, which have potential applications in quantum simulation and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Linear statistics at the microscopic scale for the 2D Coulomb gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Le Doussal, Gregory Schehr</p>
            <p>We consider the classical Coulomb gas in two dimensions at the inverse temperature $\beta=2$, confined within a droplet of radius $R$ by a rotationally invariant potential $U(r)$. For $U(r)\sim r^2$ this describes the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble of random matrices. We study linear statistics of the form ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(|{\bf x}_i|)$, where ${\bf x}_i$'s are the positions of the $N$ particles, in the large $N$ limit with $R=O(1)$. It is known that for smooth functions $f(r)$ the variance ${\rm Var} \,{\cal L}_N= O(1)$, while for an indicator function relevant for the disk counting statistics, all cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 2$ behave as $\sim \sqrt{N}$. In addition, for smooth functions, it was shown that the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 3$ scale as $\sim N^{2-q}$. Surprisingly it was found that they depend only on $f'(|\bf x|)$ and its derivatives evaluated exactly at the boundary of the droplet. To understand this property, and interpolate between the two behaviors (smooth versus step-like), we study the microscopic linear statistics given by $f(r) \to f_N(r) = \phi((r-\hat r) \sqrt{N}/\xi)$, which probes the fluctuations at the scale of the inter-particle distance. We compute the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ at large $N$ for a fixed $\phi(u)$ at arbitrary $\xi$. For large $\xi$ they match the predictions for smooth functions which shows that the leading contribution in that case comes from a boundary layer of size $1/\sqrt{N}$ near the boundary of the droplet. Finally we show that the full probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$ take two distinct large deviation forms, in the regime ${\cal L}_N \sim \sqrt{N}$ and ${\cal L}_N \sim N$ respectively. We also discuss applications of our results to fermions in a rotating harmonic trap and to the Ginibre symplectic ensemble.</p>

            <p>A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.</p>

            <p>Skyrmion formation in centrosymmetric magnets without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions was originally predicted from unbiased numerical techniques. However, no attempt has yet been made, by comparison to a real material, to determine the salient interaction terms and model parameters driving spin-vortex formation. We identify a Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange couplings, local ion anisotropy, and four-spin interactions, which is generally applicable to this class of compounds. In the representative system Gd3Ru4Al12, anisotropic exchange drives a fragile balance between helical, skyrmion lattice, and transverse conical (cycloidal) orders. The model is severely constrained by the experimentally observed collapse of the SkL with a small in-plane magnetic field. For the zero-field helical state, we further anticipate that spins can be easily rotated out of the spiral plane by a tilted magnetic field or applied current.</p>

            <h2>Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Gebhard, Kevin Bauerbach, Örs Legeza</p>
            <p>We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</p>

Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Fe5GeTe2, offer a promising platform for spintronic devices based on chiral magnetic textures, provided a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be induced to stabilise them. Here, we directly measure DMI in epitaxial Fe5GeTe2 thin films using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and observe a consistent DMI (D = 0.04 mJ/m2) across various thicknesses. Its weak thickness dependence, combined with the nominally symmetric film interfaces, suggests a bulk origin. Although we do not determine the microscopic mechanism, our findings are compatible with ab-initio calculations linking DMI to partial ordering of Fe split sites. Additionally, we find a low magnetic dissipation (alpha < 0.003).

            <h2>Random quantum Ising model with three-spin couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ferenc Iglói, Yu-Cheng Lin</p>
            <p>We apply a real-space block renormalization group approach to study the critical properties of the random transverse-field Ising spin chain with multispin interactions. First we recover the known properties of the traditional model with two-spin interactions by applying the renormalization approach for arbitrary size of the block. For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.</p>

            <p>We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.</p>

            <h2>Accurate Formula for the Effective Conductivity of Highly Clustered Two-Phase Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murray Skolnick, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Two-phase heterogeneous materials arising in a variety of natural and synthetic situations exhibit a wide-variety of microstructures and thus display a broad-spectrum effective physical properties. Given that such properties of disordered materials generally depend on an infinite-set of microstructural correlation functions that are typically unobtainable, in practice, one must consider rigorous bounds and approximations on the effective properties that depend on a limited set of nontrivial microstructural information. Torquato derived [Random Heterogeneous Materials, Microstructure and Macroscopic Properties (2002)] such an approximation for the effective thermal/electrical conductivity of two-phase microstructures that perturb about those that realize the well-known self-consistent formula; a key feature of such microstructures being phase-inversion symmetry which can be observed in certain cellular, bicontinuous, and porous materials. Here, we show via extensive numerical simulations that this virtually unexamined approximation, which depends on up to three-point correlations, predicts accurately the effective conductivities of various two- and three-dimensional two-phase microstructures across phase volume fractions in which both phases can form large and well-connected clusters; including certain phase-inversion symmetric microstructures as well as phase-inversion asymmetric dispersions of certain fully penetrable particles. We also highlight the accurate sensitivity of this approximation to phase-connectedness properties by showing that it predicts percolation thresholds that are in good quantitative and/or qualitative agreement with known thresholds for the models considered here. Finally, we discuss how this formula can be used to design materials with desirable effective conductivity properties and thus aid in materials by design.</p>

            <h2>Large deformation and collapse analysis of re-entrant auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb lattice structures subjected to tension and compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sima Farshbaf, Narges Dialami, Miguel Cervera</p>
            <p>Additively manufactured auxetic structures offer desirable qualities like lightweight, good energy absorption, excellent indentation resistance, high shear stiffness and fracture toughness among others. A wide range of materials from polymers to metals can be used to fabricate these structures. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Hence, unique mechanical properties can be achieved by specific design. In this work, two types of structures, namely re-entrant auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb, are investigated. Large deformation analyses in both 2D plane strain and 3D are conducted using linear triangular and tetrahedral multi-field displacement-pressure elements. Hyperelastic with rate-independent plasticity constitutive models are utilized and calibrated with experimental uni-axial tensile test results. The structures are subjected to compression and tension at both transversal and longitudinal directions. The contact domain method is employed to capture both self-contact and the interaction between the structure and loading plates. The obtained results show consistency with the experimental data. The outcomes of the analyses regarding the re-entrant auxetic structure agree with the expected behavior, showing a negative value of Poisson's ratio and greater efficiency of energy absorption than the hexagonal honeycomb. By understanding the influence of the loading direction on the structural behavior, equivalent Poisson's ratio and energy absorption a reliable theoretical framework for prospective designs of the lattice materials can be established.</p>

            <h2>Capillary force-driven particle orientation in rod networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lingyue Liu, Sebastian Gassenmeier, Erin Koos</p>
            <p>Capillary suspensions containing anisotropic rod particles exhibit complex microstructural behaviors. Our study investigates the orientation, network formation, and rheological properties of glass microrods in capillary suspensions with varying secondary liquid volumes. Using confocal microscopy, rheometry, and rheoconfocal techniques, we reveal how capillary forces affect particle alignment and movement, and consequently, the microstructure of the samples. As the volume fraction of the secondary liquid increases, the structure of the rod network exhibits a transition from point-to-point contact to side-to-side aligned clusters. This structural change leads to pronounced changes in coordination number, clustering coefficient, and particle orientation distribution. In contrast to spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreases with increasing coordination number, denoting the formation of particle clusters with complex configurations instead of solely side-to-side alignment. Rheological measurements demonstrate the sensitivity of rod-based networks to deformation, with shorter linear viscoelastic regions compared to spherical particle systems. The research provides insights into designing advanced materials with tunable mechanical properties through controlled particle interactions.</p>

            <h2>Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Bernard, Tony Jin, Stefano Scopa, Shiyi Wei</p>
            <p>We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Lateral force microscopy calibration using an interferometric atomic force microscope</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Lefever, Aleksander Labuda, Roger Proksch</p>
            <p>A new method is introduced for calibrating lateral force as measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM), making use of both an interferometric detector and an optical beam detector on the same instrument. The method may be implemented automatically and performed with minimal user input. The microscope has the capability to measure the probe tip height in situ, which allows for a complete lateral force calibration without changing the sample or probe. Two options for lateral force measurements are described wherein the two detectors are alternately used to measure normal and lateral forces, and methods for applying the calibration protocol for both alternatives are provided. The tip height measurement is validated by direct comparison with an electron micrograph and they are generally in agreement to within 1.4 microns. For most cantilevers tested, the complete lateral calibration method is consistent with the wedge calibration method to within the intrinsic uncertainty of the wedge method.</p>

            <h2>A geometrically inspired constitutive framework for damage and intrinsic self-healing of elastomers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanhita Das, Nivedita Kumari</p>
            <p>Autonomic interfacial self-healing in elastomers enables their reprocessing and recycling, making them valuable for applications such as ballistic resistance, surface coatings, adhesives, and biomedical materials. This article prescribes a geometry-based damage-healing theory for autonomic healing in elastomers, built on a framework where damage induces an incompatibility in the Euclidean material manifold, transforming it into a Riemannian manifold. Healing restores the Euclidean state through a reversing damage variable or an evolving healing variable. The reversing damage variable models the rebonding mechanism while the healing variable accounts for healing by chain diffusion and entanglement. The model also predicts healing where rebonding is preceded by chain diffusion. The microforce balance governs the evolution of the damage and healing variables, capturing rate-dependent damage and intrinsic temperature-independent healing. The model is validated through numerical simulations, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations, demonstrating accurate predictions of coupling between damage and healing and post-healing mechanical response. The model also predicts the recovery of fracture toughness with healing time in supramolecular elastomers, aligning with experimental data. With minimal parameters, the model is versatile and can easily be used for material design and structural analysis, surpassing existing models in simplicity and predictive capability.</p>

            <p>Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between its supracellular structure and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cellular pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a method to quantify their rheology using only image data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.</p>

            <p>Recent works have pointed out some worrisome inconsistencies in linear-response calculations performed with nonlocal pseudopotentials. Here we show that most of these issues are fixed by correctly adapting the pseudopotential to the motion of the corresponding nucleus, with a velocity dependence of the nonlocal operator. This prescription restores the correct Galilean covariance of the Schrödinger equation, and the expected identity between mechanical rototranslations and electromagnetic perturbations. We demonstrate our arguments by relating the interatomic force constants to the electromagnetic susceptibility of the system via a set of exact sum rules. Among other virtues, these results conclusively reconcile the inertial and electrical definitions of the Drude weight in metals.</p>

            <p>Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has sparked significant interest in understanding their pairing mechanism and correlated states. While previous theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has been neglected, leaving its effect unexplored and elusive. In this work, we comprehensively explore the effect of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion on both superconductivity and density-wave orders in the presence of onsite interactions by performing functional renormalization group calculations. We find that interlayer repulsion suppresses the interlayer intra-orbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave order, while driving a transition to an interlayer inter-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing and a mirror-symmetry breaking charge order. This transition occurs across a wide range of charge doping and is independent of the presence of the $\gamma$ pocket around M point. Remarkably, the critical scale of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, suggesting that the former pairing is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Additionally, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion promotes an in-plane charge density wave order with a vector of $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings highlight profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and the robustness of interlayer pairing associated with the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, advancing the understanding of the complex correlation effects within bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Chandra</p>
            <p>This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.</p>

            <p>Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.</p>

For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed.

Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures.

            <h2>Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teodor Iličin, Rok Žitko</p>
            <p>We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U<2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U>2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS component is admixed.</p>

            <p>The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$.

            <h2>Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via Krylov spread complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.Medina-Guerra, I.V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the PT-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>In-plane magnetic field-induced orbital FFLO superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moiré mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p>

            <h2>Path integral calculation for emergence of rapid evolution from demographic stochasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yan Shih, Nigel Goldenfeld</p>
            <p>Genetic variation in a population can sometimes arise so fast as to modify ecosystem dynamics. Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey systems, and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase relationships in population dynamics, including a $\pi$ phase shift between predator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations compared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic individual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a subpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation formalism, and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a system-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can emerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations and clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.</p>

            <p>The demand for computing power has been growing exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This growth requires unconventional computing primitives that prioritize energy efficiency, while also addressing the critical need for scalability. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological brain, offers a transformative paradigm for addressing these challenges. This review paper provides an overview of advancements in 2D spintronics and device architectures designed for neuromorphic applications, with a focus on techniques such as spin-orbit torque, magnetic tunnel junctions, and skyrmions. Emerging van der Waals materials like CrI3, Fe3GaTe2, and graphene-based heterostructures have demonstrated unparalleled potential for integrating memory and logic at the atomic scale. This work highlights technologies with ultra-low energy consumption (0.14 fJ/operation), high switching speeds (sub-nanosecond), and scalability to sub-20 nm footprints. It covers key material innovations and the role of spintronic effects in enabling compact, energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, providing a foundation for advancing scalable, next-generation computing architectures.</p>

            <p>The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raju Kumar Yadav, Prince Philip, Boddepalli SanthiBhushan</p>
            <p>While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.</p>

            <h2>An atomistic approach for modeling of polarizability and Raman scattering of water clusters and liquid water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atanu Paul, Ilya Grinberg</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a framework for atomistic modeling of electronic polarizability to predict the Raman spectra of hydrogen-bonded clusters and liquids from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total polarizability of the system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and intermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM), inspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the electronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic polarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of rapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to calculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters ((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are compared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and to experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and physically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters, performs well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong anharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its applicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a hierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated and accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects can be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of clusters, liquids and solids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Hosseinabadi, Oksana Chelpanova, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA outperforms the method of cumulant expansion in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and broad applicability. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Kibe, Pratik Roy</p>
            <p>The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</p>

            <h2>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz</p>
            <p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p>

            <h2>Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Global Charge Redistribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moin Uddin Maruf, Sungmin Kim, Zeeshan Ahmad</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to quantum mechanical simulations for predicting material properties. Message-passing graph neural networks, commonly used in these MLIPs, rely on local descriptor-based symmetry functions to model atomic interactions. However, such local descriptor-based approaches struggle with systems exhibiting long-range interactions, charge transfer, and compositional heterogeneity. In this work, we develop a new equivariant MLIP incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom, specifically global charge distribution within the system. This is achieved using a charge equilibration scheme based on predicted atomic electronegativities. We systematically evaluate our model across a range of benchmark periodic and non-periodic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both short-range equivariant and long-range invariant MLIPs in energy and force predictions. Our approach enables more accurate and efficient simulations of systems with long-range interactions and charge heterogeneity, expanding the applicability of MLIPs in computational materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srijan Kumar</p>
            <p>We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</p>

            <p>In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.</p>

            <p>We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the asymmetric parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form $$\begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*}$$ and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with strong Szegő limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</p>

Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV.</p>

We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</p>

We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</p>

            <p>Learning to remember over long timescales is fundamentally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While much prior work has explored why RNNs struggle to learn long timescales and how to mitigate this, we still lack a clear understanding of the dynamics involved when RNNs learn long timescales via gradient descent. Here we build a mathematical theory of the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained to integrate white noise. We show that when the initial recurrent weights are small, the dynamics of learning are described by a low-dimensional system that tracks a single outlier eigenvalue of the recurrent weights. This reveals the precise manner in which the long timescale associated with white noise integration is learned. We extend our analyses to RNNs learning a damped oscillatory filter, and find rich dynamical equations for the evolution of a conjugate pair of outlier eigenvalues. Taken together, our analyses build a rich mathematical framework for studying dynamical learning problems salient for both machine learning and neuroscience.</p>

Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers.

            <p>We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,1)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</p>

            <h2>Self-Organizing Graph Reasoning Evolves into a Critical State for Continuous Discovery Through Structural-Semantic Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus J. Buehler</p>
            <p>We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.</p>

            <p>Spin ice compounds enable the exploration of the dynamics of magnetic monopoles in condensed matter systems. In this study, we use ac calorimetry to probe the dynamical response of the heat capacity of the classical spin-ice compounds Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures (0.5-5 K). Using frequencies of 0.01-500 Hz, we find a strong frequency dependence in the measured heat capacity and are able to study thermal relaxation effects on the corresponding timescales. The relaxation time $\tau$ is determined from the frequency dependence of the heat capacity as the characteristic frequency below which the heat capacity saturates. The extracted $\tau$ shows a divergent behavior below 1 K reaching $\sim$6 s at 0.65 K, similar to the relaxation time seen in previous studies. Corresponding specific heat shows a maximum around this temperature. Performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we verify that the specific heat frequency response has its origin in the slow magnetic monopole dynamics indigenous to spin ice. We find a timescale of 20 ms per Monte Carlo step at 4 K in contrast to 2.5 ms mentioned in previous studies by other techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taken place in intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we unravel that both the ground and excited-state quantum phase transitions in spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond standard quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides new perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum enhanced sensing.</p>

            <h2>Exact Spectral Function of One-Dimensional Bose Gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song Cheng, Yang-Yang Chen, Xi-Wen Guan, Wen-Li Yang, Rubem Mondaini, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>Exactly solved models provide rigorous understanding of many-body phenomena in strongly correlated systems. In this article, we report a breakthrough in uncovering universal many-body correlated properties of quantum integrable Lieb-Liniger model. We calculate exactly the dynamical correlation functions by computing the form factor through a newly developed method, by which we are capable of calculating all possible "relative excitations" over the ground state or a finite temperature state at a high precision. Consequently, full spectral functions obtained for the model manifests the unique power-law singularity behaviour at the spectral threshold, confirming the validity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. Our method advances the theory of dynamical correlation functions with high precision towards the thermodynamic limit, and is capable of benchmarking experimental observation of such novel correlated properties.</p>

            <h2>Spin-resolved electronic structure of ferromagnetic triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prosper Ngabonziza, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Alexei V. Fedorov, Gang Cao, J. W. Allen, G. Gebreyesus, Richard M. Martin</p>
            <p>High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.</p>

            <h2>Unusually Strong Four-Phonon Scattering Effects on Low-Temperature Thermal Conductivity in Two-Dimensional Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. F. Feng, B. Liu, Xin-Gao Gong, Zhi-Xin Guo</p>
            <p>First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from perturbation theory have achieved significant success. Usually, it only included three-phonon (3ph) scattering processes, only recently four-phonon (4ph) scattering processes were found to have a comparable impact as 3ph scattering at medium and high temperatures in various materials. While the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low temperatures was generally believed to be insignificant. By combining the first-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we find that there are unusually strong 4ph processes even in the low-frequency range of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as h-XN (X = B, Al, Ga), which have a remarkable influence on the low-temperature TC. Such strong 4ph processes originated from the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of 4ph scattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the dispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain engineering. The present study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon transport and its manipulation in 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Respective Roles of Electron-Phonon and Electron-Electron Interactions in the Transport and Quasiparticle Properties of SrVO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David J. Abramovitch, Jernej Mravlje, Jin-Jian Zhou, Antoine Georges, Marco Bernardi</p>
            <p>The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range above 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</p>

            <h2>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuyuki Okuma</p>
            <p>In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <h2>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Vivek, Debabrata Mondal, Subhadeep Chakraborty, S. Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koichi Mayumi, Tatsuro Oda, Shinya Miyajima, Ippei Obayashi, Kazuaki Tanaka</p>
            <p>Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to (i) computational data of a core-shell sphere and experimental CV-SANS data of (ii) clay/polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous solutions and (iii) polyrotaxane solutions, and have successfully estimated the errors of \(S\). The quantitative error estimation of \(S\) offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.</p>

            <h2>A General Approach for Determining Applicability Domain of Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lane E. Schultz, Yiqi Wang, Ryan Jacobs, Dane Morgan</p>
            <p>Knowledge of the domain of applicability of a machine learning model is essential to ensuring accurate and reliable model predictions. In this work, we develop a new and general approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful domain designation across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between data in feature space using kernel density estimation, where this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Illien, Antoine Carof, Benjamin Rotenberg</p>
            <p>In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Patrón, C. A. Plata, A. Prados</p>
            <p>We study the problem of minimising the connection time between non-equilibrium steady states of the Brownian Gyrator. This is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle trapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the control set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$ characterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal minimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols, for which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed, and (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate the minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having infinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge: sets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the connection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from a state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible to reach in a finite time.</p>

            <h2>Partial presentence of memory in bubble breakup: incomplete universality acquired by broken symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ikumi Yoshino, Ko Okumura</p>
            <p>When a water drop falls from a faucet, the drop is created with the formation of an axisymmetric constriction region, which thins down to breakup. Near the singularity of the breakup the physics at small scales becomes important, which could lead to universal dynamics independent of the scales setting the initial boundary conditions, as if memories were lost. This is true in the drop breakup surrounded by air or less viscous fluid, but not in the bubble breakup surrounded by more viscous fluid, under no geometrical confinement. Recently, it has been reported that the axisymmetry at the constriction region can be broken when a system of bubble breakup is confined. Here, we focus on the confined and non-axisymmetric breakup and find its dynamics self-similar: shapes of the liquid-air interface at different times collapsing onto a master curve. Unexpectedly, the master curve depends on the smallest among the length scales setting the initial boundary conditions but not on the other scales: The system retains partial memory, acquiring an incomplete universality by broken symmetry. Furthermore, we find the collapse is space-time dependent: the collapse onto the linear region of the master curve near the breakup tip persists for long time after breakup, while the parabolic region away from the tip is observed only for short time. We elucidate the physics in our findings, including the space-time dependent collapse, exploiting analogy with critical phenomena, which has guided recent developments across physics.</p>

            <h2>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami</p>
            <p>We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</p>

            <p>A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</p>

This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, however, or for sufficiently small systems, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</p>

We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included.

However, without comparing with mechanisms tied to disorder, it is still unclear whether the quantum metric dominates in recent experiments.

With the help of the formulas, we derive the scaling law to identify distinct mechanisms in the recent experiments [Gao, et al., Science 381, 181 (2023); Wang, et al., Nature 621, 487 (2023)], determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for all 122 magnetic point groups to guide future experiments, and calculate the nonlinear conductivity to explain the sophisticated features in the experiments of the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films.

            <p>Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</p>

In this context, an improved physical understanding of the g-factor of MoS2 depending on device geometry is of great importance. Resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) could be employed to and the determine the g-factor in micron-scale devices However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited by Schottky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g-factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~1.92 and observe that the g-factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Xu, Xue-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.</p>

            <p>Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</p>

            <h2>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SangEun Han, Shouryya Ray, Igor F. Herbut</p>
            <p>We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</p>

            <h2>Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debika Debnath, Paramita Dutta</p>
            <p>We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free JD based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</p>

            <h2>Redefining the dielectric response of nanoconfined liquids: insights from water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Zubeltzu, Fernando Bresme, Matthew Dawber, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Emilio Artacho</p>
            <p>Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarisability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used a very significant reduction, $\sim 30$\%, of the electronic response with respect to the bulk's is observed contrary to what widely assumed, highlighting the importance of electronic degrees of freedom to interpret the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions. This is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Thalmeier, Alireza Akbari, Burkhard Schmidt</p>
            <p>The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional superconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been identified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low magnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The latter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum dependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy magnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Purnendu Das, Sumilan Banerjee</p>
            <p>Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Trenins, Mariana Rossi</p>
            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. By employing a simple two-band model of the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction, we show that the linearly polarized light can generate the injection and shift currents when the Néel vector points to an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current is almost constant over a wide range of the frequency $\omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}<\hbar \omega <\hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.</p>

            <p>We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.</p>

            <p>Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</p>

In dispersions the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials, although the physical picture is often elusive. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, and we show that a simple, well-fitting model can induce misinterpretation of the physics in a complex material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</p>

            <p>We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov</p>
            <p>In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</p>

Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</p>

            <p>As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal becomes necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.</p>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</p>

The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures.

In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz~7.7 of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</p>

            <p>Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.</p>

            <p>Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Karbowski</p>
            <p>Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu</p>
            <p>When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observe anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated because of the implied symmetries between the two steady states, on the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition mode under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effects are no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</p>

            <h2>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos, Stam Nicolis</p>
            <p>We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l>2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</p>

            <h2>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Kobayashi, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Chen, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Bing-Xin Lao</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</p>

            <p>Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</p>

            <h2>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Kerr Winter, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen</p>
            <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</p>

            <p>We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</p>

            <h2>Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces & maximum spreading diameter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vatsal Sanjay, Detlef Lohse</p>
            <p>The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.</p>

            <p>We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</p>

            <h2>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Wesle, Giovanna Marcelli, Tadahiro Miyao, Domenico Monaco, Stefan Teufel</p>
            <p>We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_{\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance. A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</p>

The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant red-shift of the H-H stretch frequency is found as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</p>

The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-Pérot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz.

A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Bigoni, Andrea Piccolroaz</p>
            <p>Two classes of non-linear elastic materials are derived via two-dimensional homogenization. These materials are equivalent to a periodic grid of axially-deformable and axially-preloaded structural elements, subject to incremental deformations that involve bending, shear, and normal forces. The unit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are lumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other class involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with sufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the elasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and subsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions, this loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is, the material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness domain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable state. This effect is closely related to the axial compliance of the elements. Our results: (i.) demonstrate new possibilities for exploiting structural elements within the elastic range, characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom, to create architected materials with tuneable instabilities, (ii.) introduce reconfigurable materials characterized by 'islands' of stability or instability.</p>

With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</p>

This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</p>

            <p>A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</p>

            <p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</p>

            <h2>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza</p>
            <p>The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</p>

            <h2>Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicola J. Fairbairn, Olga Vodianova, Gordon J. Hedley</p>
            <p>The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.</p>

            <h2>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayarshi Bhattacharya, Gautam Gangopadhyay, Sunandan Gangopadhyay</p>
            <p>This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Noise equals endogenous control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric De Giuli</p>
            <p>Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</p>

            <h2>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alvise Bastianello, Alexey Tikan, Francois Copie, Stephane Randoux, Pierre Suret</p>
            <p>In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aya Abouelela, Michael Turaev, Roman Kramer, Moritz Janning, Michael Kajan, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.</p>

            <h2>Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tigran V. Shahbazyan</p>
            <p>We develop a non-Lorentzian approach for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the exact LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of Maxwell-Bloch equations which describe LSP in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE coupled to the LSP, we obtain an explicit expression for the system effective optical polarizability which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the classical coupled oscillator (CO) model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from the temporal dispersion of metal dielectric function affect dramatically the optical spectra as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight is shifted towards the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Magneto-optical Kerr effect in two-dimensional non-collinear antiferromagnetic material HfFeCl6</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Zhou, Ning Ding, Haoshen Ye, Shuai Dong, Shan-Shan Wang</p>
            <p>With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to a scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal (T) and time-inversion (TI) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.</p>

We propose an experimental setup to measure the statistical angle of topological anyons emitted from a quantum point contact (QPC) source.

In the weak tunneling regime, we calculate the charge current, showing its time evolution depends solely on the anyons' statistical properties, with temperature and scaling dimension affecting only the constant prefactor. We compute the cross-correlation between the anyon current transmitted from the source and the current after the junction, providing a direct method to detect anyon braiding statistics.</p>

            <h2>Multi-orbital effects on superconductivity in kagome metals: Parquet renormalization group analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jae-Ho Han, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>The Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where the electronic density of states diverges due to saddle points in the band structure, play a crucial role in enhancing electronic correlations and driving various instabilities. In particular, VHS-induced superconductivity has earned significant attention due to its potential to achieve high transition temperatures and its tendency to favor exotic pairing states beyond conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Despite extensive research on VHS-driven superconductivity, the multi-orbital effect on such systems remains less explored. Motivated by recent experiments on several kagome metals under doping and pressure [this http URL {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.B {\bf 103}, 224513 (2021), this http URL {\it et al.}, this http URL. {\bf 14}, 3899 (2023)], we explore the effects of multi-orbital physics and strong correlations induced by VHS in the kagome lattice, focusing on their impact on superconductivity. Using parquet renormalization group analysis, we uncover eight distinct superconducting instabilities, characterized by order parameters with mixed orbital degrees of freedom. Among these, we identify a parameter regime where $d$-wave-like orbital-singlet spin-triplet order parameters dominate as the leading instability. The degenerate spin-triplet states in this regime are capable of breaking time-reversal symmetry, which is a multi-orbital analogue of chiral spin-triplet superconductivity. These findings highlight the interplay between multi-orbital effects on superconductivity and can apply to the kagome metal systems such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) family.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and topologically nontrivial states. While AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have been extensively studied in this context, the broader AB3C5 family remains largely unexplored. In this work, we employ machine-learning-accelerated, high-throughput density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the stability and electronic properties of kagome materials derived from atomic substitutions in the AV3Sb5 structure. We identify 36 promising candidates that are thermodynamically stable, with many more close to the convex hull. Stable compounds are not only found with a pnictogen (Sb or Bi) as the C atom but also with Au, Hg, Tl, and Ce. This diverse chemistry opens the way to tune the electronic properties of the compounds. In fact, many of these compounds exhibit Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, or flat bands close to the Fermi level. Our findings provide an array of compounds for experimental synthesis and further theoretical exploration of kagome superconductors beyond the already known systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum defects in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for THz-technologies</h2>

            <p>Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realizing a single photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, laying the foundation for next generation THz quantum technologies, a timely and significant research area given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</p>

            <p>The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>

            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10 mK and at 6 GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6 GHz niobium cavity at 10 mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100 mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$ 10 mG limits $Q_0\sim$ 10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$ 350 ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$ 1 s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</p>

            <p>We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</p>

By exploiting the incommensurate nature of the twisted bilayer, we observe a significant enhancement of long-range susceptibility, suggesting the formation of stable entangled states between spatially distant localized spins. We further show that the tunability of the interlayer coupling in terms of driving fields enables us to manipulate these entangled states without deformation of lattice structure and extra doping. Our findings provide a pathway for overcoming challenges in establishing strong correlations across distant sites, highlighting the potential of optical lattices as a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies.</p>

Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals the emergence of narrow emission lines redshifted from the MoSe$_2$ neutral exciton by up to $\sim100\,$meV, depending on the sample structure. The spatial distribution, excitation energy response and polarization properties of the emission is consistent with signatures of 1D-confined excitons. The large electric field gradients accessible via proximal ferroelectric systems open up new avenues for the creation of robust quantum-confined excitons in atomically thin materials and their heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Dzero, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Collective modes in superconductors provided the first realization of the Higgs mechanism. The transverse Goldstone mode acquires a gap (i.e. a mass) when it hybridizes with the electromagnetic gauge field. The longitudinal Schmid-Higgs mode, on the other hand, is always massive. In conventional BCS theory, its gap is exactly $2\Delta$, coinciding with the excitation threshold for quasiparticles. Being situated right at the edge of the continuum spectrum it gives rise to peculiar dynamics for the Schmid-Higgs mode. For instance, when suddenly excited at $t=0$, it exhibits algebraically decaying oscillations of the form $\sim \sin(2\Delta t)/{t}^{1/2}$. In this study, we explore the behavior of Schmid-Higgs oscillations in the presence of pair-breaking mechanisms, such as magnetic impurities or in-plane magnetic fields. These processes suppress the quasiparticle excitation threshold down to $2\varepsilon_g < 2\Delta$, potentially placing the longitudinal mode within the continuum spectrum. Despite this, we show that the algebraically decaying oscillations persist, taking the form $\sim \sin(2\varepsilon_g t)/t^2$. The Schmid-Higgs mode becomes truly overdamped and exponentially decaying only in the gapless superconductors with $\varepsilon_g=0$.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopic response of superconducting La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) thin films as a function of $T$ across a wide range of doping levels from mildly underdoped through extremely overdoped ($T_c < 5$ K). In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in the superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz nonlinearity. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional superconductor NbN where the strong nonlinear response promptly disappears at $T_c$. The size of the nonlinear susceptibility in LSCO is $|\chi^{(3)}|\approx 2.2\times10^{-9} m^2/V^2$, which is one of the largest THz range nonlinearities ever measured. The 2DCS measurement shows that the dominant normal state nonlinearities arise from pump-probe processes, of which there are various possible origins. These may be related to the unconventional interactions that lead to the strange metal or the persistence of superconducting correlations to high temperatures. Irrespective of its origin, the large normal state nonlinearity provides an opportunity to measure the energy relaxation rate ($\Gamma_E$) to temperatures where the momentum relaxation rate is linear in T and close to its ``Planckian" form ($\Gamma_M \approx 2kT/h$). We find $\Gamma_E$ to be $10 - 40$ times smaller than the momentum relaxation. This shows that the scattering that causes momentum loss (and $T$-linear) resistivity do not remove appreciable energy from the electrons. Although the $T$-dependence of the momentum relaxation is consistent with quasi-elastic scattering off bosonic collective modes at temperatures above their characteristic energy (the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature for acoustic phonons) it is inconsistent with $\Gamma_E$'s temperature dependence. $\Gamma_E$ is an increasing function of $T$, which is indicative of {\it inelastic} scattering to the phonon bath.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter.

Our thermodynamic measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 7.45 K and a subsequent magnetic phase transition at TN1 = 7.15 K. Our transport studies indicate a semimetallic behavior with unusual feature in the ordered state. Our ARPES measurements revealed a diamond-shaped Fermi pocket centered at the G point, with band features that evolve distinctly across various binding energies. STM/S results indicate a minimum in the density of states at around 100 meV below the Fermi level, and ARPES measurements reveal a significant gap present around the X point, differentiating DySbTe from other LnSbTe compounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the SOC effects on the electronic structure and topological properties in the LnSbTe family, highlighting DySbTe as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between topology and magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Quantum skyrmions and antiskyrmions in monoaxial chiral magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Liscak, Andreas Haller, Andreas Michels, Thomas L. Schmidt, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin</p>
            <p>Classical monoaxial chiral magnets represent a unique magnetic system that allows for the stabilization of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions of equal energy. Unlike a similar situation in frustrated magnets, the energy landscape here is much simpler, consisting of four states: the saturated ferromagnetic state, spin-spiral, skyrmion, and antiskyrmion. This simplicity makes such systems interesting for potential applications that rely on manipulating these states. We study the quantum analog of the already established classical theory by investigating the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we establish that such a model supports the existence of skyrmion and antiskyrmion states of equal energy. This degeneracy allows for the existence of a mesoscopic Schrödinger cat state exhibiting properties of both skyrmion and antiskyrmion. To characterize this superposition, we calculate two-point correlation functions that can be measured in neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we introduce a perturbation in the form of a magnetic field gradient to induce a non-trivial time evolution of the superposition state. We study this time evolution using both a numerical variational approach and the collective coordinates method.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling density of states in exotic superconductors and spatial patterns of particle-hole interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archisman Panigrahi, Vladislav Poliakov, Leonid Levitov</p>
            <p>Tunneling spectroscopy of superconductors provides valuable insights into gap symmetry, quasiparticle dynamics, and pairing mechanisms. This paper explores spatial patterns of quasiparticle interference in the tunneling density of states (TDOS) near localized impurities. These patterns emerge because Bogoliubov quasiparticles, as coherent superpositions of electrons and holes, drive reversible particle-to-hole conversion within the superconductor. Impurities act as beam splitters, generating interference between particle and hole states, forming spatial fringes reminiscent of Young's double-slit experiment. In topological superconductors, these interference patterns are further modulated by nodal lines that encode the nodal structure and phase of the gap function, $\Delta(\vec p)$. Notably, the patterns directly reveal the winding number of $\Delta(\vec p)$ phase, offering a unique probe of exotic, non-BCS pairing and a powerful tool for detecting topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>In the present work, we introduce a new interpretation of exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) materials using concepts from brane physics. We adapt the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-Shifman mechanism to a (2+1)-dimensional brane in a (3+1)-D spacetime, deriving an effective electromagnetic potential on the brane. Using this potential, we develop a hydrogenic model for exciton binding energies in 2D materials, applying it to s-type excitons and comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results on WS$_{2}$ monolayers. This interdisciplinary approach bridges high-energy and condensed matter physics, offering a new didactic representation of excitons in low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Pioldi, G. De Simoni, A. Braggio, F. Giazotto</p>
            <p>Owing to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions are leveraged in various thermal devices. This study illustrates that two NISIN reservoirs can achieve a measurable negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC). This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under appropriate configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, leading to NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations where it is possible to discriminate this effect unambiguously. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges. This advances the development of devices that exploit NDTC to enhance heat and temperature regulation in cryogenic environments, such as thermal switches, transistors, and amplifiers.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</h2>

            <p>Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene has recently emerged as an exciting platform for a possible chiral superconducting state. Here, we theoretically demonstrate and study the emergence of nonreciprocal superconductivity and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect in this system. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism to superconductivity and show that large diode efficiencies, $\sim$ 60%, are achievable and highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we also find that the diodicity shows a characteristic angular dependence with multiple enhanced lobes, which depend on the Fermi surface structure of the underlying normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator.

            <p>We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</p>

            <p>We introduce a definition of coarse-grained entropy that unifies measurement-based (observational entropy) and max-entropy-based (Jaynes) approaches to coarse-graining, by identifying physical constraints with information theoretic priors. The definition is shown to include as special cases most other entropies of interest in physics. We then consider second laws, showing that the definition admits new entropy increase theorems and connections to thermodynamics. We survey mathematical properties of the definition, and show it resolves some pathologies of the traditional observational entropy in infinite dimensions. Finally, we study the dynamics of this entropy in a quantum random matrix model and a classical hard sphere gas. Together the results suggest that this generalized observational entropy can form the basis of a highly general approach to statistical mechanics.</p>

We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.</p>

            <p>Information and free-energy maximization are physics principles that provide general rules for an agent to optimize actions in line with specific goals and policies. These principles are the building blocks for designing decision-making policies capable of efficient performance with only partial information. Notably, the information maximization principle has shown remarkable success in the classical bandit problem and has recently been shown to yield optimal algorithms for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian reward distributions. This article explores a broad extension of physics-based approaches to more complex and structured bandit problems. To this end, we cover three distinct types of bandit problems, where information maximization is adapted and leads to strong performance. Since the main challenge of information maximization lies in avoiding over-exploration, we highlight how information is tailored at various levels to mitigate this issue, paving the way for more efficient and robust decision-making strategies.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Interactions in Particle Suspensions: A Perspective on Stokesian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim William Torre, Joost de Graaf</p>
            <p>Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a numerical framework used for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particle suspensions at low Reynolds number. It combines far-field approximations with near-field lubrication corrections, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This work reviews SD and provides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the mathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the computational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively. We also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency, including the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition, we highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective approximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than made in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full many-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data. That is, we correct the RPY approximation, while avoiding costly matrix inversions. We demonstrate the potential of this method on a simple system, where we find a close match to SD data while algorithmically outperforming RPY. Our work provides an outlook on the way in which large-scale simulations of particle suspensions can be performed in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <h2>Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazhir Aliahmadi, Aidan Sheedy, Greg van Anders</p>
            <p>Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</p>

            <p>Networks of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are a promising material for thermoelectric energy harvesting due to their mechanical flexibility, solution processability, high Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities after chemical p- or n-doping. Here, we demonstrate that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) for electrolyte counterions is a promising method for p-doping of polymer-sorted semiconducting SWNT networks. The achieved doping levels, as determined from absorption bleaching, depend directly on both the pH of the aqueous doping solutions and the bandgap (i.e., diameter) of the nanotubes within the network. Fast screening of different nanotube networks under various doping conditions was enabled by a high-throughput setup for thermoelectric measurements of five samples in parallel. For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to reach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those obtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the electrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days in air. These results confirm PCET to be a suitable approach for more environmentally friendly and stable doping of semiconducting SWNTs as promising thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have shown that parasitic two-level systems (TLS) in superconducting qubits, which are a leading source of decoherence, can have relaxation times longer than the qubits themselves. However, the standard techniques used to characterize qubit relaxation is only valid for measuring $T_1$ under Markovian assumptions and could mask such non-Markovian behavior of the environment in practice. Here, we introduce two-timescale relaxometry, a technique to probe the qubit and environment relaxation simultaneously and efficiently. We apply it to high-coherence fluxonium qubits over a frequency range of 0.1-0.4 GHz, which reveals a discrete spectrum of TLS with millisecond lifetimes. Our analysis of the spectrum is consistent with a random distribution of TLS in the aluminum oxide tunnel barrier of the Josephson junction chain of the fluxonium with an average density and electric dipole similar to previous TLS studies at much higher frequencies. Our study suggests that investigating and mitigating TLS in the junction chain is crucial to the development of various types of noise-protected qubits in circuit QED.</p>

In this work, we present a bi-scaling theory for the probability density function of first passage times in confined compact processes, applicable to both Euclidean and Fractal domains, diverse geometries, and scenarios with or without external force fields, accommodating Markovian and semi-Markovian random walks. In large systems, first passage time statistics exhibit a bi-scaling behavior, challenging the use of a single time scale. Our theory employs two distinct scaling functions: one for short times, capturing initial dynamics in unbounded systems, and the other for long times is sensitive to finite size effects. The combined framework provides a complete expression for first passage time statistics across all time scales.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</p>

            <p>Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</p>

Our proposed material encoding has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the other characterizing the chemical composition, that we call Pettifor embedding. For the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. We show that the Pettifor embeddings systematically outperform other commonly used elemental embeddings in compositional machine learning models. Using the Pettifor embeddings to define a distance metric and applying dimension reduction techniques, we construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according to basic physical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-Yu Chen, Lijia Jiang, Wen-Kai Bai, Tao Yang, Jun-Hui Zheng</p>
            <p>Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here, we come up with a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.</p>

            <h2>Strain rate sensitivity of a Cu/Al$_2$O$_3$ multi-layered thin film</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Szilvia Kalácska, László Pethő, Guillaume Kermouche, Johann Michler, Péter Dusán Ispánovity</p>
            <p>To study the size and strain rate dependency of copper polycrystalline microstructures, a multi-layered copper/Al$_2$O$_3$ thin film was deposited on a Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system (combining physical vapour and atomic layer deposition). High temperature treatment was applied on the ``As Deposited" material with ultrafine-grained structure to increase the average grain size, resulting in a ``Heat Treated" state with microcrystalline structure. Focused ion beam milling was employed to create square shaped micropillars with two different sizes, that were subjected to compressive loading at various (0.001/s -- 1000/s) strain rates. Differences in the strain rate sensitivity behavior manifesting at low and high strain rates are discussed in the context of the pillar diameters and the grain size of the deformed samples. The Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer studied by transmission electron microscopy showed excellent thermal stability and grain boundary pinning by precipitation, also resulting in the homogeneous deformation of the pillars and preventing shear localization. Geometrically necessary dislocation densities estimated by high (angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction presented inhomogeneous dislocation distribution within the deformed pillar volumes, that is attributed to the proximity of the sample edges. Finally, the Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayers successfully suppressed any possible recrystallization processes, contributing to the excellent film stability, that makes the proposed coating ideal to be operating under extreme conditions.</p>

            <h2>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</h2>

            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Foligno, Bruno Bertini</p>
            <p>The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</p>

            <p>It has been proposed that diabatic quantum annealing (DQA), which turns off the transverse field at a finite speed, produces samples well described by the Boltzmann distribution. We analytically show that, up to linear order in quenching time, the DQA approximates a high-temperature Boltzmann distribution.

Based on this result, we discuss how the DQA can be utilized to train the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).</p>

            <h2>Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</p>

            <p>In systems with unconventional Rashba bands, we propose that a finite-momentum pairing state can emerge without the need for an external magnetic field. We analyze the phase transition from a zero-momentum Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to a finite-momentum pairing state using a microscopic interaction model. We demonstrate that the coexistence of zero-momentum and Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type pairings in different channels provides a well understanding of recent experimental observations of pair-density-wave (PDW) states. Furthermore, we propose that an s-wave BCS superconductor-unconventional Rashba metal (SC-URM) junction can generate an LO-type pairing state via an orbital-selective proximity effect. This nontrivial state can be detected by measuring the Josephson current in an SC-URM-SC junction or through Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy/spectrosscopy (JSTM/S). Our results reveal that the internal multi-orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in facilitating finite-momentum pairing states.</p>

Flux creep is a phenomenon observed under the assumption that the material under study can trap magnetic flux, and thus, Fig. 4c serves as evidence that H$_{3}$S traps magnetic flux and is a high-temperature superconductor. The claim remains unchanged even in the recently published Author Correction [2] to Ref. [1]. However, Ref. [2] discloses an experimental protocol they used to collect the time-dependent magnetic moment data. In this Matters Arising, we point out that the protocol is not applicable to H$_{3}$S under high pressure and propose an alternative protocol. The correct protocol demonstrates that the claim in Refs.

            <p>Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties.

Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanyu Duan, Zecheng Gan</p>
            <p>Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Teza, John Bechhoefer, Antonio Lasanta, Oren Raz, Marija Vucelja</p>
            <p>Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</p>

            <p>Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</p>

            <p>This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Sadeghizade, R. Jafari, A. Langari</p>
            <p>In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</p>

Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes.

            <p>The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</p>

            <p>We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved.

We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</p>

            <p>The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity in the Schrödinger Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng-Zhang He, Hai-Qing Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the Krylov complexity of Schrödinger field theories, focusing on both bosonic and fermionic systems within the grand canonical ensemble that includes a chemical potential. Krylov complexity measures operator growth in quantum systems by analyzing how operators spread within the Krylov space, a subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by successive applications of the superoperator $[H,\cdot]$ on an initial operator. Using the Lanczos algorithm, we construct an orthonormal Krylov basis and derive the Lanczos coefficients, which govern the operator connectivity and thus characterize the complexity. Our study reveals that the Lanczos coefficients $\{b_{n}\}$ are independent of the chemical potential, while $\{a_{n}\}$ exhibits a dependence on it. Both $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ show linear relationships with respect to $n$. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, the Krylov complexities behave similarly over time, especially at late times, due to the analogous profiles of the squared absolute values of their autocorrelation functions $\abs{\varphi_{0}(t)}^{2}$. The Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time, but its asymptotic scaling factor $\lambda_{K}$ is significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of the $\{b_{n}\}$ coefficients, contrasting to the relativistic field theories where the scaling aligns more closely with the twice of the slope of $\{b_{n}\}$.</p>

            <h2>Fast, accurate, and error-resilient variational quantum noise spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nanako Shitara, Andrés Montoya-Castillo</p>
            <p>Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</p>

            <p>We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</p>

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Dichtl, Thorsten Schumacher, Markus Lippitz</p>
            <p>Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

            <h2>Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Robust strong-field theory model for ultrafast electron transport through metal-insulator-metal tunneling nanojunctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyang Ma, Michael Krüger</p>
            <p>Ultrafast science studies the dynamics of electrons in matter with extreme temporal precision, typically in the attosecond and femtosecond time domain. Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [Boyang Ma and Michael Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236901 (2024)], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter $\zeta$ that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\zeta > 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. $\zeta < 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kumar Srivastav, Mrityunjay Kundu</p>
            <p>We propose a method for the laser-excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons via the linear mode conversion of terahertz radiation on a graphene sheet deposited on an n-type semiconductor in presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the semiconductor surface. An obliquely incident p-polarized laser beam interacting with the graphene n-InSb semiconductor surface, imparts linear oscillatory velocity to the free electrons. This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser. This mechanism has the potential to enable the development of an actively tunable plasmonic device.</p>

            <p>We study the nonlinear Hall effect in superconductors without magnetic fields induced by a quantum geometric phase (i.e., the Aharonov-Bohm phase) carried by single or pair particles. We find that the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity diverges in the dc limit in a robust way against dissipation when the system is superconducting, suggesting that the supercurrent flows perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. This superconducting nonlinear Hall effect (SNHE) is demonstrated for the Haldane model with attractive interaction and its variant with pair hoppings. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the SNHE can be understood as those arising from a higher-order Lifshitz invariant, that is, a symmetry invariant constructed from order parameters that contains an odd number of spatial derivatives. We perform real-time simulations including the effect of collective modes for the models driven by a multi-cycle pulse, and show that the SNHE leads to large rectification of the Hall current under light driving.</p>

Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena.

            <p>A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique windows into the properties of strongly correlated electrons. Their generation can be used to drive magnetic phase transitions, manipulate spins coherently, or access novel non-equilibrium regimes. Despite extensive investigation into the spin physics of CrI3, exciton dynamics in this archetypal magnetic 2D material remain underexplored. Here, we report the use of Yb3+ impurity point defects as exciton annihilators to probe exciton diffusion in CrI3. Variable-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements for a series of x% Yb3+:CrI3 samples reveal thermally activated Dexter-type site-to-site hopping of excitons, with low exciton diffusivity associated with strong electron-nuclear coupling. Using Monte Carlo modeling calibrated by the experimental data, diffusivities are found to be orders of magnitudes lower than in 2D vdW semiconductors. Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) are below ~3 nm at all temperatures, and thus well below the optical diffraction limit. These results have basic implications for the use of excitons to probe and manipulate their surroundings in this and related magnetic CrX3 materials.</p>

The thermally activated magnons in the bilayer lead to a hybrid excitation between magnon modes in the conductive Py layer with a wide wavevector range and the first perpendicular standing magnon modes in the insulating YIG layer, facilitated by strong interfacial exchange coupling. To further investigate this coupling, we compare the thermal magnon spectra with the results obtained from electrical excitation and detection methods, which primarily detect the uniform Py mode. The realization of coherent coupling between incoherent (thermal) magnons is important for advancing energy-efficient magnonic devices, particularly in classical as well as quantum spin-wave computing technologies.</p>

            <p>Elucidating mechanical deformation in glassy materials at the atomic level is challenging due to their disordered atomic structure. Using our novel "frozen atom analysis," we reveal that anelastic deformation in CuZr metallic glasses is fundamentally driven by cooperative atomic motions of approximately 40 elastically linked atoms, forming trigger groups. They initiate localized rearrangements, which can cascade into plastic flow. Notably, these groups show no distinct structural or physical features, challenging the idea that deformation occurs in defective regions. Instead, deformation events are highly stochastic and transient, driven by collective atomic motion. This finding not only reshapes our understanding of glassy material deformation mechanisms but also highlights cooperative motion as a key factor in avalanche-like phenomena governing the behavior of disordered systems across multiple scales.</p>

We identify proximity-induced superconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization between Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold increase in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states to the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where superconductivity emerges at both the $\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the substrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for superconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic superconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different k-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging states unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole hybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments. Our findings highlight the decisive impact of substrate (hybridization, strain, charge transfer, magnetic order) on the superconducting properties of FeSe. We suggest potential pathways for engineering novel high-temperature FeSe-based superconductors by leveraging interfacial interactions in substrates with high electron affinity.</p>

            <h2>Exact calculation of spectral properties of a particle interacting with a one-dimensional Fermi gas in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu</p>
            <p>By using the exact Bethe wavefunctions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with $N$ spin-up fermions and one spin-down impurity, we derive an analytic expression of the impurity form factor, in the form of a determinant of a $(N+1)$ by $(N+1)$ matrix. This analytic expression enables us to exactly calculate spectral properties of one-dimensional Fermi polarons in lattices, when the masses of the impurity particle and the Fermi bath are equal. We present the impurity spectral function as functions of the on-site interaction strength and the filling factor of the Fermi bath, and discuss the origin of Fermi singularities in the spectral function at small momentum and the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at large momentum near the boundary of Brillouin zone. Our analytic expression of the impurity form factors pave the way to exploring the intriguing dynamics of a particle interacting with a Fermi bath. Our exact predictions on the impurity spectral function could be directly examined in cold-atom laboratories by using the radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting diode effect in Ising superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itai Bankier, Lotan Attias, Alex Levchenko, Maxim Khodas</p>
            <p>We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I >> \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R << T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I >> \Delta_R \neq 0$.</p>

            <h2>Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier</p>
            <p>The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.</p>

The optimized lattice parameters are a=7.406 Å, b=21.425 Å, c=9.529 Å, and agree very well with the experimental data, thanks to the local Coulomb interactions and van der Waals forces included in the calculations. The investigation considers several magnetic orderings. The lowest total energy was found for the antiferromagnetic configuration with the magnetic moment of $\sim4.6~\mu_{\text{B}}$ per Fe atom. The electronic structure calculation shows the Mott insulating state with the energy gap $E_g=2.87$~eV. For the relaxed crystal structure, the elastic properties were obtained and analyzed. The phonon dispersion relations and density of states were calculated within the temperature-dependent effective potential methodusing atomic multidisplacements obtained by high efficiency configuration space sampling.</p>

            <p>Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that LiMnPO$_4$ and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.</p>

            <h2>Controlled Diagonal Catalyst Improves the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Hattori, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.</p>

            <p>This work develops an analytical model to consistently interpret the steady-state and small-perturbation response (both in the time and frequency domain) of photoanodes for solar water-splitting. In addition to accounting for the fundamental mechanisms of charge-carrier generation, recombination and slow hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, the model overcomes the key shortcomings of existing models in the literature. These include consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit potential, that corresponds to an electron mobility of 0.022 cm2V-1s-1. The model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the literature in the case of hematite photoanodes. The generality of the model allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Magneto-Raman spectroscopy is applied to study spin-phonon coupling in the layered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We report on the effects of temperature and external magnetic field on Raman-active phonons of $A_g$ symmetry in bulk and one-to-six-layer forms of CrSBr that are reflected by the Raman spectral patterns measured at different configurations of circularly polarized laser beam. The results of experimental investigations reveal that spin-spin and spin-phonon interactions play a significant role below the Néel temperature and are notably stronger in CrSBr monolayer than in bulk material. Spin-phonon coupling leads to the emergence of \textit{ new} phonon peaks at very low temperatures. Such effect is solely observed in one-to-six-layer CrSBr and is absent in its bulk form. Our experimental research is accompanied by \textit{ab initio} simulations of the Raman spectra of bulk and monolayer CrSBr that uncover correlations between intensities of Raman-active phonons and the arrangement of spin magnetic moments on Cr atoms. Comparative analysis of simulated and experimental Raman spectra suggests the most favored spin orientation in the CrSBr antiferromagnetic system.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, exhibiting high power conversion efficiency due to strong light absorption and long carrier diffusion lengths. While various aspects of their crystal and electronic structure have been studied, we identify a fundamental property previously overlooked that may significantly impact their efficiency. We demonstrate that halide perovskites realize a three-dimensional (3D) Lieb lattice, giving rise to a gapped 3D Dirac cone of spin-1 fermions. This leads to a fivefold reduction in effective mass compared to a conventional cubic structure and suppressed carrier backscattering due to Klein tunneling. Our conclusions are supported by band structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$. In particular, we reveal the transformation of the flat band of the Lieb lattice and the emergence of a dark corridor effect in photoemission from the Dirac cone, which increases as the band gap is decreased from CsPbBr$_3$ to CsSnBr$_3$.</p>

            <p>We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</p>

            <p>We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.</p>

            <p>Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in various biological and soft matter systems. This anomalous dynamics is typically attributed to heterogeneous environments inducing spatiotemporal variations in the diffusivity of tracer particles. While previous studies have predominantly focused on systems exhibiting either spatial or temporal heterogeneity, this work bridges the gap by introducing a model based on an annealed extreme landscape to simultaneously account for both types of heterogeneities. Through a combination of computational analyses and analytical derivations, we investigate how the interplay of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the energy landscape gives rise to Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of temporal environmental fluctuations, the heterogeneous diffusion inevitably converges to classical Brownian motion via a homogenization process. We derive an analytical expression for the homogenization time as a function of key parameters governing the system's spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Additionally, we quantify particle-to-particle diffusion heterogeneity and examine the ergodic properties of this model, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of complex, heterogeneous systems.</p>

            <p>The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</p>

            <p>The Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) is a recent concept proposed to maintain the thermal stability of standard MRAM at small diameters, considering thick vertical pillars as the free layer. In order to explore the specific physics of PSA-STT-MRAMs expected in relation with their three-dimensional nature, we have performed simulations combining a micromagnetic model coupled self-consistently with spin-dependent transport equations. The 3D shape induces flower states at the upper and lower surfaces. Besides, the field-like component of STT is found to be larger than in standard MRAMs, suggesting that it needs to be considered. The combination of both effects leads to the excitation of high-order 3D ferromagnetic resonance modes, playing a key role in magnetisation reversal. These results highlight features of 3D nanomagnetic systems, largely disregarded so far, which need to be considered to optimise PSA-STT-MRAM to be a competitive solution for technological implementation.</p>

            <p>In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of fast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local proton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion rotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural network force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are initially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation, and the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the conventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent proton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural similarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms between CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations. CsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different activation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The higher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$ polyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$. Additionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in CsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to CsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could accelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified framework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid compounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and disordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirko Daumann, Thomas Dahm</p>
            <p>The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>We present a dynamical model of crystal growth, in which it is possible to reliably achieve asymmetric products, beginning from symmetric initial conditions and growing within an isotropic environment. The asymmetric growth is the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of thermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline facets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the persistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general by studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of symmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses of single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting surfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental observables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of the surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of asymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.</p>

            <p>Twisted layered van-der-Waals materials often exhibit unique electronic and optical properties absent in their non-twisted counterparts. Unfortunately, predicting such properties is hindered by the difficulty in determining the atomic structure in materials displaying large moiré domains. Here, we introduce a split machine-learned interatomic potential and dataset curation approach that separates intralayer and interlayer interactions and significantly improves model accuracy -- with a tenfold increase in energy and force prediction accuracy relative to conventional models. We further demonstrate that traditional MLIP validation metrics -- force and energy errors -- are inadequate for moiré structures and develop a more holistic, physically-motivated metric based on the distribution of stacking configurations. This metric effectively compares the entirety of large-scale moiré domains between two structures instead of relying on conventional measures evaluated on smaller commensurate cells. Finally, we establish that one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moiré structures can serve as efficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical model validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our framework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions directly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer interaction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moiré materials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated accuracy.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a "valley-independent Chern number", measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</p>

DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</p>

            <p>Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</p>

            <h2>Interacting non-Hermitian edge and cluster bursts on a digital quantum processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Ming Koh, Wen-Tan Xue, Tommy Tai, Dax Enshan Koh, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>A lossy quantum system harboring the non-Hermitian skin effect can in certain conditions exhibit anomalously high loss at the boundaries of the system compared to the bulk, a phenomenon termed the non-Hermitian edge burst. We uncover interacting many-body extensions of the edge burst that are spatially extended and patterned, as well as cluster bursts that occur away from boundaries. Owing to the methodological difficulty and overhead of accurately realizing non-Hermitian dynamical evolution, much less tunable interactions, few experimental avenues in studying the single-particle edge burst have been reported to date and none for many-body variants. We overcome these roadblocks in this study, and present a realization of edge and cluster bursts in an interacting quantum ladder model on a superconducting quantum processor. We utilize a time-stepping algorithm, which implements time-evolution by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by composing a linear combination of unitaries scheme and product formulae, to assess long-time behavior of the system. We observe signatures of the non-Hermitian edge burst on up to 64 unit cells, and detect the closing of the dissipative gap, a necessary condition for the edge burst, by probing the imaginary spectrum of the system. In suitable interacting regimes, we identify the emergence of spatial patterning and cluster bursts. Beyond establishing these generalized forms of edge burst phenomena, our study paves the way for digital quantum processors to be harnessed as a versatile platform for non-Hermitian condensed-matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yahui Li, Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei Motrunich</p>
            <p>Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a systematic procedure based on optimal control theory to address the full counting statistics of particle transport in a stochastic system. Our approach enhances the performance of a Thouless pump in the non-adiabatic regime by simultaneously optimizing the average pumping rate while minimizing noise. We demonstrate our optimization procedure on a paradigmatic model for the electronic transport through a quantum dot, both in the limit of vanishing Coulomb interaction and in the interacting regime. Our method enables independent control of the moments associated with charge and spin transfer, allowing for the enhancement of spin current with minimal charge current or the independent tuning of spin and charge fluctuations. These results underscore the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to a broad class of stochastic systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino</p>
            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10~mK and at 6~GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6~GHz niobium cavity at 10~mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100~mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$~10~mG limits $Q_0\sim$~10\textsuperscript{10}, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$~1~s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Scaling our findings to typical transmon qubit dimensions suggests that these 2-D structures could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds~mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</p>

            <h2>Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch</p>
            <p>The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</p>

            <p>We introduce parallel-sequential (PS) circuits, a family of quantum circuit layouts that interpolate between brickwall and sequential circuits, which introduces control parameters governing the ratio of over the amount of entanglement and the maximum correlation distance they can express. We provide numerical evidence that PS circuits can efficiently prepare many-body ground states in one dimension. On noisy devices, characterized through both idling errors and two-qubit gate errors, we show that in a wide parameter regime, PS circuits outperform brickwall, sequential, and log-depth circuits from [Malz, Styliaris, Wei, Cirac, PRL 132, 040404 (2024)]. Additionally, we demonstrate that properly chosen noisy random PS circuits suppress error proliferation and, when employed as a variational ansatz, exhibit superior trainability.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of enhanced nuclear safety has spurred the development of accident-tolerant cladding (ATC) materials for light water reactors (LWRs). This study investigates the potential of repurposing these ATCs in advanced reactor designs, aiming to expedite material development and reduce costs. The research employs a multi-physics approach, encompassing neutronics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, and structural mechanics, to evaluate four candidate materials (Haynes 230, Zircaloy-4, FeCrAl, and SiC-SiC) within the context of a high-temperature, sodium-cooled microreactor, exemplified by the Kilopower design. While neutronic simulations revealed negligible power profile variations among the materials, finite element analyses highlighted the superior thermal stability of SiC-SiC and the favorable stress resistance of Haynes 230. The high-temperature environment significantly impacted material performance, particularly for Zircaloy-4 and FeCrAl, while SiC-SiC's inherent properties limited its ability to withstand stress loads. Additionally, AI-driven uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the influence of material property variations on maximum hoop stress. The findings underscore the need for further research into high-temperature material properties to facilitate broader applicability of existing materials to advanced reactors. Haynes 230 is identified as the most promising candidate based on the evaluated criteria.</p>

            <h2>Cyclic Voltammetry of Ion-Coupled Electron Transfer Reactions for Diagnosing Energy Storage Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keyvan Malaie</p>
            <p>The methods of Nicholson and Shain and Randles-Sevcik are the paradigms of voltammetry of redox species. However, as they were originally developed for aqueous redox couples, they cannot be directly applied to solid redox films such as those of battery materials. Herein, for the first time, we present a cyclic voltammetry model based on semi-infinite linear diffusion for ion-coupled electron transfer reactions. The simulated CVs contain parameters such as capacity, ion activity, formal potential of proton-coupled electron transfer, and scan rate that are physically more meaningful than those of the current models in characterizing energy storage materials. We apply this model to the MnO2 cathode material as a proof of concept and discuss the significance of the simulation parameters for determining the energetics of the underlying phase transitions and the charge storage mechanisms. According to the present model, two linear regression lines can be established from relatively simple voltammetry experiments for characterizing energy storage materials: 1) The regression line of the CV mid-peak potential vs. Log of ion activity (or pH), in which the slope and the intercept provide information on the type of charge-carrier ions and their solvation state, respectively. 2) The regression line of the capacity vs. the inverse of the square root of scan rate, where the slope and intercept indicate the contributions of bulk and surface charges in thin redox films, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Dichtl, Thorsten Schuhmacher, Markus Lippitz</p>
            <p>Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</p>

Houck</p>
            <p>Materials improvements are a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits because such improvements can be readily translated to large scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by utilizing tantalum (Ta) as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve major improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon (Si) dramatically decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Q) exceeding 1.5 x 10^7, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 x 10^7, corresponding to a lifetime (T_1) of up to 1.68 ms. This low loss allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T_2E) exceeding T_1. We achieve these material improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.</p>

We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</p>

            <h2>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</h2>

            <p>We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</p>

            <p>Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</p>

Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.</p>

Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</p>

            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</p>

            <p>The scalability and power of quantum computing architectures depend critically on high-fidelity operations and robust and flexible qubit connectivity. In this respect, mobile qubits are particularly attractive as they enable dynamic and reconfigurable qubit arrays. This approach allows quantum processors to adapt their connectivity patterns during operation, implement different quantum error correction codes on the same hardware, and optimize resource utilization through dedicated functional zones for specific operations like measurement or entanglement generation. Such flexibility also relieves architectural constraints, as recently demonstrated in atomic systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms manipulated with optical tweezers. In solid-state platforms, highly coherent shuttling of electron spins was recently reported. A key outstanding question is whether it may be possible to perform quantum gates directly on the mobile spins. In this work, we demonstrate two-qubit operations between two electron spins carried towards each other in separate traveling potential minima in a semiconductor device. We find that the interaction strength is highly tunable by their spatial separation, achieving an average two-qubit gate fidelity of about 99\%. Additionally, we implement conditional post-selected quantum state teleportation between spatially separated qubits with an average gate fidelity of 87\%, showcasing the potential of mobile spin qubits for non-local quantum information processing. We expect that operations on mobile qubits will become a universal feature of future large-scale semiconductor quantum processors.</p>

This method leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.</p>

            <p>We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ansätze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</p>

            <h2>Natural Quantization of Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Barney, Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.</p>

            <h2>Emergent coding phases and hardware-tailored quantum codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Gyawali, Henry Shackleton, Zhu-Xi Luo, Michael Lawler</p>
            <p>Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and determining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The threshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a coding and a no-coding \emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error correction, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal code that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system experiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal code, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical mechanics, \emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this perspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum circuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization, we find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$ code'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase with first-order transitions between them and a novel \emph{zero capacity multi-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we provide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the optimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the multi-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions. Carrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic way to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</p>

            <h2>Intermediate statistics: addressing the Landau diamagnetism problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andre A. Marinho, Francisco A. Brito, G.M. Viswanathan, C. G. Bezerra</p>
            <p>Quantum groups and quantum algebras have received considerable attention in the last decades because they are very useful as mathematical tools of research. Existing proposals for quantum groups have always suggested the idea of deforming a classical object. Motivated by the possibility of anyons in three dimensions ($d=3$), with important consequences to a wide range of fields of physics, in the present work we investigate how the magnetization and other thermodynamic quantities, associated to the Landau diamagnetism problem, depend on the deforming parameter of two models with intermediate statistics: (i) $q$-fermions and (ii) $F$-anyons, and make {\it comparisons between both cases}. In particular, we extend the results from the literature for $q$-fermions by considering {\it second order terms} in the expansion of the grand partition function. Also, we find that for $F$-anyons statistics the magnetization shows a stronger response with respect to magnetic fields compared to magnetization for $q$-fermions statistics. This theoretical outcome may be experimentally verified for instance in superconductors, that are perfect diamagnetic materials with strong magnetic susceptibility, by adjusting impurities or pressure. The latter can be associated to the deforming parameter $q$.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry- and Energy-Resolved Entanglement Dynamics in Disordered Bose-Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</p>
            <p>Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium effects in ballistic point contacts Ta-Cu and 2H-NbSe2-Cu. Two-gap superconductivity in 2H-NbSe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.L. Bobrov</p>
            <p>Ta-Cu and NbSe2-Cu heterocontacts have been studied. For Ta-Cu contacts, a theoretical estimation of the delta-functional barrier at the boundary, arising due to the mismatch of the Fermi parameters of the contacting metals, has been carried out, and good agreement between the calculation and experiment has been obtained. An expression for estimating the diameter of the heterocontact on both sides of the boundary is obtained. The value of the jump-like reduction of the excess current (and superconducting gap) associated with the phase transition of the superconducting region near the point contact to a spatially inhomogeneous state when the critical concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles is reached is determined. The dependence of the additive differential resistance on the displacement at the contact arising after the phase transition due to the excess charge of quasiparticles and the associated reverse current (or additive voltage) is obtained. In 2H-NbSe2, a two-zone superconductivity character with an 8-fold difference in the energy gap values takes place. Under the action of current injection of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, there is a sequential phase transition of layers adjacent to the point contact into a spatially inhomogeneous state with a suppressed gap, which is accompanied by a stepwise change in the slope of the I-V curve with a discrete increase in the differential resistance.</p>

            <h2>Exact solutions and Dynamical phase transitions in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with Dual nonlinear interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongyang Yu</p>
            <p>Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics in a variety of disciplines. The generic LMG model usually incorporates two nonlinear interactions. While the classical dynamics of the single-nonlinear-inteaction LMG model is well understood through Jacobi elliptic functions, the dualinteraction case remains unexplored due to analytical challenges. Here, by constructing an auxiliary function that maps the dynamics to the complex plane of Jacobi elliptic functions, we derive exact solutions of classical dynamics for the dual-interaction LMG model. Based on the exact solutions, we give the classical dynamical phase diagram of the LMG model with dual nonlinear interactions, and find out a non-logarithmic behavior of dynamical criticality which is absent in case of single nonlinear interaction. Our results establish a benchmark to analyze the quantum dynamical phase transitions and many-body entanglement dynamics of finite-size LMG model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isidora Araya Day, Kostas Vilkelis, Antonio L. R. Manesco, A. Mert Bozkurt, Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent Josephson junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three junctions meet. The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccessible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.</p>

            <h2>The Uhlmann Phase Winding in Bose-Einstein Condensates at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-Yan Wang, Yan He</p>
            <p>We investigate the Uhlmann phase, a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite temperature. The Uhlmann phase characterizes topological properties of mixed states, in contrast to the Berry phase which is defined for pure states at zero temperature. Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general formula for the Uhlmann phase of BECs. Numerical calculations reveal that the Uhlmann phase can differ from the Berry phase in the zero-temperature limit, contrary to previous studies. As the temperature increases, the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior, and we relate the total winding degree to the Berry phase. This winding indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values on a Riemann surface. Furthermore, we propose an experimental scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of BECs by purifying the density matrix using an atomic interferometer.</p>

            <p>Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS), involving a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical data as well as experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], and show that the information from a second measurement basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</h2>

            <p>We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.</p>

In this context, control and readout of individual spin qubits have been shown on devices manufactured on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, which forms the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of $10$. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubits unit cell while providing high gain. We achieve a $74\%$ singlet-triplet readout fidelity in $8~\mu$s integration time, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration on a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards the large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</p>

Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement.

            <h2>Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kruti, Roman-Pascal Riwar</p>
            <p>Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</p>

            <p>We explore the ground states and quench dynamics of one-dimensional quantum droplets with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an imbalance in intracomponent interactions. A plethora of miscible ground state stripe and standard (i.e., non-modulated) droplets is found depending on the SOC wavenumber and building upon Gaussian to flat-top background for increasing (decreasing) atom number (interactions). Deformations among the states were accompanied by spin population transfer caused by the Rabi coupling and could be controlled by adjusting the interactions or the SOC parameters. When considering a trap, we identified a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state, characterized by a sign change of the chemical potential, which occurred at lower (larger) atom numbers for tighter traps (stronger interactions). The droplet's breathing motion was accompanied by minor population transfer, and its frequency increases for a larger intracomponent interaction ratio or reaching a maximum at SOC wavenumbers, where the transition from non-modulated flat-top to stripe droplets occurred. We witness droplet fragmentation for abrupt changes in the Rabi coupling while large amplitude quenches of the SOC wavenumber trigger spin-demixing, resulting in constant amplitude but opposite direction motion of untrapped droplets or in-trap out-of-phase oscillating droplets. Our findings have implications for controlled spin-demixing processes of droplets and the excitation of relevant magnetic bound states.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties, CDW states, and their response to strain in monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can increase the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results, validating our computational approach. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. To calculate $J_{ij}$ from first principles, perturbative methods based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT), commonly referred to as Liechtenstein's method, have been widely employed. However, the quantitative accuracy of $J_{ij}$ obtained through this perturbative technique remains uncertain. In this paper, we nonperturbatively calculate $J_{ij}$ for several systems of both fundamental and applied significance, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare these results with those obtained using the conventional MFT-based method. The nonperturbative approach provides consistent results for magnetic configurations exhibiting a certain degree of magnetic disorder. In contrast, due to its inherent theoretical limitations, the MFT-based method struggles to accurately evaluate the magnetic energy in such configurations. As discussed later in this paper, these discrepancies arise from neglected contributions within MFT-based methods. Our nonperturbative scheme is highly versatile and holds strong prospects as a new platform for analyzing and designing spintronic materials, where developing accurate spin models is essential.</p>

            <p>In crystalline materials, low lattice thermal conductivity is often associated with strong anharmonicity, which can cause significant deviations from the expected Lorentzian lineshape of phonon spectral functions. These deviations, occurring in an overdamped regime, raise questions about the applicability of the Boltzmann transport equation. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can trigger structural phase transitions with temperature, which cannot be adequately described by the standard harmonic approximation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for computing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our method combines the Green-Kubo linear response theory with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The latter allows us to describe the temperature-dependent evolution of the crystal structure, including first- and second-order phase transitions, as well as the vibrational properties in highly anharmonic materials. The Green-Kubo method considers the entire lineshapes of phonon spectral functions in the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity, thus eliminating the questionable use of phonon lifetimes in the overdamped regime, as well as naturally including coherent transport effects. Additionally, we extend our theory to model complex dynamical lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing our understanding of time-dependent thermoreflectance experiments. As a practical application, we employ this approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$, a complex crystal known for its anomalous thermal transport behavior with a complex phase diagram. Our method is able to determine the thermal conductivity across different phases in good agreement with experiments.</p>

            <h2>Weak Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets from Alternating $g$-Tensor Anisotropy</h2>

            <p>Altermagnets are magnetic materials with antiferromagnetic spin ordering but exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Understanding the microscopic origin of the latter is a central problem. Ferromagnet-like properties such as the anomalous Hall effect are linked with weak ferromagnetism, whose microscopic origin in altermagnets remains unclear however. We show theoretically that the alternating $g$-tensor anisotropy in altermagnets can induce weak ferromagnetism even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is forbidden. We demonstrate this mechanism to explain weak ferromagnetism for both collinear and noncollinear spin altermagnets. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of weak ferromagnetism and suggest orbital-based ways for manipulating magnetic configurations in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Fisher Information (FI) is a quantity ubiquitously measured in such varied areas like metrology, machine learning, and biological complexity. Mathematically, it represents a lower bound in the variance of unknown parameters that are related to the distributions one has access, and a metric for probability manifolds. A stochastic analogous of the Fisher Information, dubbed stochastic Fisher Information was recently introduced in the literature by some of us. By exploring the probability distributions of the Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length in entropy space derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the SFI with time as a parameter. Finally, we test our geometric fluctuation relations using two nonequilibrium models.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric (Fe) materials-based devices show great promise for non-volatile memory applications, yet few demonstrate reliable operation at elevated temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor capacitors for high-temperature non-volatile memory applications. Our 30-nm thick ferroelectric Al0.68Sc0.32N film grown on SiC exhibits stable and robust ferroelectric switching up to 1000°C. The coercive field decreases linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800°C, further reducing to -2.5 MV cm-1 at 1000°C. At 600°C, the devices achieve remarkable reliability with ~2000 endurance cycles and over at least 100 hours of retention with negligible polarization loss. At 800°C, the devices retain data for at least 10,000 seconds and exceed 400 write cycles. Our results further highlight the potential for ferroelectric AlScN thin-films particularly when paired with SiC semiconductor substrates for high-temperature non-volatile memory.</p>

            <p>Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</p>

Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Tang, Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Wanzhou Zhang, Chengxiang Ding</p>
            <p>Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hu Xu, Frederic Marazzato, Paul Plucinsky</p>
            <p>Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker</p>
            <p>The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular scale. DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale. Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.</p>

            <p>MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</p>

            <p>Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nosé-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</p>

            <p>When can we map a classical density profile to an external potential? In equilibrium, without time dependence, the one-body density is known to specify the external potential that is applied to the many-body system. This mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we consider non-equilibrium, time-dependent many-body systems that evolve from a given initial condition. We derive explicit conditions, for example, no flux at the boundary, that ensure that the mapping from the density to a time-dependent external potential is unique. We thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), without resorting to the so-called adiabatic approximation often used in applications. By ascertaining uniqueness for all $n$-body densities, we ensure that the proof and the physical conclusions drawn from it hold for general superadiabatic dynamics of interacting systems even in the presence of (known) non-conservative forces.</p>

            <p>Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22~mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.</p>

We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</p>

We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point.

            <p>The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p>

            <p>The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N < 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</p>

In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated "Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.</p>

            <h2>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Giral Martínez</p>
            <p>Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</p>

            <p>These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Ozawa, Henning Schomerus</p>
            <p>Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</p>

            <h2>Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy: multi-reference random phase approximation via diagrammatic resummation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li</p>
            <p>Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based on Green's functions and Feynman diagrams provides a fundamental theoretical framework for various \emph{ab initio} computational approaches in molecular and materials science, including the random phase approximation (RPA) and $GW$ approximation. Unfortunately, this perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference characters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly nontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of Wick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly correlated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's function in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively formulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work. Our formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation effects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions through a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a concrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the standard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring diagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to both SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems reveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in strongly correlated systems. This theoretical advancement paves the way for advancing \emph{ab initio} computational methods through diagrammatic resummation techniques in future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daria Tieplova, Samriddha Lahiry, Jean Barbier</p>
            <p>High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaan Pakala, Dawon Ahn, Evangelos Papalexakis</p>
            <p>When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</p>

            <p>This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</p>

            <p>We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in TMD-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Cooperativity on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Light-induced Spin-State Switching of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ Spin-Crossover Complex</h2>

            <p>Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes. In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.</p>

By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</p>

The RCD signal originates from contributions of Berry curvature and quantum metric. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to two examples - the Kitaev honeycomb model in a magnetic field and a chiral $U(1)$ QSL on the triangular lattice - and discuss its experimental relevance for candidate materials.</p>

            <p>The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC has attracted significant research attention owing to its remarkable spin and optical properties at ambient temperatures. Unlike many color centers that require cryogenic conditions to function, the PL6 center maintains optical activity even at room temperature or higher, benefiting from the material's high thermal conductivity and chemical stability. To elucidate the origin of PL6's distinctive characteristics and clarify its microscopic structure in the crystal, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of potential defect complexes through systematic first-principles calculations. Our computational approach rigorously evaluates the electronic structures and spin-related properties of various defect configurations, enabling reasonable identification of the most probable atomic arrangement responsible for the observed characteristics of PL6. Our analysis identifies a limited set of candidate structures with ${\rm C_{3v}}$-like symmetry consistent with known experimental signatures. Among these, two defect complexes emerge as the most likely PL6 candidates. The findings suggest that targeted experimental studies, such as electron spin resonance and optically detected magnetic resonance, could further clarify the nature of the PL6 center, while additional theoretical investigations on transition matrix elements and defect formation dynamics are warranted.</p>

            <p>Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</p>

For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.</p>

This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junctions array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junctions central weak link area.</p>

            <p>Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary Rényi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Bothe, Eloise Lardet, Alexei Poliakov, Gunnar Pruessner, Thibault Bertrand, Ignacio Bordeu</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.</p>

            <h2>Engineering anisotropic Dicke model with dipole-dipole interaction for Rydberg atom arrays in cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao-Yun Dong, Yanhua Zhou, Wei Wang, Tao Wang</p>
            <p>The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhou Xu, Antoine Maillard, Lenka Zdeborová, Florent Krzakala</p>
            <p>In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</p>

            <p>The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</p>

            <p>Chiral superconductivity exhibits the formation of novel electron pairs that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and has been actively studied in various quantum materials in recent years. However, despite its potential to provide definitive information, effects of disorder in the crystal structure on the chiral superconductivity has not yet been clarified, and therefore the investigation using a solid-solution system is desirable. We report muon-spin-relaxation (muSR) results of layered pnictide BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with a honeycomb network composed of Pt and (As, Sb). We observed an increase of the zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate in the superconducting (SC) state at the Sb end of x=1.0, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic field due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the SC state. On the other hand, spontaneous magnetic field was almost and completely suppressed for the As-Sb mixed samples of x=0.9 and 0.2, respectively, suggesting that the time-reversal symmetry breaking SC state in x=1.0 is sensitive to disorder. The magnetic penetration depth estimated from transverse-field muSR measurements at x=1.0 and 0.2 behaved like weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. These seemingly incompatible zero-field and transverse-field muSR results of BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with x=1.0 could be understood in terms of chiral d-wave superconductivity with point nodes on the three-dimensional Fermi surface.</p>

This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism.

Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gökmen Polat, Eric Jeckelmann (Institute of Theoretical Physics, Leibniz Universität Hannover)</p>
            <p>We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</p>

            <p>A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre A. Pantaleon, Zhen Zhan, Siddhartha E. Morales, Gerardo G. Naumis</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial band topology. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial band topology and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</p>

            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. We theoretically prove the topological behavior and phase transition of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Also, Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term $(C_s=1$ and $C_v=0)$, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of non-trivial and trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Laura Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Munch, Barbara Wagner</p>
            <p>We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</p>

            <p>Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.</p>

            <p>Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.</p>

            <p>Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</p>

Our approach is adequate for a digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filling two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In such example we obtain fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable to study the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems.

            <p>The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings.

An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</p>

            <p>Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</p>

            <p>A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wai-Keong Mok, Tobias Haug, Adam L. Shaw, Manuel Endres, John Preskill</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</p>

These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity.

The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

            <h2>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahnaz Farhat, Denis Périce, Sören Petrat</p>
            <p>The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruna G. M. Araújo, Antonio M S Macedo</p>
            <p>Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hall effect in a chiral cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Yang, Gabriel Cardoso, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</p>

            <h2>Effective Conformal Field Theory generated from Pure and Dephased Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijat Sarma, Yimu Bao, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Thomas Kiely, Cenke Xu</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Accurate Structural Relaxation and Emergent Polarization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wilson Nieto Luna, Robin Smeyers, Cem Sevik, Lucian Covaci, Milorad V. Milošević</p>
            <p>The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moiré bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.</p>

            <h2>Anthraphenylenes: Porous 2D Carbon Monolayers with Biphenyl-Anthracene Frameworks and Type-II Dirac line nodes</h2>

            <p>Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications. By expanding the family of 2D carbon materials, anthraphenylenes provide new avenues for functional nanomaterial design.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have attracted considerable interest due to their diverse structural and electronic properties, making them ideal for next-generation flat electronics. Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. These findings establish beta-naphthyne as a promising material for energy storage and optoelectronic technologies.</p>
