            <h2>Comments on "Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors", arxiv:2409.16758</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Goyal, Rohit Kumar, Armando Galluzzi, Massimiliano Polichetti</p>
            <p>We provide comments on article "Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors" by Talantsev and Tallon, arXiv:2409.16758 and this https URL related to the predictions of the key equation proposed in article "Universal self-field critical current for thin-film superconductors," by Talantsev and Tallon, Nat. Commun. 6 (2015) 7820. We respond to claims and assertions made in these articles and also show that the so-called "Universal self-field critical current" and the "fundamental limit" for self-field Jc suggested by Talantsev and Tallon, has been proven incorrect experimentally and this invalidates the key claims and findings stated in both these articles.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-mediated quantum coherence of $W^{5+}$ spins in an oxygen-deficient double perovskite</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shannon Bernier, Danna E. Freedman, Tyrel M. McQueen, Paul Oyala, Tyler J. Pearson, W. Adam Phelan, Maxime A. Siegler, Mekhola Sinha, Peter V. Sushko</p>
            <p>Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at T ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ over previously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.</p>

            <h2>Revealing the anisotropic charge-density-wave order of TiSe$_2$ through high harmonic generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Zhang, Igor Tyulnev, Lenard Vamos, Julita Poborska, Utso Bhattacharya, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Tobias Grass, Jens Biegert, Maciej Lewenstein</p>
            <p>Titanium diselenide (TiSe$_{2}$) is a transition-metal dichalcogenide material that undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at $T_{c}\approx 200\,\mathrm{K}$. In a recent experiment [I. Tyulnev et al., arXiv:2409.04216], the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of this material has been studied, which exhibits asymmetric behavior with respect to the polarization angle of the incident light and provides a new perspective to the CDW phase transition. In this work, we work out a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed behavior of HHG spectra. We propose a simplified phenomenological mean-field model for this material, based on which the HHG spectra is calculated through the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This model correctly describes the measured intensity distribution of the third-, fifth-, and seventh-order harmonic generation as a function of polarization direction and reveals a strong asymmetry due to the anisotropic CDW order in the low temperature phase. Our work provides a basis for applying high harmonic spectroscopy to reveal a new perspective on the nature of CDW orders.</p>

            <h2>Harmonic-Induced Plasmonic Resonant Energy Transfer between Metal and Semiconductor Nanoparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueming Yan, Nathan J. Spear, Adam J. Cummings, Karina Khusainova, Janet E. Macdonald, Richard F. Haglund</p>
            <p>Heterostructures combining two or more metal and/or semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit enhanced upconversion arising from localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). However, coupled plasmon-exciton systems are slowed by excitonic relaxation and metallic multi-plasmon systems are not broadly tunable. Here, we describe a heterostructure in which insulating alumina layers vary separation between CuS and Au nanoparticles, allowing experimental confirmation of the d^(-6) dependence typical of surface-dipole mediated interactions between Au and CuS plasmons, as demonstrated in Lumerical simulations. Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster plasmon relaxation in heterostructured Au/CuS (690 fs) than CuS nanoparticles (929 fs), signifying direct energy transfer. Moreover, coupling between the second-harmonic LSPRs of CuS and the fundamental LSPR in Au is evident in nonlinear absorption measurement. This defines a novel harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer (HIPRET) dynamic linking the metallic Au plasmon and the broad semiconductor plasmon in CuS. This prototype for tunable, ultrafast plasmonic upconversion exemplifies a strategy for high-efficiency nonlinear nanodevices that have promising applications in photocatalysis, parametric down-conversion and biomedical imaging.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Simulations of Coupled Electron and Phonon Nonequilibrium Dynamics Using Adaptive and Multirate Time Integration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Yao, Ivan Maliyov, David J. Gardner, Carol S. Woodward, Marco Bernardi</p>
            <p>Electronic structure calculations in the time domain provide a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. The real-time Boltzmann equation (rt-BTE), used in conjunction with accurate interactions computed from first principles, has enabled reliable predictions of coupled electron and lattice dynamics. However, the timescales and system sizes accessible with this approach are still limited, with two main challenges being the different timescales of electron and phonon interactions and the cost of computing collision integrals. As a result, only a few examples of these calculations exist, mainly for two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we leverage adaptive and multirate time integration methods to achieve a major step forward in solving the coupled rt-BTEs for electrons and phonons. Relative to conventional (non-adaptive) time-stepping, our approach achieves a 10x speedup for a given target accuracy, or greater accuracy by 3-6 orders of magnitude for the same computational cost, enabling efficient calculations in both 2D and bulk materials. This efficiency is showcased by computing the coupled electron and lattice dynamics in graphene up to $\sim$100 ps, as well as modeling ultrafast lattice dynamics and thermal diffuse scattering maps in a bulk material (silicon). These results open new opportunities for quantitative studies of nonequilibrium physics in materials.</p>

            <h2>Electromagnetic evanescent field associated with surface acoustic wave: Response of metallic thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Kawada, Kei Yamamoto, Masashi Kawaguchi, Hiroki Matsumoto, Ryusuke Hisatomi, Hiroshi Kohno, Sadamichi Maekawa, Masamitsu Hayashi</p>
            <p>Surface acoustic waves (SAWs), coherent vibrational modes localized at solid surfaces, have been employed to manipulate and detect electronic and magnetic states in condensed-matter systems via strain. SAWs are commonly excited in a piezoelectric material, often the substrate. In such systems, SAWs not only generate strain but also electric field at the surface. Conventional analysis of the electric field accompanying the SAW invokes the electrostatic approximation, which may fall short in fully capturing its essential characteristics by neglecting the effect of the magnetic field. Here we study the electric and magnetic fields associated with SAWs without introducing the electrostatic approximation. The plane wave solution takes the form of an evanescent field that decays along the surface normal with a phase velocity equal to the speed of sound. If a metallic film is placed on the piezoelectric substrate, a time- and space-varying electric field permeates into the film with a decay length along the film normal defined by the skin depth and the SAW wavelength. For films with high conductivity, the phase of the electric field varies along the film normal. The emergence of the evanescent field is a direct consequence of dropping the electrostatic approximation, providing a simple but critical physical interpretation of the SAW-induced electromagnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic Dark Excitonic Mott Insulator in the Breathing-Kagome Lattice Material Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahtab Khan, Naseem Ud Din, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands (FBs) in breathing Kagome lattices (BKLs), we present a detailed first-principles study of the optical response of single-layer (SL) Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ using the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method, incorporating self-energy corrections and excitonic effects. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of strongly bound excitons. The key results are fourfold: (i) SL Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ exhibits a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton ground state with binding energy substantially larger than the GW-renormalized band gap, giving rise to a negative exciton energy peak at $-0.14$ eV and indicating an excitonic Mott insulator phase potentially stable at room temperature ($k_B T = 0.025$ eV); (ii) the brightest exciton peak appears at 1.2 eV, in excellent agreement with experimental optical absorption spectra. (iii) We map the low-energy Frenkel exciton system onto a Hubbard model with spin-1 particles on a triangular lattice, resulting in frustrated spin configurations due to antiferromagnetic spin-spin exchange interaction. (iv) As the spin-triplet Frenkel excitons have electric dipoles that interact with each other via electric dipole-dipole interaction, we obtain antiferroelectric ordering, possibly stable at room temperature. Thus, we propose that Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ is a multiferroic dark spin-triplet excitonic Mott insulator.</p>

            <h2>A spinless spin qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Valentin John, Barnaby van Straaten, Stefano Bosco</p>
            <p>All-electrical baseband control of qubits facilitates scaling up quantum processors by removing issues of crosstalk and heat generation. In semiconductor quantum dots, this is enabled by multi-spin qubit encodings, such as the exchange-only qubit, where high-fidelity readout and both single- and two-qubit operations have been demonstrated. However, their performance is limited by unavoidable leakage states that are energetically close to the computational subspace. In this work, we introduce an alternative, scalable spin qubit architecture that leverages strong spin-orbit interactions of hole nanostructures for baseband qubit operations while completely eliminating leakage channels and reducing the overall gate overhead. This encoding is intrinsically robust to local variability in hole spin properties and operates with two degenerate states, removing the need for precise calibration and mitigating heat generation from fast signal sources. Finally, our architecture is fully compatible with current technology, utilizing the same initialization, readout, and multi-qubit protocols of state-of-the-art spin-1/2 systems. By addressing critical scalability challenges, our design offers a robust and scalable pathway for semiconductor spin qubit technologies.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast Coulomb blockade in an atomic-scale quantum dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Allerbeck, Laric Bobzien, Nils Krane, S. Eve Ammerman, Daniel E. Cintron Figueroa, Chengye Dong, Joshua A. Robinson, Bruno Schuler</p>
            <p>Controlling electron dynamics at optical clock rates is a fundamental challenge in lightwave-driven nanoelectronics. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast charge-state manipulation of individual selenium vacancies in monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using picosecond terahertz (THz) source pulses, focused onto the picocavity of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using THz pump--THz probe time-domain sampling of the defect charge population, we capture atomic-scale snapshots of the transient Coulomb blockade, a signature of charge transport via quantized defect states. We identify back tunneling of localized charges to the tip electrode as a key challenge for lightwave-driven STM when probing electronic states with charge-state lifetimes exceeding the pulse duration. However, we show that back tunneling can be mitigated by the Franck-Condon blockade, which limits accessible vibronic transitions and promotes unidirectional charge transport. Our rate equation model accurately reproduces the time-dependent tunneling process across the different coupling regimes. This work builds on recent progress in imaging coherent lattice and quasiparticle dynamics with lightwave-driven STM and opens new avenues for exploring ultrafast charge dynamics in low-dimensional materials, advancing the development of lightwave-driven nanoscale electronics.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima</p>
            <p>We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</p>

            <h2>Transport theory and spin-transfer physics in d-wave altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Zarzuela, Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Olena Gomonay, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova</p>
            <p>We develop a mesoscale transport theory for the charge and spin degrees of freedom of itinerant carriers in a $d$-wave altermagnet. Our effective Lagrangian description is built upon the slave-boson formulation of the microscopic $t-J$ model. We obtain a spin-polarized diffusive contribution to the effective Hamiltonian, with no counterpart in conventional antiferromagnetism and parametrized by the spin splitting, that is responsible for the so-called spin-splitter effect in $d$-wave altermagnets. We also elucidate the spin-transfer response of the itinerant fluid as well as the spin pumping into the altermagnet, which show previously unidentified combinations of the charge current and spatial partial derivatives (namely, {$j_{x}^{e}$,$\partial_{y}$} and {$j_{y}^{e}$,$\partial_{x}$}). The emergent spin-transfer physics in $d$-wave altermagnets opens up new possibilities for the dynamics of spin textures, such as the domain-wall motion driven by transverse charge currents. We also consider the effect of elastic distortions in the aforementioned transport properties.</p>

            <h2>Coulomb Drag in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Jie Lin, Song-Bo Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>Altermagnet is a newly discovered antiferromagnet, characterized by unique anisotropic spin-split energy bands. It has attracted tremendous interest, because of its promising potential in information storage and processing. However, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from altermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag to probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active layer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated passive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb drag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in the passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit coupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More importantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence, which can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for altermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessia Gentili, Rainer Klages, Giorgio Volpe</p>
            <p>From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with Lévy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</p>

            <h2>Linear response of tilted anisotropic two-dimensional Dirac cones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$.</p>

            <h2>Correlated interaction effects in an anisotropic flat band fermion system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Rong Wang, Chang-Jin Zhang</p>
            <p>An anisotropic flat band fermion system with a novel dispersion that is linear along one direction and cubic along another is proposed in Phys. Rev. X. 13, 021012 (2023). We study the effects of Coulomb interaction in this fermion system by renormalization group theory and Dyson-Schwinger gap equation. We perform renormalizaton group analysis and find that fermion velocity is always restored along the direction that the fermions take cubic dispersion originally. Accordingly, the system takes the similar behaviors to the two-dimensional Dirac fermion system with Coulomb interaction in the low energy regime. Based on Dyson-Schwinger gap equation method, we find that an excitonic gap is generated if the Coulomb strength is large enough, and the system becomes a novel excitonic Chern insulator with quantized anomalous Hall conductivity. Observable quantities of this system in free case, under weak and strong enough Coulomb interaction are all analyzed.</p>

            <p>Gallium oxide is a novel advanced material gaining increasing attention for its unique combination of functional properties. It forms in several phases or polymorphs - {\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, and {\kappa} - having variable properties because of different lattice symmetries. Optical properties are of particular importance as they determine specific device applications and can also be used for phase identification. However, a direct comparison of optical polymorph signatures, including such critical parameters as bandgaps, is challenging due to the scattered, limited, or even absent data for certain phases in the literature. To address this issue, in the present work we systematically cross-correlate optical emission and absorption features of {\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, and {\kappa} thin films, as well as differently oriented {\beta}-phase bulk crystals and {\gamma}/{\beta} double polymorph structures. We demonstrate that the optical bandgap and emission features scale consistently across these polymorphs upon minimization of the methodological uncertainties. As a result, this work provides a comparative library of near- and far-field optical signatures of the polymorphs for use by the multidisciplinary research community working with gallium oxide.</p>

            <p>One of the challenges in diagrammatic simulations of nonequilibrium phenomena in lattice models is the large memory demand for storing momentum-dependent two-time correlation functions. This problem can be overcome with the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) representation of multivariable functions. Here, we demonstrate nonequilibrium $GW$ simulations with high momentum resolution, up to times which exceed the capabilities of standard implementations and are long enough to study, e.g., thermalization dynamics and transient Floquet physics during multi-cycle electric field pulses. The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour employs only QTT-compressed functions, and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form, or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin textures with rich physics and great potential for unconventional computing. Typically, skyrmions form in bulk crystals with reduced symmetry or ultrathin film multilayers involving heavy metals. Here, we demonstrate the formation of fractional Bloch skyrmion tubes at room temperature by 3D printing ferromagnetic double-helix nanowires with two regions of opposite chirality. Using X-ray microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the coexistence of vortex and anti-parallel spin states induces the formation of fractional skyrmion tubes at zero magnetic fields, minimising the energy cost of breaking the coupling between geometric and magnetic chirality. We also demonstrate control over zero-field states, including pure vortex, or mixed skyrmion-vortex states, highlighting the magnetic reconfigurability of these 3D nanowires. This work shows how interfacing chiral geometries at the nanoscale can enable advanced forms of topological spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumanta Bhandary, Emiliano Poli, Gilberto Teobaldi, David D. O'Regan</p>
            <p>Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.</p>

            <p>We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the Néel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the Néel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the Néel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties. Our work provides critical insights into the fundamental interactions governing hybrid spin systems and opens new avenues for the design of versatile, temperature-responsive magnetoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Monolayer Capping Provides Close to Optimal Resistance to Laser Dewetting of Au Films</h2>

            <p>Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.</p>

            <h2>Henry constant of helium in liquid lead-lithium alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edgar Alvarez-Galera, Daniel Laria, Ferran Mazzanti, Lluis Batet, Jordi Marti</p>
            <p>The solubility of helium in liquid metals is a knowledge of fundamental importance in the design of the future nuclear fusion reactors, since the formation of helium bubbles inside the breeding blankets of the reactors can be a threat to the durability of the devices and, more importantly, to the efficiency of tritium recovery. In the present work we report a detailed set of calculations of the solubility of helium in lead and lead-lithium alloys. A series of molecular dynamics simulations have been combined with a classical perturbative procedure able to compute the free energy of insertion of a helium atom inside a liquid metal bath, directly related to the solubility of helium. As the most important case, the concentration of the eutectic solution has been explored in full detail. We have found that solubility of helium in pure lithium is lower than in pure lead, predicting a value at the eutectic state (16% Li-84% Pb at 508 K) of about $5 \times 10^{-16}$ Pa$^{-1}$. The observed trend indicates that solubilties rise with increasing temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneous SU(2) symmetries in homogeneous integrable U(1) circuits and transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marko Znidaric</p>
            <p>We study symmetries of quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates discovering new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$ symmetries. Despite the model being homogeneous -- all gates are the same -- symmetry generators are not. Rather, they exhibit an even-odd staggering and a nonzero quasi-momentum, and depend on gate parameters. Such parameter-dependent symmetries can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved truncated propagator. They can be thought of as a generalization of the standard SU(2) symmetry of the XXZ model that uppon introducing the staggered field splits into a local SU(2) symmetry and a non-local ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$. Picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases: fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold including superdiffusive helix states, and diffusion within which there is also localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</p>

            <p>Renewable and biodegradable plastics derived from soy protein isolate (SPI) offer a promising alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics, particularly for film-grade bioplastics applications such as plastic bags. However, even with reinforcement from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), their mechanical properties including stiffness lag behind those of petroleum-based plastics. To identify pathways for improving CNC-reinforced SPI composites, we studied stiffening mechanisms by interpreting experimental data using homogenization models that accounted for CNC agglomeration and the formation of CNC/SPI interphases. To model effects of surface modification of CNCs with polydopamine (polyDOPA), we incorporated two key mechanisms: enhanced CNC dispersion and modified CNC-SPI interfacial interactions. Models accounted for interphases surrounding CNCs, arising from physicochemical interactions with the polyDOPA-modified CNC surfaces. Consistent wih experimental observations of polyDOPA modification enhancing mechanical properties through both increased spatial distribution of CNCs and matrix-filler interactions, results demonstrated that improved dispersion and interfacial bonding contribute to increased composite stiffness. Results highlight the potential of biodegradable CNC/SPI bio-nanocomposites as sustainable plastic alternatives, and suggest pathways for further enhancing their mechanical properties.</p>

Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Davemaoite, as the third most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, constitutes significant amounts in pyrolite and mid-ocean ridge basalts. Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now.</p>

            <p>Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern quantum science experiments. Cutting edge quantum science can be performed with atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and optically trapped. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we confine indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</p>

            <p>Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Habib Ammari, Jinghao Cao, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Liora Rueff</p>
            <p>This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of integro-differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</p>

            <p>In the search for accurate approximate solutions of the many-body Schrödinger equation, reduced density matrices play an important role, as they allow to formulate approximate methods with polynomial scaling in the number of particles. However, these methods frequently encounter the issue of $N$-representability, whereby in self-consistent applications of the methods, the reduced density matrices become unphysical. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the past to restore a given set of $N$-representability conditions once the reduced density matrices become defective. However, these purification algorithms have either ignored symmetries of the Hamiltonian related to conserved quantities, or have not incorporated them in an efficient way, thereby modifying the reduced density matrix to a greater extent than is necessary. In this paper, we present an algorithm capable of efficiently performing all of the following tasks in the least invasive manner: restoring a given set of $N$-representability conditions, maintaining contraction consistency between successive orders of reduced density matrices, and preserving all conserved quantities. We demonstrate the superiority of the present purification algorithm over previous ones in the context of the time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix method applied to the quench dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. While mathematically equivalent to the widely-used vectorization method, our method offers significant improvements in the numerical efficiency, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our method.</p>

            <p>Noise is often regarded as a limitation of quantum computers. In this work, we show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to strongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite system coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large number of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that harvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend of noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this approach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach longer time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This method would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.</p>

            <p>We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</p>

            <p>Transforming CO2 into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt3, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</p>

            <p>We map the decoding problem of the surface code under depolarizing and syndrome noise to a disordered spin model, which we call the random coupled-plaquette gauge model (RCPGM). By coupling X- and Z-syndrome volumes, this model allows us to optimally account for genuine Y-errors in the surface code in a setting with noisy measurements. Using Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the code's fundamental error threshold. Firstly, for the phenomenological noise setting we determine a threshold of $6\%$ under uniform depolarizing and syndrome noise. This is a substantial improvement compared to results obtained via the previously known "uncoupled" random plaquette gauge model (RPGM) in the identical setting, where marginalizing Y-errors leads to a threshold of $4.3\%$. Secondly, we tackle the circuit-level noise scenario, where we use a reduction technique to find effective asymmetric depolarizing and syndrome noise rates to feed into the RCPGM mapping. Despite this reduction technique breaking up some of the correlations contained in the intricacies of circuit-level noise, we find an improvement exceeding that for the phenomenological case. We report a threshold of up to $1.4\%$, to be compared to $0.7\%$ under the identical noise model when marginalizing the Y-errors and mapping to the anisotropic RPGM. These results enlarge the landscape of statistical mechanical mappings for quantum error correction. In particular they provide an underpinning for the broadly held belief that accounting for Y-errors is a major bottleneck in improving surface code decoders. This is highly encouraging for leading efficient practical decoder development, where heuristically accounting for Y-error correlations has seen recent developments such as belief-matching. This suggests that there is further room for improvement of the surface code for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.</p>

            <p>Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0<\alpha<d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0<\alpha<d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</p>

            <p>We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited circular phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. While the phonon Zeeman effect enables a theoretical description of phonon-induced magnetism, it lacks efficient angular momentum transfer from the phonon to the electron sector. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. First-principle simulations on SrTiO$_3$ demonstrate that in parts of the Brillouin zone, this splitting between orbitals carrying angular momentum can easily reach 50 meV.</p>

Furthermore, we show the model's compliance with Weber's Law of relative stimulus perception, aligning with previous analysis of collective decision problems. Our study also identifies non-equilibrium critical behavior in specific limits of the model, where the highest values of consensus are achieved. This result highlights the intriguing relationship between optimal performance, critically, and the fluctuations caused by finite size effects, often seen in biological systems. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively.</p>

            <h2>Accessing Semi-Addressable Self Assembly with Efficient Structure Enumeration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian C. Hübl, Carl P. Goodrich</p>
            <p>Modern experimental methods enable the creation of self-assembly building blocks with tunable interactions, but optimally exploiting this tunability for the self-assembly of desired structures remains an important challenge. Many studies of this inverse problem start with the so-called fully-addressable limit, where every particle in a target structure is different. This leads to clear design principles that often result in high assembly yield, but it is not a scaleable approach -- at some point, one must grapple with "reusing" building blocks, which lowers the degree of addressability and may cause a multitude of off-target structures to form, complicating the design process. Here, we solve a key obstacle preventing robust inverse design in the "semi-addressable regime" by developing a highly efficient algorithm that enumerates all structures that can be formed from a given set of building blocks. By combining this with established partition-function-based yield calculations, we show that it is almost always possible to find economical semi-addressable designs where the entropic gain from reusing building blocks outweighs the presence of off-target structures and even increases the yield of the target. Thus, not only does our enumeration algorithm enable robust and scalable inverse design in the semi-addressable regime, our results demonstrate that it is possible to operate in this regime while maintaining the level of control often associated with full addressability.</p>

            <h2>Local Time Statistics and Permeable Barrier Crossing: from Poisson to Birth-Death Diffusion Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toby Kay, Luca Giuggioli</p>
            <p>Barrier crossing is a widespread phenomenon across natural and engineering systems. While an abundant cross-disciplinary literature on the topic has emerged over the years, the stochastic underpinnings of the process are yet to be linked quantitatively to easily measurable observables. We bridge this gap by developing a microscopic representation of Brownian motion in the presence of permeable barriers that allows to treat barriers with constant asymmetric permeabilities. Our approach relies upon reflected Brownian motion and on the crossing events being Poisson processes subordinated by the local time of the underlying motion at the barrier. Within this paradigm we derive the exact expression for the distribution of the number of crossings, and find an experimentally measurable statistical definition of permeability. We employ Feynman-Kac theory to derive and solve a set of governing birth-death diffusion equations and extend them to the case when barrier permeability is constant and asymmetric. As an application we study a system of infinite, identical and periodically placed asymmetric barriers for which we derive analytically effective transport parameters. This periodic arrangement induces an effective drift at long times whose magnitude depends on the difference in the permeability on either side of the barrier as well as on their absolute values. As the asymmetric permeabilities act akin to localised 'ratchet' potentials that break spatial symmetry and detailed balance, the proposed arrangement of asymmetric barriers provides an example of a noise-induced drift without the need to time-modulate any external force or create temporal correlations on the motion of a diffusing particle. By placing only one asymmetric barrier in a periodic domain we also show the emergence of a non-equilibrium steady state.</p>

            <p>In this study, a novel material from the rare-earth based breathing pyrochlore family, Ba3Tm2Zn5O11, was successfully synthesized. Powder x-ray diffraction and high-resolution powder neutron diffraction confirmed phase purity and the F-43m breathing pyrochlore crystal structure, while thermogravimetric analysis revealed incongruent melting behavior compared to its counterpart, Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. High-quality single crystals of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and assessed using Laue x-ray diffraction and single crystal x-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct dispersionless crystal electric field energy bands, with the fitted crystal electric field model predicting a single-ion singlet ground state and an energy gap of ~9 meV separating it from the first excited (singlet) state. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV. Computed phonon dispersions from first-principles calculations ruled out phonons as the origin of these modes, further illustrating the puzzling and unique properties of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11.</p>

            <h2>Mechanics of elliptical JKR-type adhesive contact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Giudici, Dominic Vella, Ian Griffiths</p>
            <p>The classic Johnson Kendall Roberts (JKR) theory describes the short-ranged adhesive contact of elastic bodies, but is only valid for axisymmetric contact. A theory for non-axisymmetric contact, which relies on approximating the contact region as an ellipse, was proposed by Johnson and Greenwood (JG). The theory includes the effects of adhesion via Griffith's criterion applied only at the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contact ellipse. Although JG's work is in good agreement with numerical and experimental results for quasi-circular contacts, the agreement worsens as the eccentricity of the contact region increases. In this paper, we show that including the effects of adhesion by instead minimizing the sum of elastic and surface energy yields results that are in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations over the full range of contact eccentricities.</p>

            <p>The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM) and higher-order Weyl semimetal (HOWSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HOWSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both surface and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HOWSM (mHOWSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field. The mHOWSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both surface and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHOWSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in mHOWSM employing a two-terminal setup.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. S. Ianovskaia, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova</p>
            <p>The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of Zeeman-like spin splitting of the local density of states (LDOS). Here we study the magnetic proximity effects in van der Waals S/F heterostructures with a few atomic layers and demonstrate that the corresponding physics is very different from the classical results. We find that the dependence of the superconducting order parameter exhibits dips as a function of the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The number of dips is determined by the number of monolayers in the heterostructure and, in general, the superconductivity is not suppressed by large values of the exchange field. The spin splitting of the LDOS cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field and manifests a multiple peak structure, where each peak is connected to a unique spin splitting of one of the superconducting bands, which also can be tuned by gating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Masłowski, Hadi Cheraghi, Jesko Sirker, Nicholas Sedlmayr</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions are non-analyticities in a dynamical free energy (or return rate) which occur at critical times. Although extensively studied in one dimension, the exact nature of the non-analyticity in two and three dimensions has not yet been fully investigated. In two dimensions, results so far are known only for relatively simple two-band models. Here we study the general two- and three-dimensional cases. We establish the relation between the non-analyticities in different dimensions, and the functional form of the densities of Fisher zeroes. We show, in particular, that entering a critical region where the density of Fisher zeroes is non-zero at the boundary always leads to a cusp in the derivative of the return rate while the return rate itself is smooth. We illustrate our results by obtaining analytical results for exemplary two- and three-dimensional models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janet Zhong, Heming Wang, Shanhui Fan</p>
            <p>There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. An alternate `pole-zero' approach uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</p>

            <p>We give a description of cell diffusion in a soft tissue, paying special attention to the coupling of force, matter, and microforce balance laws through a suitable dissipation principle. To this end, we cast our framework into a multi-level schematics, comprising both kinematics and kinetics, based on a characterization of the free energy. We lay down first a force balance law, where force and stress fields are defined as power conjugate quantities to velocity fields and their gradients, then we give a species molar balance law, with chemical potential test fields, as power conjugate quantities to the rate of change of the species concentration, and finally a microforce balance law. The main feature of this framework is the constitutive expression for the chemical potential which is split into a term derived from the homogeneous convex part of the free energy and an active external chemical potential giving rise to the spinodal decomposition. The active part of the chemical potential is given an expression depending on the cell concentration and resembling the one defined in [Oster, Murray and Harris, J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 78 (1983)], where it is meant to characterize an upward cell diffusion induced by cell motility. Further we show how an external vector field, entering the microforce balance law as a power conjugate quantity to the rate of change of the concentration gradient, can guide the diffusion process to a different limit stationary pattern. This vector field could possibly model any directional cue or bias characterizing the interaction of the migrating cells and the surrounding tissue.</p>

            <p>Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we construct a time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes, and observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges. Using a frequency-comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong-coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes, analogous to the well-known Young's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</p>

We demonstrate that by utilizing the AC Zeeman effect, it is possible to image spin waves propagating in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film over a wide frequency range up to a maximum detuning of 567 MHz without changing the external magnetic field. Our results expand the applicability of NV centers for spin-wave sensing and pave the way for quantitative investigations of the dynamics in various magnetic materials, such as metallic ferromagnets and van der Waals magnets.</p>

            <p>Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.</p>

            <p>When exploring new magnetic materials, the effect of alloying plays a crucial role for numerous properties. By altering the alloy composition, it is possible to tailor, e.g., the Curie temperature ($T_\text{C}$). In this work, $T_\text{C}$ of various alloys is investigated using a previously developed technique [Brännvall et al. Phys. Rev. Mat. (2024)] designed for robust predictions of $T_\text{C}$ across diverse chemistries and structures. The technique is based on density functional theory calculations and utilizes the energy difference between the magnetic ground state and the magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. It also accounts for the magnetic entropy in the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors. The experimentally known systems, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$, NiMnSb-based Heusler alloys, Ti$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$N, and Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ are investigated. The experimentally unexplored system Fe$_{1-x}$Tc$_x$ is also tested to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method in guiding future experimental efforts. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed method across various systems, requiring less hands-on adjustments compared to other theoretical approaches.</p>

            <p>Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modelled by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains affine but the relation is not additive.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>Scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements, which underpins the phenomenon known as the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). However, typical decoherence noises disrupts the volume law phase, complicating the observation of MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enabling its detection in experiment. The transition is characterized by the conditional entanglement entropy (CEE), which is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as competing external random fields. When the net external field is zero, a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting in the MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an average apparatus-environment symmetry, making CEE a valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as a genuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we provide numerical results demonstrate the MIPT in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum circuit under dephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate, enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally and ensuring the feasibility of our protocol. Our result serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise.</p>

            <p>Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong-Xin Miao</p>
            <p>Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</p>

            <p>The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</h2>

            <p>Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</p>

            <p>As the extremely-sized nanocrystals and nanopores, an adatom M and atomic vacancy V exhibit extraordinary capability of catalysis with however little knowledge about the catalyst-reactant interfacial bonding dynamics. With the aid of DFT calculations, we examined the dehydrogenization of a single CH4 molecule catalyzed using the Rh(111,100), W(110), Ru(0001) surfaces, and monolayer graphene, with and without M or V. It is uncovered in the following three components: (i) catalyst polarization due to atomic under- or hetero-coordination raises the valence band of the catalyst by bond contraction and atomistic dipolar MP and vacancy dipolar V formation; (ii) reactant bond elongation by the interplay of the MP-V = H attraction and MP-V = C repulsion with the = denoting the negative pole of the MP-V; and (iii) reactant conversion, i.e., the scale of H-C elongation, the catalyst valence-band shift, the adsorption energy, and the catalytic activity are proportional to the charge quantity of the MP-V whose local electric field matters.</p>

            <h2>Physics-informed Transformers for Electronic Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Augusto Sobral, Michael Perle, Mathias S. Scheurer</p>
            <p>Neural-network-based variational quantum states in general, and more recently autoregressive models in particular, have proven to be powerful tools to describe complex many-body wave functions. However, their performance crucially depends on the computational basis chosen and they often lack physical interpretability. To mitigate these issues, we here propose a modified variational Monte-Carlo framework which leverages prior physical information to construct a computational second-quantized basis containing a reference state that serves as a rough approximation to the true ground state. In this basis, a Transformer is used to parametrize and autoregressively sample the corrections to the reference state, giving rise to a more interpretable and computationally efficient representation of the ground state. We demonstrate this approach using a non-sparse fermionic model featuring a metal-insulator transition and employing Hartree-Fock and a strong-coupling limit to define physics-informed bases. We also show that the Transformer's hidden representation captures the natural energetic order of the different basis states. This work paves the way for more efficient and interpretable neural quantum-state representations.</p>

            <h2>Field-Resilient Supercurrent Diode in a Multiferroic Josephson Junction</h2>

            <p>The research on supercurrent diodes has surged rapidly due to their potential applications in electronic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. To unlock this functionality, it is essential to find supercurrent diodes that can work consistently at zero magnetic field and under ubiquitous stray fields generated in electronic circuits. However, a supercurrent diode with robust field tolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient supercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson junction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero magnetic field. More importantly, the supercurrent rectification persists over a wide and bipolar magnetic field range beyond industrial standards for field tolerance. By theoretically modeling a multiferroic Josephson junction, we unveil that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and multiferroicity underlies the unusual field resilience of the observed diode effect. This work introduces multiferroic Josephson junctions as a new field-resilient superconducting device for cryogenic electronics.</p>

            <h2>Multiparty Entanglement Microscopy of Quantum Ising models in 1d, 2d and 3d</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuke Lyu, Menghan Song, Ting-Tung Wang, Zi Yang Meng, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems arXiv:2402.14916. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.</p>

            <h2>Quantum charge sensing using semiconductor device based on $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan P. Mendez, Denis Mamaluy</p>
            <p>We report a novel nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that FET-based sensors utilizing APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e. for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.</p>

            <h2>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianye Yu, Ijaz Shahid, Peitao Liu, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the Néel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the Néel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the Néel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Cuono, Andrea Droghetti, Silvia Picozzi</p>
            <p>First-principles calculations are employed to study the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding visible light energy, limiting their photovoltaic performance. Featuring a visible-range band gap, SbSI instead combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. The calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct Rashba-Dresselhaus and Weyl-like spin textures relevant for spintronics. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting large photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it can serve to identify the phase of the material, with the circular photogalvanic effect which also reflects spin-texture changes. With its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising material candidate for efficient solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.</p>

            <p>The discovery of novel superconducting materials is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with a wealth of potential for applications in energy, transportation, and computing. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled expediting the search for new materials by efficiently utilizing vast materials databases. In this study, we developed an approach based on deep learning (DL) to predict new superconducting materials. We have synthesized a compound derived from our DL network and confirmed its superconducting properties in agreement with our prediction. Our approach is also compared to previous work based on random forests (RFs). In particular, RFs require knowledge of the chem-ical properties of the compound, while our neural net inputs depend solely on the chemical composition. With the help of hints from our network, we discover a new ternary compound $\textrm{Mo}_{20}\textrm{Re}_{6}\textrm{Si}_{4}$, which becomes superconducting below 5.4 K. We further discuss the existing limitations and challenges associated with using AI to predict and, along with potential future research directions.</p>

            <h2>Shot noise and universal Fano factor as characterization of strongly correlated metals</h2>

            <p>Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems. Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a correlation regime. Thus, we establish the aforementioned Fano factor as universal to Fermi liquids, and show that the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.</p>
