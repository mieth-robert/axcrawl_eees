            <h2>Terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Benhamou-Bui, C. Consejo, S.S. Krishtopenko, S. Ruffenach, C. Bray, J. Torres, J. Dzian, F. Le Mardelé, A. Pagot, X. Baudry, S.V. Morozov, N.N. Mikhailov, S.A. Dvoretskii, B. Jouault, P. Ballet, M. Orlita, C. Ciuti, F. Teppe</p>
            <p>We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.</p>

            <h2>Long-Lived Coherence between Incoherent Excitons revealed by Time-Resolved ARPES: An Exact Solution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenlin Zhang, Wei Hu, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>We investigate the exciton dynamics in an exactly solvable two-band model for semiconductors. The model incorporates light-matter, electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and captures exciton formation as well as the transition from the coherent to the incoherent regime. We analyze excitonic polarization, populations and coherences, with special focus on their impact in Time-Resolved and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). For nonresonant pumping with below-gap photon energies, TR-ARPES spectra reveal distinct excitonic replica and quantum beats persisting in the incoherent regime. These are due to a coherence between different species of {\em incoherent} excitons. Such type of coherence is resistant to phonon dephasing, indicating that it follows different dynamics than those governing the coherences considered so far.</p>

            <h2>Non-Reciprocal Current-Phase Relation and Superconducting Diode Effect in Topological-Insulator-Based Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Kudriashov, X. Zhou, R.A. Hovhannisyan, A. Frolov, L. Elesin, Y. Wang, E.V. Zharkova, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, L.A. Yashina, Z. Liu, Xin Zhou, K.S. Novoselov, D.A. Bandurin</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions (JJ) are essential for superconducting quantum technologies and searches of self-conjugate quasiparticles, pivotal for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity of Bad Fermions: Origin of Two Gaps in HTSC Cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.A. Stepanov, S. Iskakov, M.I. Katsnelson, A.I. Lichtenstein</p>
            <p>We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.</p>

            <h2>Strong impact of low-level substitution of Mn by Fe on the magnetoelectric coupling in $TbMnO_{3}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Maia, R. Vilarinho, P. Proschek, M. Lebeda, M. Mihalik jr., M. Mihalik, P. Manuel, D. D. Khalyavin, S. Kamba, J. Agostinho Moreira</p>
            <p>The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic structure was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phase as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic field-dependent pyroelectric current measurements revealed significantly higher magnetoelectric coupling at magnetic fields below 4 T than in pure TbMnO3. This is due to the higher sensitivity of the incommensurably modulated cycloid structure to weak magnetic fields. Detailed analysis of our data confirmed that the ferroelectric polarization is induced by inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for magnetic field strength up to 4 T, but at higher fields a departure from theoretical predictions is ascertained, giving evidence for an additional, as yet misunderstood, contribution to magnetoelectric coupling. It shows that a small 2% substitution of Mn3+ by Fe3+ has a strong impact on the magnetic structure, promoting the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T. We demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling magnitude can be tuned through suitable substitutional elements, even at low level, inducing local lattice distortions with different electronic and magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederico B. Sousa, Alessandra Ames, Mingzu Liu, Pedro L. Gastelois, Vinícius A. Oliveira, Da Zhou, Matheus J. S. Matos, Helio Chacham, Mauricio Terrones, Marcio D. Teodoro, Leandro M. Malard</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Spectral and Entanglement Properties of the Random Exchange Heisenberg Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilun Gao, Rudolf A. Römer</p>
            <p>We study the many-body localization problem in the non-abelian SU(2)-invariant random antiferromagnetic exchange model in 1D. Exact and sparse matrix diagonalization methods are used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix. We investigate the behaviour of the energy level gap-ratio statistic, participation ratio, entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectral parameter as a function of disorder strength. Different distributions of random couplings are considered. We find, up to $L=24$, a clear distinction between our non-abelian model and the more often studied random field Heisenberg model: the regime of seemingly localized behaviour is much less pronounced in the random exchange model than in the field model case.</p>

            <h2>Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a Majorana qubit in a quantum dot-superconductor array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma, Chun-Xiao Liu</p>
            <p>The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance -- longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical kinetic energy quenching in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Borissov, Vladimir Calvera, Sung-Sik Lee</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of critical spin fluctuations and hot electrons at the metallic antiferromagnetic quantum critical points with $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ spin symmetries, building upon earlier works on the $O(3)$ symmetric theory. The interacting theories in $2+1$ dimensions are approached from $3+1$-dimensional theories in the $\epsilon$-expansion that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface as a control parameter. The low-energy physics of the $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ theories qualitatively differ from each other and also from that of the $O(3)$ theory. The difference is caused by higher-order quantum corrections beyond the one-loop order that are important even to the leading order in $\epsilon$. The naive loop-expansion breaks down due to dynamical quenching of kinetic energy: the speed of the collective mode ($c$) and the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ordering vector ($v$) become vanishingly small at low energies. What sets the three theories apart is the hierarchy that emerges between the quenched kinetic terms. At the infrared fixed point, $c/v$ becomes $0$, $1$ and $\infty$ in the $Z_2$, $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ theories, respectively. At intermediate energy scales, the slow renormalization group (RG) flows of $c$ and $v$ toward their fixed point values create approximate scale invariance controlled by approximate marginal parameters. The manifold of those quasi-fixed points and the RG flow therein determines crossovers from scaling behaviours with transient critical exponents at intermediate energy scales to the universal scaling in the low-energy limit. If the symmetry group is viewed as a tuning parameter, the $O(2)$ theory corresponds to a multi-critical point which has one additional quasi-marginal parameter than the other two theories.</p>

            <h2>Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-feng Yang</p>
            <p>The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>To veryfy "hot supreconductivity" recently proposed in lanthanum hydride-based compounds, we explored thermodynamically stable and superconducting phases in the lanthanum (La)-platinum (Pt)-hydrogen (H) ternary system at 20 GPa using an evolutionary construction scheme of a formation-enthalpy convex hull, universal neural network potential calculations, and density functional theory calculations. Although we found no evidence of the hot superconductivity in this ternary system, we predicted a unique compound, LaPtH$_{ 6 }$, which has equilateral triangular H$_{ 3 }$ units nearly forming a two-dimensional kagome lattice between La and Pt layers and shows the superconductivity at 18.67 K. This structure is dynamically stable from ambient pressure to at least 200 GPa and the superconducting critical temperature increases from 13.51 to 40.63 K.</p>

            <p>Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.</p>

            <h2>Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, S. Das Sarma, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <h2>Many-body perturbation theory for moiré systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liangtao Peng, Giovanni Vignale, Shaffique Adam</p>
            <p>Moiré systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have attracted significant attention due to their ability to host correlated phenomena including superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating states. By defining the single-particle Green's function in the band basis, we systematically develop a many-body perturbation theory framework to address correlations beyond the usual mean-field Hartree-Fock approaches. As a specific example, we first analyze twisted bilayer graphene within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive analytical solutions for symmetry-breaking states at integer fillings and the finite-temperature metal-insulator transition that closely match previously known numerical results in the literature. Moving beyond Hartree-Fock, we incorporate self-consistent GW corrections demonstrating that first-order diagrams significantly overestimate the filling-dependent fluctuations in the electronic compressibility. This framework provides a comprehensive pathway for exploring strong electronic correlations in moiré systems beyond mean-field, giving new insights into the interplay of symmetry breaking and electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>Operation of a high-frequency, phase-slip qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheeranjeev Purmessur, Kaicheung Chow, Bernard van Heck, Angela Kou</p>
            <p>Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A phase-slip junction, the dual of a Josephson junction, provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Phase-slip junctions have been challenging, however, to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters. Here we demonstrate the operation of a superconducting qubit based on a phase slip junction made using titanium nitride. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (~17 GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes >60 $\mu$s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the phase-slip junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephan Rachel, Roland Wiesendanger</p>
            <p>For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</p>

            <h2>Density Functional Tight-Binding Captures Plasmon-Driven H$_2$ Dissociation on Al Nanocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil S. Chellam, George C. Schatz</p>
            <p>Aluminum nanocrystals offer a promising platform for plasmonic photocatalysis, yet a detailed understanding of their electron dynamics and consequent photocatalytic performance has been challenging thus far due to computational limitations. Here, we employ density functional tight-binding methods (DFTB) to investigate the optical properties and H<sub>2</sub> dissociation dynamics of Al nanocrystals with varying sizes and geometries. Our real-time simulations reveal that Al's unique free-electron nature enables efficient light-matter interactions and rapid electronic thermalization. Cubic and octahedral nanocrystals ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 nm exhibit size-dependent plasmon resonances in the UV, with distinct spectral features arising from the particle geometry and electronic structure. By simulating H<sub>2</sub> dissociation near Al nanocrystals, we demonstrate that hot electrons generated through plasmon excitation can overcome the molecule's strong chemical bond within tens of femtoseconds. The laser intensity threshold is comparable to previous reports for Ag nanocrystals, though significantly lower than that of Au. Notably, the dipolar plasmon mode demonstrates higher efficiency for this reaction than the localized interband transition for particles at these sizes. Taken together, this work provides mechanistic insights into plasmon-driven catalysis and showcases DFTB's capability to study quantum plasmonics at unprecedented length and time scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Oliveira-Cony, C. Farina, P. P. Abrantes, Tarik P. Cysne</p>
            <p>We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>An Unconventional Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Receiving Nano-Antenna Activated by ac Spin Pumping and the ac Inverse Spin Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raisa Fabiha, Michael Suche, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of topological superconductivity in the presence of chiral magnetism in 2D CrInTe$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnob Mukherjee, Fengyi Zhou, Soheil Ershadrad, Tanay Nag, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>We propose a general framework for designing a two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductor (TSC) using a magnet-superconductor hybrid system. This setup involves a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, which hosts noncoplanar magnetic textures, in proximity to a 2D $s$-wave superconducting layer. Serving as an alternative to $p$-wave superconductors, this configuration induces a topological superconducting phase and is a promising platform for realizing the 2D Kitaev model, which supports Majorana zero-energy modes through emergent $p$-wave symmetry superconducting pairing. Notably, the magnetic moments break time-reversal symmetry while the superconducting state preserves particle-hole symmetry, placing our system in the Altland-Zirnbauer class $D$ and ensuring robust Majorana excitations. We first perform density functional theory-based simulations to study a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, from which essential magnetic characteristic parameters, such as Heisenberg exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), are calculated using the state-of-the-art Liechtenstein-Katsnelson-Antropov-Gubanov (LKAG) approach. With a substantial DMI coupling exhibited in CrInTe$_3$, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal the stabilization of a noncoplanar spiral magnetic state as ground state. In this magnetic phase, we observe a transition from corner modes in the zero-energy local density of states (LDOS) to edge modes as the chemical potential ($\mu$) varies. Furthermore, under a finite magnetic field, the system enters a mixed magnetic state, characterized by isolated skyrmions and spiral domain walls, which lead to unique low-energy localization of electronic wave functions, rendering the system an insulator. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations of TSC in this magnet-superconductor interfacial system, using real-space probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

            <p>Realizing topological superconductivity in stoichiometric materials is a key challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, $M$IrGe ($M$ = Ti, Hf), as prime candidates for topological superconductivity, predicted to exhibit nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, we establish these materials as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in $M$IrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain- a ring of fourfold-degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states establishes $M$IrGe as a rare and robust platform to realize topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zuzhang Lin, Hsun-Chi Chan, Wenqi Yang, Yixin Sha, Cong Xiao, Shuang Zhang, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>In an electronic system, spontaneous symmetry breaking can arise from many-body interaction between electrons, leading to degenerate ground states distinguishable by emergent effects otherwise prohibited by the symmetry. Here we show that ultrastrong coupling of a mesoscopic electronic system to the vacuum of a cavity resonator can lead to another paradigm of spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries in both systems. As a pertinent example, we consider the orbital gyrotropic effects in a moiré superlattice embedded in a THz split ring cavity resonator. Our mean-field and exact diagonalization calculations consistently demonstrate a spontaneous parity symmetry breaking in both the electronic ground state and the cavity vacuum, leading to two degenerate hybrid ground states distinguished by their opposite orbital gyrotropic Hall and magnetic effects. These sizable responses in the cavity-embedded moiré superlattice are highly tunable by both the cavity field polarization and interlayer bias on the moiré superlattice, providing an advanced platform for manipulating gyrotropic effects.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</p>

We posit that interacting and topological states can be identified from distinct signatures within the probability distribution of the charge states. Furthermore, the comprehensive dataset provides direct access to information theory metrics elucidating the entanglement between the charge sector of the superconductor and the microscopic degrees of freedom in the junction. We demonstrate how these metrics serve to further classify differences between the types of excitations in the junction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max L. Prichard, Benjamin M. Spar, Ivan Morera, Eugene Demler, Zoe Z. Yan, Waseem S. Bakr</p>
            <p>The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huizi Xie, Sirui Yu, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin</p>
            <p>In this work we revisit the problem of a Majorana box qubit (MBQ) readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the MBQ are associated with the combined fermion parities of the MBQ and its tunnel-coupled quantum dot, which is measured by a PC detector. Beyond the existing studies on limiting bias voltage regimes, we analyze the steady-state current and the current power spectrum across all bias voltages. Our results indicate that the MBQ readout via the parity-dependent detector current is effective only at low bias voltage regime and requires the dot energy level to be off-resonance with the Majorana qubit. In contrast, the current power spectrum allows MBQ readout through the parity-dependent Rabi oscillation peak signals for arbitrary bias voltages, without restrictions on the dot energy level. Particularly, with focus on the MBQ measurement visibility, we analyze the peak-to-pedestal ratio for each characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. By examining these two metrics, we identify the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.</p>

            <h2>Mapping Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions to inversion asymmetry in perovskite oxide heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nirmal Ganguli, Avishek Singh, Vivek Kumar, Jayita Chakraborty</p>
            <p>Inversion asymmetry, combined with spin-orbit interaction, leads to Rashba or Dresselhaus effects, or combinations of them that are promising for technologies based on antiferromagnetic spintronics. Since understanding the exact nature of spin-orbit interaction is crucial for developing a technology based on it, mapping the nature of inversion asymmetry with the type of spin-orbit interaction becomes the key. We simulate a perovskite oxide heterostructure LaAlO$_3|$SrIrO$_3|$SrTiO$_3$ preserving the inversion symmetry within density functional theory to demonstrate the relation between the nature of inversion asymmetry and the corresponding Rashba or Dresselhaus-type interaction. With progressive distortion in the heterostructure, we find how the structure inversion asymmetry sets in with distorted bond lengths and bond angles, leading to Rashba effect in the system. Further, introduction of tilted IrO$_6$ octahedra leads to bulk inversion asymmetry, helping a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction to set in. A comparison of the spin textures obtained from our DFT calculations and theoretical modeling helps us identify the exact nature of the interactions. Besides demonstrating the connection between the nature of asymmetry with Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, our work may serve as a guide to identifying different types of Rashba-like spin-orbit interactions.</p>

            <h2>Effective grand-canonical description of condensation in negative-temperature regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi</p>
            <p>The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand-canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable and their lifetime $\tau$ is exponentially long with the temperature, $\tau \approx \exp(\lambda |T|)$ (for $T<0$). A general expression for $\lambda$ is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of non-interacting particles. In the DNLS model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant, makes $\lambda$ even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.</p>

            <h2>Strain stiffening due to stretching of entangled particles in random packings of granular materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Brown, Kevin A. Mitchell, Alice Nasto, Athanasios Athanassiadis, Heinrich M. Jaeger</p>
            <p>Stress-strain relations for random packings of entangling chains under triaxial compression can exhibit strain stiffening and sustain stresses several orders-of-magnitude beyond typical granular materials. X-ray tomography reveals the transition to this strong strain stiffening occurs when chains are long enough to entangle an average of about one chain each, which results in system-filling clusters of entangled chains. The number of entanglements is nearly proportional to the area surrounded by entangling particles with an excluded volume effect. A tendency was found for chain links to stretch when the packing was strained. The slope of the stress-strain relation of the packing can be calculated from a mean-field model consisting of the product of the effective extensional modulus of the chain, packing fraction, probability of stretched links, and the ratio of strain of stretched links to packing strain. The stress-strain model requires as input measurements of the ratio between local particle deformation and global average strain, and the probability of stretching for non-rigid particles. This results in a quadratic prediction for the stress-strain curve, with a curvature that agrees with experiments within the model uncertainties. This model explains that the strength of these packings comes from stretching of the links of chains, but only when the system-filling network of entanglements provides constraints that prevents failure by shear banding, so that particles must be deformed to move further under strain. In this model, the increasing slope of the stress-strain curve is mainly due to the fraction of stretched links increasing with strain. This model for the stress-strain relation is shown to be generalizable to different shapes of entangling particles by applying it to staples.</p>

            <h2>Quantum loops in the 1T transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashland Knowles, G. Baskaran, R. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Loop arrangements and their quantum superpositions describe several interesting many-particle states. We propose that they also describe bonding in a class of transition metal dichalcogenides. We present an effective quantum loop model for monolayers with 1T structure and a d$^2$ valence electron configuration: materials of the form MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te) and AM$'$Y$_2$ (A = Li, Na; M$'$ = V, Nb and Y = O, S, Se). Their t$_{2g}$ orbitals exhibit strongly directional overlaps between neighbouring atoms, favouring the formation of valence bonds. A transition metal atom forms two valence bonds, each with one of its neighbours. When connected, these bonds form loops that cover the triangular lattice. We construct a minimal Rokhsar-Kivelson-like model with resonance processes that cut and reconnect loops that run in proximity. The resulting dynamics is more constrained than in traditional quantum dimer models, with a `bending' constraint that arises from orbital structure. In the resulting phase diagram, we find phases that resemble distorted phases seen in materials, viz., the 1T$'$ and trimerized phases. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single d$^1$ or d$^3$ impurity will terminate a loop and give rise to a long-ranged texture. For example, a Ti/Cr defect in LiVO$_2$ will produce one or more domain walls that propagate outward from the impurity. We discuss the possibility of a loop liquid phase that can emerge in these materials.</p>

            <h2>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgia Marcelli, Tecla Bottinelli Montandon, Roya Ebrahimi Viand, Felix Höfling</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</p>

The invention of periodic poling revolutionized nonlinear optics and its commercial applications by enabling robust quasi-phase-matching in crystals such as lithium niobate. However, reaching useful frequency conversion efficiencies requires macroscopic dimensions, limiting further technology development and integration. Here we realize a periodically poled van der Waals semiconductor (3R-MoS$_2$). Due to its exceptional nonlinearity, we achieve macroscopic frequency conversion efficiency of 0.03% at the relevant telecom wavelength over a microscopic thickness of 3.4${\mu}$m (that is, 3 poling periods), $10-100\times$ thinner than current systems with similar performances. Due to unique intrinsic cavity effects, the thickness-dependent quasi-phase-matched second harmonic signal surpasses the usual quadratic enhancement by $50\%$. Further, we report the broadband generation of photon pairs at telecom wavelengths via quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion, showing a maximum coincidence-to-accidental-ratio of $638 \pm 75$. This work opens the new and unexplored field of phase-matched nonlinear optics with microscopic van der Waals crystals, unlocking applications that require simple, ultra-compact technologies such as on-chip entangled photon-pair sources for integrated quantum circuitry and sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duyu Chen, Rhine Samajdar, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.</p>

            <p>Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.</p>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information applications, owing to their efficient and bright single photon emission. Despite the challenges in directly characterizing these emitters, the interaction between external fields and defects, such as the Stark shift, offers valuable insights into their local geometric configurations. In this study, we focus on clarifying the possible origin of the distinct Stark shift characteristics observed experimentally, particularly in the emission range around 2 eV. We find that the local symmetry of the defects plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the Stark shift, which can be either linear or quadratic. Additionally, the local dielectric environment significantly influences the Stark shift response. Our calculations not only enhance the understanding of the micro-structure of these hitherto unknown emitters but also pave the way for their more effective utilization as single-photon sources and qubits in quantum technologies.</p>

In this work, we experimentally measure the optical response of high-quality monolayer TMD heterostructures and compare the results with the different theoretical models to address this uncertainty. We find that in high-quality heterostructures, quantum mechanical interactions in the form of pure dephasing plays a dominant role, which has been challenging to isolate experimentally in previous studies. Furthermore, accounting for an additional decay rate to the commonly used radiative and non-radiative rates is found to be important for the accurate description of the excitonic response. These findings establish a robust framework for understanding and predicting the optical properties of TMD-based heterostructures, crucial for both fundamental research and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Presence of excitons significantly influence the optoelectronic properties and potential applications of materials. Using combined theoretical and experimental tools, we investigate the absorption spectra of $d^0$ double perovskite oxides Ba$_{2}$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Nb, Ta, Sb), Ba$_{2}$Sc$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Ta, Sb) and $A_{2}$ScSbO$_6$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba), allowing for a systematic variation of composition. We not only show that low-energy excitons are present in the visible range in {\it all} the considered so-called wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these exciton modes differ from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a detailed and comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Further, our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.</p>

            <p>We study a micro-magnet that interacts with a spin-polarized electric current, a heat bath, as well as a static magnetic field. The resulting non-equilibrium steady-state transports entropy between the current and the heat bath, without need of any thermodynamic force. In the limit of strong magnetic field, both the entropy production rate and the fluctuation of entropy transport become vanishingly small, whereas the average rate of entropy transport remains finite.

            <h2>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</p>

The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with numerically-obtained values with the exciton-reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $4.6$ meV. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with the low losses and the sub-wavelength light confinement, could pave the way towards single-photon nonlinearities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Rottoli, Michele Mazzoni, Fabio Sailis, Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo</p>
            <p>In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</p>

Efficiently simulating the quantum-classical electronic interface is hence of paramount importance.

Our models are capable of faithfully reproducing coherent quantum behavior within a standard electronic circuit simulator, enabling compromise-free co-simulation of hybrid quantum devices. In particular, we present results from co-simulations performed in Cadence Spectre, showcasing coherent quantum phenomena in circuits with both quantum and classical components using an industry-standard electronic design and automation tool. Our work paves the way for a new paradigm in the design of quantum systems, which leverages the many decades of development of electronic computer-aided design and automation tools in the semiconductor industry to now simulate and optimize quantum processing units, quantum-classical interfaces, and hybrid quantum-analog circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bor Kavčič, Gašper Tkačik</p>
            <p>We consider a family of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs), consisting of particles on a lattice that require binding by a "token" in various physical configurations to advance over the lattice. Using a combination of theory and simulations, we address the following questions: (i) How token binding kinetics affects the current-density relation on the lattice; (ii) How this current-density relation depends on the scarcity of tokens; (iii) How tokens propagate the effects of the locally-imposed disorder (such as a slow site) over the entire lattice; (iv) How a shared pool of tokens couples concurrent TASEPs running on multiple lattices; (v) How our results translate to TASEPs with open boundaries that exchange particles with the reservoir. Since real particle motion (including in biological systems that inspired the standard TASEP model, e.g., protein synthesis or movement of molecular motors) is often catalyzed, regulated, actuated, or otherwise mediated, the token-driven TASEP dynamics analyzed in this paper should allow for a better understanding of real systems and enable a closer match between TASEP theory and experimental observations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Albert M. Varonov</p>
            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</p>

            <p>The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental prerequisite of these exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity, nematic order, and checkerboard charge order. Here we explore the filling-dependent multiple stable intertwined electronic and atomic orders of flat-band state of 1T-TaS2 encompassing hole order, phase orders, coexisting left- and right-chiral orders and mixed phase/chiral orders via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Combining first-principles calculations, the emergent electronic/atomic orders can be attributed to the weakening of electron-electron correlations and stacking-dependent interlayer interactions. Moreover, achiral intermediate ring-like clusters and nematic charge density wave (CDW) states are successfully realized in intralayer chiral domain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions through chiral overlap configurations. Our study not only deepens the understanding of filling-dependent electronic/atomic orders in flat-band systems, but also offers perspectives for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <p>Cells not only can be motile by crawling but are also capable of non-motility active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayer.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide (BA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$ and phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide (PEA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$. By examining the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations, as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant correlations with the same. Additionally, we observed photoluminescence emission peak splitting for both systems, which becomes prominent above certain critical temperatures where the suppression of PLQY begins. This study suggests that the rotational motions of polarized molecules may lead to a reduction in exciton binding energy or the breaking of degeneracy in exciton binding energy levels, enhancing non-radiative recombination rates, and consequently reducing photoluminescence yield. These findings offer a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions in 2D HOIPs and could guide the design of more efficient light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.</p>

After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Torben Sunkel, Lukas Hupe, Philip Bittihn</p>
            <p>Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</p>

            <p>Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the spin-charge current conversion characteristics of chemically disordered ferromagnetic single FePt thin films by spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance experiments performed on both a resonance cavity and on patterned devices. We clearly observe a self-induced signal in a single FePt layer. The sign of a single FePt spin pumping voltage signal is consistent with a typical bilayer with a positive spin Hall angle layer such as that of Pt on top of a ferromagnet (FM), substrate//FM/Pt. Structural analysis shows a strong composition gradient due to natural oxidation at both FePt interfaces, with the Si substrate and with the air. The FePt-thickness dependence of the self-induced charge current produced allowed us to obtain $\lambda _ \text{FePt}=(1.5\pm 0.1)$ nm and self-induced $\theta_ \text{self-FePt}=0.047 \pm 0.003$, with efficiency for reciprocal effects applications $\theta _ \text{self-FePt} \times \lambda _ \text{FePt} = 0.071$ nm which is comparable to that of Pt, $\theta _ \text{SH-Pt} \times \lambda _ \text{Pt} = 0.2$ nm. Moreover, by studying bilayer systems such as Si//FePt/Pt and Si//Pt//FePt we independently could extract the individual contributions of the external inverse spin Hall effect of Pt and the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect of FePt. Notably, this method gives consistent values of charge currents produced due to only self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in FePt layers. These results advance our understanding of spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms in composite thin films and pave the way for the development of next-generation spintronics devices based on self-torque.</p>

            <p>A simple three-dimensional model of a fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials as far as the intercluster structure is concerned.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.L. Rosinberg, G. Tarjus, T. Munakata</p>
            <p>Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mykhailo V. Rakov, Luca Tagliacozzo, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Titas Chanda</p>
            <p>We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</p>

            <h2>Time evolution of the local density of states of strongly correlated fermions coupled to a nanoprobe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Blum, Reinhard M. Noack, Salvatore R. Manmana</p>
            <p>We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Generation and Stabilization by Coherent Collisions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Mert Bozkurt, Rosa López, Sungguen Ryu</p>
            <p>Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</p>

            <h2>Berry curvature and shift vector effects at high-order wave mixing in biased bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H.K. Avetissian, H.H. Matevosyan, G.F. Mkrtchian</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a microscopic quantum theory that elucidates the nonlinear and nonperturbative optical response of biased bilayer graphene subjected to bichromatic strong laser fields. This response is analyzed using a four-band Hamiltonian derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations. For the laser-stimulated dynamics, we employ structure gauge-invariant evolutionary equations to accurately describe the evolution of the single-particle density matrix across the entire Brillouin zone. The resonant generation of electron-hole pairs by the high-frequency component of the field, combined with the induction of high-order harmonic generation and high-order wave mixing by the strong low-frequency field component, leads to significant alterations in the resulting spectra. These changes are driven by the effects of Berry curvature and the shift vector, which modify the relative contributions of interband and intraband channels, thereby fundamentally reshaping the radiation spectra at high-order frequency multiplication. The numerical results are further supported by approximate analytical calculations, demonstrating that high-order wave mixing can be modeled using the classical trajectory analysis of electron-hole pairs, with Berry curvature and the shift vector significantly influencing the saddle-point equations.</p>

Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</p>

            <p>As a promising candidate for altermagnet, CrSb possesses a distinctive compensated spin split band structure that could bring groundbreaking concepts to the field of spintronics. In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. After careful analysis of the transport data, we conclude the non-linearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal, with the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have successfully reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.</p>

            <h2>Transverse voltage in anisotropic hydrodynamic conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaize Wang, Chunyu Guo, Philip J.W. Moll, Tobias Holder</p>
            <p>Weak momentum dissipation in ultra-clean metals gives rise to novel non-Ohmic current flow, including ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes. Recently, hydrodynamic flow has attracted intense interest because it presents a valuable window into the electronic correlations and the longest lived collective modes of quantum materials. However, diagnosing viscous flow is difficult as the macroscopic observables of ballistic and hydrodynamic transport such as the average current distribution can be deceptively similar, even if their respective microscopics deviate notably. Based on kinetic Boltzmann theory, here we propose to address this issue via the transverse channel voltage at zero magnetic field, which can efficiently detect hydrodynamic flow in a number of materials. To this end, we show that the transverse voltage is sensitive to the interplay between anisotropic fermiology and boundary scattering, resulting in a non-trivial behavior in narrow channels along crystalline low-symmetry directions. We discuss several materials where the channel-size dependent stress of the quantum fluid leads to a characteristic sign change of the transverse voltage as a new hallmark of the cross-over from the ballistic to the hydrodynamic regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</p>

            <p>We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</p>

The heat capacity, magnetization and NMR relaxation times of the $^{3}$He were measured over a wide temperature range from 200 $\mu$K to 500 mK. They provide evidence for changes in the ground state in the second layer film as the amount of $^{4}$He is increased at various fixed $^{3}$He doses. Clear evidence is obtained for a solid second layer film, matching the r\a'egime of superfluid response previously observed in pure $^{4}$He films.</p>

We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Sekino, Yuya Ominato, Hiroyuki Tajima, Shun Uchino, Mamoru Matsuo</p>
            <p>We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <p>Maximum entropy methods, based on the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, are essential for modeling interactions between pairs of variables in data-driven problems across disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their considerable success, these methods typically fail to capture higher-order interactions that are often essential for understanding complex systems. Conversely, modern machine learning methods capture these complex interactions, but the computational cost of interpretable frameworks makes them impractical for real-world applications. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient way to capture statistical correlations using hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. In this study, we introduce a new method that maps RBMs to generalized Potts models, allowing for the extraction of interactions up to any specified order. This method utilizes large-$N$ approximations, enabled by the RBM's simple structure, to extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. Furthermore, we propose a robust framework for extracting higher-order interactions in more complex probabilistic models and a simple gauge-fixing method within the effective many-body Potts model. Our validation on synthetic datasets confirms the method's ability to recover two- and three-body interactions accurately. When applied to protein sequence data, the framework competently reconstructs protein contact maps and provides performance comparable to the best inverse Potts models. These findings confirm that RBMs are an effective and streamlined tool for exploring higher-order interactions within complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ezequiel E. Ferrero, Eduardo A. Jagla</p>
            <p>Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0<\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</p>

            <p>A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.</p>

            <p>The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</p>

Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</p>

            <h2>Probing spectral features of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinzhao Sun, Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Vlatko Vedral, Andrew T. Boothroyd, M. S. Kim</p>
            <p>The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum circuits with free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balázs Pozsgay, Kohei Fukai</p>
            <p>Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</p>

            <h2>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata</p>
            <p>Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Bachtis, Giulio Biroli, Aurélien Decelle, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Pathak</p>
            <p>Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</p>

We determine the forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and additionally validate the results with explicit analytical flow solutions.

            <p>We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts radiating at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts radiating, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux exhibits oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room- or higher-temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.</p>

            <p>The mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. Also, we have performed synchrotron-based high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the compressibility properties of this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, of three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine relative to terrestrial olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite. The origin of the observed differences is discussed. A simple model combining the results of both our nanoindentation and HP-XRD measurements allows us to describe the contribution of macroscopic and chemical-bond related effects, both of which are necessary to reproduce the observed elastic modulus softening. Such joint analysis of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue for characterizing these highly interesting materials.</p>

            <p>In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro</p>
            <p>Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</p>

            <h2>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lebedev-Stepanov</p>
            <p>The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski (HR) formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. In this paper, the Navier condition is applied to the liquid-liquid boundary for the first time. A generalized HR equation is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the usual HR equation. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids. For infinite viscosity of the drop, it becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano</p>
            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <h2>Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</p>

However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field.

A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.</p>

            <p>While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</p>

            <p>Optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic phenomenon in the spin physics of semiconductors. Here, we investigate spin orientation in MAPbI3 lead halide perovskite crystals at the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K, where the material has an orthorhombic crystal structure. The recombination and spin dynamics of excitons and carriers are measured by time-resolved photoluminescence after circularly polarized excitation. The optical orientation of excitons reaches 85\%, which persists within their lifetime of 15-80 ps. This high orientation is maintained for excitation laser detunings from the exciton resonance to higher energies by up to 0.3 eV, then decreases and vanishes above 1.5 eV detuning. This indicates that the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism based on inversion symmetry breaking is inactive in MAPbI3 crystals with orthorhombic symmetry. The optical orientation of localized and spatially-separated electrons and holes results in 40\% circular polarization of their emission. Their contributions can be identified from the complex spin beats dynamics in transverse magnetic field. The dynamics analysis gives values of the Landé g-factors of 2.83 for electrons and 0.54 for holes. Also, the magnetic-field-induced polarization of excitons and carriers is analyzed in magnetic fields up to 6 T, showing that their spin relaxation times are longer than their lifetimes. Namely, for the excitons, the spin relaxation time exceeds the lifetime by a factor of 6. We model the dynamics of optical orientation degree for cumulative contributions of excitons and carriers and show that the exciton recombination dynamics can control these dynamics. The polarized emission of excitons and localized carriers, produced by their polarization on Zeeman-split levels in magnetic fields, is modeled.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad R. Hasyim, Arkajit Mandal, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Ming Xie, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Ionic Liquid Affinity and Its Effect on Phospholipid Membrane Structure and Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. K. Sharma, J. Gupta, H. Srinivasan, P. Hitaishi, S. K. Ghosh, S. Mitra</p>
            <p>In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.</p>

            <h2>Polarons and Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Polar Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Shahnazaryan, A. Kudlis, I. V. Tokatly</p>
            <p>We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{öh}lich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{öh}lich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to the specific dispersion of LO phonons, the polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <h2>Co-existing topological and Volkov-Pankratov plasmonic edge states in magnetized graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyobrata Mukherjee, Viktoriia Savchuk, Jeffery W. Allen, Monica S. Allen, Gennady Shvets</p>
            <p>Graphene placed in a perpendicular magnetic field supports optical modes known as magnetoplasmons which are transversally confined to the graphene layer. Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dai Q. Ho, D. Quang To, Ruiqi Hu, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</p>

            <p>Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.</p>

            <h2>Electric field tunable bands in doubly aligned bilayer graphene hBN moire superlattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Tiwari, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aveek Bid</p>
            <p>In this letter, we demonstrate electric field-induced band modification of an asymmetrically twisted hBN/BLG/hBN supermoire lattice. Distinct from unaligned BLG/hBN systems, we observe regions in the density-displacement field (n-D) plane where the device conductance is independent of n and decreases as |D| increases. This distinction arises due to the angle asymmetry between the layers, which induces field-controlled layer polarization. We identify D-dependent additional band gaps near the charge neutrality point that appear in the conduction (valence) band for negative (positive) D values. In the quantum Hall regime, new 6-fold degenerate Landau levels are observed. Our findings establish that in an asymmetric supermoire heterostructure, an external vertical displacement field affects the valence and conduction bands very differently and sheds light on the asymmetric conductance patterns noted in previous studies.</p>

            <p>In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Selch, M.A.Zubkov, Souvik Pramanik, M.Lewkowicz</p>
            <p>We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern}. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quasiparticles of a single nodal ring semimetal SrAs$_3$ through axis-resolved magneto-optical measurements. We observe three types of Landau levels scaling as $\varepsilon \sim \sqrt{B}$, $\varepsilon \sim B^{2/3}$, and $\varepsilon \sim B$ that correspond to Dirac, semi-Dirac, and classical fermions, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the distinct origins of these three types of fermions present within the nodal ring. In particular, semi-Dirac fermions--a novel type of fermion that can give rise to a range of unique quantum phenomena--emerge from the endpoints of the nodal ring where the energy band disperses linearly along one direction and quadratically along the perpendicular direction, a feature not achievable in nodal point or line structures. The capacity of the nodal ring to simultaneously host multiple fermion types, including semi-Dirac fermions, establishes it as a valuable platform to expand the understanding of topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter correlations in Quantum Floquet engineering of cavity quantum materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Pérez-González, Gloria Platero, Álvaro Gómez-León</p>
            <p>Quantum Floquet engineering (QFE) seeks to generalize the control of quantum systems with classical external fields, widely known as Semi-Classical Floquet engineering (SCFE), to quantum fields. However, to faithfully capture the physics at arbitrary coupling, a gauge-invariant description of light-matter interaction in cavity-QED materials is required, which makes the Hamiltonian highly non-linear in photonic operators. We provide a non-perturbative truncation scheme of the Hamiltonian, which is valid or arbitrary coupling strength, and use it to investigate the role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in SCFE. We find that even in the high-frequency regime, light-matter correlations can be crucial, in particular for the topological properties of a system. As an example, we show that for a SSH chain coupled to a cavity, light-matter correlations break the original chiral symmetry of the chain, strongly affecting the robustness of its edge states. In addition, we show how light-matter correlations are imprinted in the photonic spectral function and discuss their relation with the topology of the bands.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a kind of collinear magnetism that is characterized by a momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization, has recently attracted considerable interest. Finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping. While this is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, it remains challenging. Here, using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. Tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moiré systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or "spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a "guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moiré systems.</p>

            <p>We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma>\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma<\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects.

Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram</p>
            <p>The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the effects of rotation on the physical properties of a quantum dot described by a radial potential and subjected to a rotating reference frame. The interplay between rotation and confinement is analyzed by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system, yielding energy levels and wavefunctions as functions of angular velocity. We compute key thermodynamic properties, including the density of states, magnetization, entropy, and heat capacity, in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that rotation induces significant modifications to the energy spectrum, removing degeneracies and generating oscillatory behaviors in magnetization akin to de Haas-van Alphen and Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an effect analogous to the magnetocaloric effect, where an increase in angular velocity leads to a decrease in temperature during adiabatic processes. These results reveal the potential of rotational effects to influence quantum systems and provide insights for future studies in mesoscopic physics.</p>

            <p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. We propose an optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser that leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane we invoke geometric frustration between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. Our optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.</p>

            <h2>Revealing the orbital origins of exotic electronic states with Ti substitution in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</h2>

            <p>The multiband kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 exhibits complex orbital textures on the Fermi surface, making the orbital origins of its cascade of correlated electronic states and superconductivity a major scientific puzzle. Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommy Li</p>
            <p>This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</p>

            <p>The intertwining of magnetism with topology is known to give rise to exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the magnetotransport properties of NdAlSi, a magnetic Weyl semimetal that spontaneously breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries and hosts a large number of Weyl nodes. We observe a significant negative magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the chiral anomaly associated with multiple Weyl nodes. Remarkably, the extracted chiral coefficient reaches approximately $52~\mathrm{m\Omega}^{-1}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}~\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, larger than many other topological materials. Additionally, we observe an exotic anomalous Hall effect with an out-of-sync behavior, where the anomalous Hall resistance does not exactly follow the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that in conventional ferromagnets. These rich quantum transport phenomena, driven by the interplay between magnetism and Weyl nodes, establish NdAlSi as a prime platform for exploring the intricate topological behaviors of magnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p>

            <p>Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</p>

            <h2>Strong Long-Wave Infrared Optical Response in a Topological Semiconductor with a Mexican Hat Band Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark J. Polking, Haowei Xu, Raman Sankar, Kevin Grossklaus, Ju Li</p>
            <p>Light sources and photodetectors operating in the far- to mid-infrared (FIR/MIR) band ($8$-$12~\rm \mu m$, $0.1$-$0.15~\rm eV$) remain relatively poorly developed compared to their counterparts operating in the visible and near-infrared ranges, despite extensive application potential for thermal imaging, standoff sensing, and other technologies. This is attributable in part to the lack of narrow-gap materials ($<0.1~\rm eV$) with high optical gain and absorption. In this work, a narrow-gap semiconductor, $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$, is demonstrated to exhibit an optical response $>10\times$ larger than that of $\rm Hg_{x}Cd_{1-x}Te$ (MCT), the dominant material for FIR/MIR photodetectors. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that chalcogen $p$ and metal $d$ band inversion in this material creates a Mexican hat band structure (MHBS), which results in a dramatic increase in the joint density of states at the optical transition edge compared to typical semiconductors. This prediction is experimentally validated here using single-crystal specimens of $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$ measured using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of $1.7$-$20~\rm \mu m$ ($0.73$-$0.062~\rm eV$). These measurements demonstrate a large enhancement in extinction coefficient and refractive index characteristic of a MHBS in the vicinity of the absorption edge, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The realization of topological semiconductors with a MHBS is expected to lead to high-efficiency detectors operating in the FIR/MID range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Stephan van den Wildenberg, Arghadip Koner, George C. Schatz, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.</p>

            <h2>Fermi-liquid corrections to the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of topological metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Pasqua, Michele Fabrizio</p>
            <p>We show that topological metals lacking time-reversal symmetry have an intrinsic non-quantized component of the anomalous Hall conductivity which is contributed not only by the Berry phase of quasiparticles on the Fermi surface, but also by Fermi-liquid corrections due to the residual interactions among quasiparticles, the Landau f-parametes. These corrections pair up with those that modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one, or the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of states. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for topological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological invariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such corrections are naturally accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory, here extended to the case in which coherence effects between bands crossing the chemical potential and those that are instead away from it play a crucial role, as in the anomalous Hall conductivity, and have important implications when those metals are on the verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Wilhelm Kadow, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provided evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description qualitatively captures our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moiré lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Maeda, Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Bo Lu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</p>

Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyeong Ahn, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry by themselves eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</p>

Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr.

Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2, and show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from neighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various other perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and topological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.</p>

            <p>We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties with electronic band structure calculation of the Bi square net system PrAgBi$_2$. The magnetization and heat capacity data confirm the presence of a crystalline electric field (CEF) effect in PrAgBi$_2$. Analysis of the CEF effect using a multilevel energy scheme reveals that the ground state of PrAgBi$_2$ consists of five singlets and two doublets. The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations data show a single frequency with a very small cyclotron effective mass of approximately 0.11 $m_e$. A nontrivial Berry phase is also observed from the quantum oscillations data. The magnetotransport data shows linear and unsaturated magnetoresistance, reaching up to 1060\% at 2 K and 9 T. Notably, there is a crossover from a weak-field quadratic dependence to a high-field linear dependence in the field-dependent magnetoresistance data. The crossover critical field $B^*$ follows the quadratic temperature dependence, indicating the existence of Dirac fermions. The band structure calculation shows several Dirac-like linear band dispersions near the Fermi level and a Dirac point close to the Fermi level, located at the Brillouin zone boundary. \textit{Ab inito} calculations allowed us to ascribe the observed dHvA oscillation frequency to a particular feature of the Fermi surface. Our study suggests layered PrAgBi$_2$ is a plausible candidate for hosting the CEF effect and Dirac fermion in the Bi square net.</p>

            <p>In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T$_c$s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher Tc should no longer solely be to increase T$_c$ under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$ (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~ 50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~ 4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of ferromagnetism in rippled La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane with process-induced strain prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique</h2>

            <p>Transition metal oxides are a platform for exploring strain-engineered intriguing physical properties and developing spintronic or flexible electronic functionalities owing to strong coupling of spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-induced structural and superconducting transitions in black arsenic</h2>

            <p>We report high-pressure Raman spectra and resistance measurements of black arsenic (b-As) up to 58 GPa, along with phonon density of states (DOS) and enthalpy calculations for four reported arsenic phases up to 50 GPa. It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.</p>

            <h2>Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutaro Nagae, Leo Katayama, Satoshi Ikegaya</p>
            <p>Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been hindered by the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we show that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry known as the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. Furthermore, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</p>

            <p>The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows stepwise resistance dependencies on an applied magnetic field. These resistance steps result from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, exhibit unusual dependence on the magnitude of uniaxial strain $\epsilon$. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal -- strong topological insulator -- trivial dielectric and proves the appearance of the surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1\%$.</p>

            <p>Dielectric structures can support low-absorption optical modes, which are attractive for engineering light-matter interactions with excitonic resonances in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the coupling strength is often limited by the electromagnetic field being confined inside the dielectric, reducing spatial overlap with the active excitonic material. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for enhanced light-matter coupling by embedding excitonic tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) within dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), forming a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that optimizes the field overlap and alignment between excitons and optical waveguide modes. To tailor diffractive coupling between free-space light and the waveguide modes in the vdW heterostructure, we fabricate Fourier surfaces in the top hBN layer using thermal scanning-probe lithography and etching, producing sinusoidal topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. We observe the formation of exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting indicating that the system is at the onset of strong coupling. These results demonstrate the potential of Fourier-tailored vdW heterostructures for exploring advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba1-xKxBiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 > Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.</p>

            <p>Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.</p>

            <p>We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 500 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-1}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism in orthorhombic $Pnma$ structure through group theory and DFT calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Rooj, Sugandha Saxena, Nirmal Ganguli</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetism, initially considered interesting but useless, recently emerged as one of the most promising magnetic phases for technology. Recently, a low symmetry antiferromagnetic phase, known as altermagnetic phase, have been discovered, where no time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is observed in spite of a vanishing net magnetization, leading to non-degenerate bands from the opposite magnetic sublattices. In this work, we consider two representatives of orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group, namely, BiFeO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ and find altermagnetic lowest energy phase in both from our density functional theory calculations. We find a substantial spin-splitting in both systems along a high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone without considering the spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Detailed features of the band dispersion obtained from our calculation confirm the lifting of sublattice spin degeneracy only in the $k_y$-$k_z$ plane while preserving the spin degeneracy in the other planes of the Brillouin zone. We provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the magnetic space group (MSG) to explain our DFT findings and an insightful symmetry-allowed model Hamiltonian, which qualitatively agrees with our results. Additionally, we extend our symmetry analysis to encompass two other potential MSGs within the $Pnma$ space group that may host the spin-splitting phenomenon without considering SOI and the likely form of their Hamiltonian. These detailed studies pave the way for a deeper understanding of the spin-splitting phenomena within the $Pnma$ space group, offering insights into the intricate interplay between symmetry and electronic as well as magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon interactions in thermal Hall physics.</p>

            <p>Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Xiao, Masahiro O. Takahashi, Paul Stevenson, Satoshi Fujimoto, Arun Bansil</p>
            <p>Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</p>

            <p>T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</p>

            <p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p>

            <p>Ab initio downfolding describes the electronic structure of materials within a low-energy subspace, often around the Fermi level. Typically starting from mean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and two-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian representing the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such Hamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated materials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab initio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range interactions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts for all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of the range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is readily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach to polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both short-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the magnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the static limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for MgO, and by 79% for GeTe. Our framework also predicts that overall attractive nearest-neighbor interactions arise between electrons in GeTe, consistent with superconductivity in this material.</p>

            <p>We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</p>

            <p>In easy-plane magnets, the spin-superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin-superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID) -- inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of the electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency of the harmonic modes.</p>

            <p>When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Due to the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Polarizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He</p>
            <p>Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This polarization arises from the momentum-dependent spin splitting, which is unique to altermagnets, and which induces a momentum-dependent optical intersite spin transfer effect. Furthermore, the ferrimagnetic polarization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. The excitation along the spin-polarized planes breaks the symmetry of the momentum-space magnetization distribution, leading to inequivalent spin-resolved charge transfer between sublattices across both momentum and real space. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferri-magnetic state.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Qi Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p>

            <h2>(Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quintin N. Meier, Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer, Andrés Cano</p>
            <p>Altermagnets form a subclass of collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. Here, we introduce the Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including the perovskite SrCrO$_3$) as candidates for antiferromagnetic materials in which altermagnetism emerges from spontaneous orbital ordering, rather than crystal symmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we identify a layer-dependent spin splitting of the electronic states, driven by the interplay between spin and orbital order. We show that if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits a net spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe an anti-altermagnetic state where layerwise compensation leads to net zero spin splitting. We find that for odd $n$, altermagnetic and anti-altermagnetic phases can coexist, whereas for even $n$ and in the perovskite limit, the system remains strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, increasing $n$ favors metallicity. Finally, we indicate that in odd $n$ compounds, epitaxial strain can promote the altermagnetic phase.</p>

            <p>We report the magnetic, magnetodielectric, and electric polarization properties of single crystals of the Co-based Kitaev Spin Liquid (KSL) candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ (NCTO). The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.</p>

            <p>We study the particle-scale motion of highly polydisperse hard disks flowing in a two-dimensional bent channel. We use various size distributions of particles, in which the largest particles are up to five times larger than the smallest. The disks are pushed through an L-shaped channel to drive the particle rearrangements. Although the mean flow is essentially independent of the polydispersity, the motion of individual particles becomes more nonaffine on average for higher polydispersity samples. We characterize the nonaffine motion, finding a qualitative difference in the behavior of small and larger particles: the smaller disks have more nonaffine motion, induced by the larger particles.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Mohammadagha, Mohammad Najafi, Vinayak Kaushal, Ahmad Mahmoud Ahmad Jibreen</p>
            <p>The aging sewer infrastructure in the U.S., covering 2.1 million kilometers, encounters increasing structural issues, resulting in around 75,000 yearly sanitary sewer overflows that present serious economic, environmental, and public health hazards. Conventional inspection techniques and deterministic models do not account for the unpredictable nature of sewer decline, whereas probabilistic methods depend on extensive historical data, which is frequently lacking or incomplete. This research intends to enhance predictive accuracy for the condition of sewer pipelines through machine learning models artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) by integrating factors such as pipe age, material, diameter, environmental influences, and PACP ratings. ANNs utilized ReLU activation functions and Adam optimization, whereas MLR applied regularization to address multicollinearity, with both models assessed through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. The findings indicated that ANNs surpassed MLR, attaining an R2 of 0.9066 compared to MLRs 0.8474, successfully modeling nonlinear relationships while preserving generalization. MLR, on the other hand, offered enhanced interpretability by pinpointing significant predictors such as residual buildup. As a result, pipeline degradation is driven by pipe length, age, and pipe diameter as key predictors, while depth, soil type, and segment show minimal influence in this analysis. Future studies ought to prioritize hybrid models that merge the accuracy of ANNs with the interpretability of MLR, incorporating advanced methods such as SHAP analysis and transfer learning to improve scalability in managing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.I. Yukalov, S. Gluzman</p>
            <p>One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.</p>

We also talk about other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can also find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</p>

            <p>Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) based on spin-1/2 fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) are considered on the square lattice. First, fPEPS approximants of Gutzwiller-projected Chern insulators (GPCI) are investigated by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques on finite size tori. We show that such fPEPS of finite bond dimension can correctly capture the topological properties of the chiral spin liquid, as the exact GPCI, with the correct topological ground state degeneracy on the torus. Further, more general fPEPS are considered and optimized (on the infinite plane) to describe the CSL phase of a chiral frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The chiral modes are computed on the edge of a semi-infinite cylinder (of finite circumference) and shown to follow the predictions from Conformal Field Theory. In contrast to their bosonic analogs the (optimized) fPEPS do not suffer from the replication of the chiral edge mode in the odd topological sector.</p>

            <p>Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.</p>

Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures.

Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</p>

            <p>In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical tree structures are common in many real-world systems, from tree roots and branches to neuronal dendrites and biologically inspired artificial neural networks, as well as in technological networks for organizing and searching complex datasets of high-dimensional patterns. Within the class of hierarchical self-organized systems, we investigate the interplay of structure and function, associated with the emergence of complex tree structures in disordered environments. Using an algorithm that creates and searches trees of real-world patterns, our work stands at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and network theory. We resolve the network properties over multiple phase transitions and across a continuity of scales, using the von Neumann entropy, its generalized susceptibility, and the recent definition of thermodynamic-like quantities, such as work, heat, and efficiency. We show that scale-invariance, i.e. power-law Laplacian spectral density, is a key feature to construct trees capable of combining fast information flow and sufficiently rich internal representation of information, enabling the system to achieve its functional task efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of the environmental conditions the system has adapted to is encoded in the value of the exponent of the power-law spectral density, inherently related to the network spectral dimension, and directly influencing the traits of those functionally efficient networks. Thereby, we provide a novel metric to estimate the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.</p>

The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance.

            <p>Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit unique properties, expanding opportunities in material design. We investigate MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) in homo- and heterobilayers with different stacking and twist angles. Twisted bilayers introduce Moiré patterns, significantly altering electronic properties. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap, highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree, 77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers yield symmetric Moiré patterns with tunable band gaps. Our findings emphasize that controlling heterostructures and twist angles is a powerful strategy for engineering electronic properties, offering a pathway for next-generation materials.</p>

Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations can be controlled by the drive.

            <p>Since Newton's time, deterministic causality has been considered a crucial prerequisite in any fundamental theory in physics. In contrast, the present work investigates stochastic dynamical models for motion in one spatial dimension, in which Newtonian mechanics becomes an emergent property: We present a coherent theory in which a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) emerges in a description of the evolution of entropy $-\phi(x,t)=\epsilon \log$(Probability) of a system under observation and in the limit of large information extent $\epsilon^{-1}$ in homogeneous space and time. The variable $\phi$ represents a non-random high-order statistical concept that is distinct from probability itself as $\epsilon=0$; the HJE embodies an emergent law of deterministic causality in continuous space and time with an Imaginary Scale symmetry $(t,x,\phi)\leftrightarrow (it,ix,-i\phi)$. $\phi(x,t)$ exhibits a nonlinear wave phenomenon with a mathematical singularity in finite time, overcoming which we introduce viscosity $\epsilon(\partial^2\phi/\partial x^2)$ and wave $i\epsilon(\partial^2 \phi/\partial x^2)$ perturbations, articulating dissipation and conservation, which break the Imaginary Scale symmetry: They lead to the Brownian motion and Schrödinger's equation of motion, respectively. Last but not least, Lagrange's action in classical mechanics acquires an entropic interpretation and Hamilton's principle is established.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moritz Eissler, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo</p>
            <p>The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</p>

            <h2>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods</p>
            <p>A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Chiara Angelini, Saverio Palazzi, Tommaso Rizzo, Marco Tarzia</p>
            <p>The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</p>

            <h2>Long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Mattes, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo</p>
            <p>Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</p>

            <h2>Mixing by squirmers in stratified fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaseem A. Shaik, Gwynn J. Elfring</p>
            <p>We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Balcerek, Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Agnieszka Wyłomanska, Krzysztof Burnecki, Diego Krapf</p>
            <p>Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</p>

            <h2>Information-entropy-driven generation of material-agnostic datasets for machine-learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Danny Perez</p>
            <p>In contrast to their empirical counterparts, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) promise to deliver near-quantum accuracy over broad regions of configuration space. However, due to their generic functional forms and extreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties of novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set a determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme conditions. We propose a novel automated dataset generation method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the feature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the configuration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific target materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material properties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements with the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), graphite (C), and trigonal (Sb, Te) ground states. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a range of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very broad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or hyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to rapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for simulations in extreme conditions.</p>

            <h2>Minimal work protocols for inertial particles in non-harmonic traps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Sanders, Marco Baldovin, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi</p>
            <p>Progress in miniaturized technology allows us to control physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of a previous work, provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions, corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. The control protocol and the time-dependent position distribution are qualitatively different from the corresponding overdamped limit: in particular, a symmetry of the boundary conditions, which is preserved in the absence of inertia, turns out to be broken in the underdamped regime. We also show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory, except close to the boundary, while the evolution of the position mean and of the second moments is highly non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating the progress of materials prediction and classification, with particular success in CGNN designs. While classical ML methods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to build and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML networks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and optimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps, magnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks easily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To support this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and materials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in quantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an ensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further investigations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpiński gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpiński gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpiński gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</p>

            <h2>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</p>

            <p>Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.</p>

            <p>Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</p>

If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.</p>

            <p>Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By considering fermionic representations of our spin Hamiltonian, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.</p>

            <p>Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</p>

            <p>Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.</p>

            <p>We unravel the existence and stability properties of one-dimensional droplets arising in genuine two-component particle imbalanced bosonic mixtures under the influence of a weak harmonic confinement. A plethora of miscible droplet phases is found with the majority component atoms in the vicinity of the minority ones assembling in a droplet configuration while the remaining excess atoms being in the gas state. Our computations identify a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state for increasing total atom number and fixed interactions, with the bound character being prolonged for stronger intercomponent attractions. Spectral stability of these two-component droplets is revealed by examining their underlying Bogoliubov-de-Gennes excitation spectrum. Furthermore, the collective dynamics associated with the fundamental dipole and breathing modes of the system is monitored by suddenly shifting the trap's center or quenching the trap's frequency, respectively. There, a back action of the significantly localized minority component is imprinted in the majority cloud. The present findings can be simulated in recent cold-atom experiments, thus setting the stage for probing the complex nonequilibrium dynamics of two-component droplets.</p>

            <p>Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</p>

            <p>This article studies the dynamics of the mean-field approximation of continuous random networks. These networks are stochastic integrodifferential equations driven by Gaussian noise. The kernels in the integral operators are realizations of generalized Gaussian random variables. The equation controls the time evolution of a macroscopic state interpreted as neural activity, which depends on position and time. The position is an element of a measurable space. Such a network corresponds to a statistical field theory (STF) given by a momenta-generating functional. Discrete versions of the mentioned networks appeared in spin glasses and as models of artificial neural networks (NNs). Each of these discrete networks corresponds to a lattice SFT, where the action contains a finite number of neurons and two scalar fields for each neuron. In this article, we develop mathematically rigorous, continuous versions of the mean-field theory approximation and the double-copy system that allow us to derive a condition for the criticality of continuous stochastic networks via the largest Lyapunov exponent. We use two basic architectures; in the first one, the space of neurons is the real line, and then the neurons are organized in one layer; in the second one, the space of neurons is the p-adic line, and then the neurons are organized in an infinite, fractal, tree-like structure. We also studied a toy model of a continuous Gaussian network with a continuous phase transition. This behavior matches the critical brain hypothesis, which states that certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</p>

            <p>It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called the mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</p>

            <h2>Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls</h2>

            <p>Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</p>

            <h2>Surface polarization strongly influences electrostatics in a nonlocal medium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Behjatian, Ralf Blossey, Madhavi Krishnan</p>
            <p>Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length, but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.</p>

            <h2>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</h2>

            <p>The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <h2>Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Li, Feng Xue, Xin-Yi Tang, Xiyu Hong, Yang Chen, Xiao Feng, Ke He</p>
            <p>Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.</p>

            <h2>Objective Moir\'e Pattern</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Feng</p>
            <p>Moiré patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moiré patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moiré patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moiré patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moiré patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moiré patterns and facilitate the application of moiré patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</p>

            <p>We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</p>

            <h2>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonhyun Yeo, Haena Shim</p>
            <p>An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</p>

            <p>Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

            <p>We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</p>

            <p>We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <p>Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behaviour of the architecture by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) architectures to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behaviour. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer architecture with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher, when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Crack tip plasticity originated in the metallic Ti layer in TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures increased the total fracture resistance by more than eight-fold compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.</p>

            <p>The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist</p>
            <p>Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</p>

            <h2>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Lorenzetti</p>
            <p>The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</p>

            <p>In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement. We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models</h2>

            <p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods.

            <h2>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in model biological tissues</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh Q. Nguyen, Junxiang Huang, Dapeng Bi</p>
            <p>During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum and Vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, O-Kab Kwon, Hanwool Song, Chanju Kim</p>
            <p>The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</p>

            <h2>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroomi Chono, Hayato Goto</p>
            <p>Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</p>

Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</p>

            <p>Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application of the numerical techniques to solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization using machine learning.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</p>

            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <p>We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.</p>

Our method substantially reduces required cell sizes while maintaining accuracy. Comparisons with experimental gaps and self-consistent $GW$ calculations reveal that deviations in EOM-CCSD predictions correlate with reduced single excitation character of the excited many-electron states. Our work not only provides a computationally tractable approach to EOM-CC calculations in solids but also reveals fundamental insights into the role of single excitations in electronic-structure theory.</p>

            <p>Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</p>

We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel.

            <p>The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p>

            <p>Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</p>

            <p>The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure.

            <h2>Competition between excitonic insulators and quantum Hall states in correlated electron-hole bilayers</h2>

            <p>Excitonic insulators represent a unique quantum phase of matter, providing a rich ground for studying exotic quantum bosonic states. Strongly coupled electron-hole bilayers, which host stable dipolar exciton fluids with an exciton density that can be adjusted electrostatically, offer an ideal platform to investigate correlated excitonic insulators. Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear helicity-dependent photocurrents have been reported in 3D topological materials lacking inversion symmetry. Here, we theoretically study the charge and spin photocurrents generated by linear and circularly polarized radiation in ultrathin topological insulator films. Using time-dependent perturbation theory and detailed balance equations, we find that helical transverse spin currents are generated when the symmetry between the top and bottom film surfaces is disturbed. Such spin currents are invariant under in-plane mirror transformations but have $s$-wave and $d$-wave components in regard to transformations under $\pi/2$ rotations. Spin current photo-transistors and amplifiers can be based on these effects.</p>

            <p>Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter - they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems [1-5], that are generically difficult to simulate classically due to their high entanglement. Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref. [6], image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes, and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</p>

The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal and achieves a position imprecision rivaling optical interferometers.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</p>
            <p>We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

            <p>Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fröhlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</p>

            <p>Spall failure, a complex failure mechanism driven by tensile stress wave interactions, has been extensively studied in single-crystal FCC metals, revealing a precursor stage involving dislocation emission along closed-packed directions. Here we investigate the photo-induced spall failure of Ni bicrystals under a two-pulse laser configuration, exploring various misorientation angles through two-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including electronic effects to simulate light-matter interaction. Our findings demonstrate that light-matter interactions can induce spall failure at the sample center, similar to conventional plate-impact methods, when two laser-pulses are applied to the front and back surfaces of the sample. The study reveals the significant influence of misorientation angles on dislocation activity and spall behavior, where grain boundaries (GBs) play pivotal roles, either promoting or impeding dislocation interactions. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential for enhancing spall resistance by tailoring materials through misorientation angle variation.</p>

            <p>Spin-forbidden ($\Delta S \neq 0$) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) CrI$_3$. Previously unreported spin-forbidden ($\Delta S = 1$) ${}^4A_{2\mathrm{g}} \to{}^2E_\mathrm{g}/{}^2T_{1\mathrm{g}}$ Cr${}^{3+}$ $dd$ excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr$^{3+}$ multiplet character is established through complementary Cr $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements along with charge transfer multiplet (CTM) calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series (CrX$_3$, X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit and exhibit a significant magnetic field tunability across the antiferromagnetic to FM transition in few-layer samples. This behavior is associated to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state, as supported by our CTM analysis. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI$_3$ and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field-tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.</p>

            <p>We investigated the pressure effects of a superconductivity on thin films of Sn. Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with increasing pressure from 3.72 K to 5.3 K with the structural transformation into $\gamma$-Sn around 10 GPa. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.</p>

            <p>Quantized vortices in type-II superconductors provide insights into the mechanisms of superconductivity. However, the generation of antivortices, characterized by magnetization antiparallel to the external magnetic field, remains less understood. In this study, we investigate Sn-Pb solder, a superconductor with phase-separated Sn and Pb phases, and report the observation of both vortices and antivortices. Scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy revealed the presence of both vortices and antivortices, while magneto-optical imaging demonstrated flux avalanches. Our results demonstrate that Sn in Sn-Pb solder behaves as a type-II superconductor when magnetic fluxes are trapped, despite bulk Sn being a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature (TcSn) of 3.7 K. Our findings suggest that the size effect and proximity effect with Pb contribute synergistically to induce type-II superconductivity in Sn Notably, vortices were observed at temperatures as high as 5 K, exceeding the bulk TcSn. Furthermore, the interplay between the type-I superconducting Pb phase and the type-II superconducting Sn phase results in the generation of antivortices, providing a mechanism to accommodate excess magnetic flux. This study shed light on new research on composites combining type-I and type-II superconductors.</p>

            <p>Quantum matter phases may co-exist microscopically even when they display competing tendencies. A fundamental question is whether such a competition can be avoided through the elimination of one phase while the other one condenses into the ground state. Here, we present a high-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of the low-energy spin excitations in the high-temperature superconductor La1.855Sr0.145CuO4. In the normal state, we find low-energy magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate reciprocal lattice positions where spin-density-wave order emerges at lower Sr concentration or at high magnetic fields. While these spin excitations are largely suppressed by the emergence of the superconducting spin gap, some low-energy magnetic fluctuations persist deep inside the superconducting state. We interpret this result in terms of a dynamic competition between superconductivity and magnetism, where superconductivity impedes the condensation of low-energy magnetic fluctuations through the formation of magnetically-mediated Cooper pairs.</p>

            <p>Quantum oscillations in magnetization or resistivity are a defining feature of metals subject to an external magnetic field. The phenomenon is generally not expected in insulators without a Fermi surface. The observations of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulating materials have provided a rare counterexample and attracted much theoretical interest. However, the magnetic oscillations in correlated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations of resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in Coulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows the phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk materials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be comparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions between excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states are observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding energy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb drag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular momentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory calculations. The study demonstrates a new platform for studying quantum oscillations in correlated insulators.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.</p>

In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</p>

            <p>We propose a non-volatile memory element based on a lateral ferromagnetic Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane magnetization. The interplay between the latter and the intrinsic exchange field of the ferromagnet leads to a magnetoelectric effect that couples the charge current through the junction and its magnetization, such that by applying a current pulse the direction of the magnetic moment in F can be switched. The two memory states are encoded in the direction of the out-of-plane magnetization. With the aim to determine the optimal working temperature for the memory element, we explore the noise-induced effects on the averaged stationary magnetization by taking into account thermal fluctuations affecting both the Josephson phase and the magnetic moment dynamics. We investigate the switching process as a function of intrinsic parameters of the ferromagnet, such as the Gilbert damping and strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and proposed a non-destructive readout scheme based on a dc-SQUID. Additionally, we analyze a way to protect the memory state from external perturbations by voltage gating in systems with a both linear-in-momentum Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Bloch points using micromagnetic and Heisenberg models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Brian Winkler, Marijan Beg, Martin Lang, Mathias Kläui, Hans Fangohr</p>
            <p>Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations, that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB) model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the -- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used to retain information [1].</p>

            <h2>Omnidirectional domain wall modes protected by fragile topological states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pegah Azizi, Siddhartha Sarkar, Kai Sun, Stefano Gonella</p>
            <p>So-called fragile topological states of matter challenge our conventional notion of topology by lacking the robustness typically associated with topological protection, thereby displaying elusive manifestations that are difficult to harness for wave control. In this Letter, we leverage the recent discovery of fragile topological states in special classes of structural kagome lattices to document the availability of domain wall elastic wave modes that are directly traceable to fragile topology and, yet, exhibit remarkably strong signatures that support omni-directionality. We design twisted kagome bi-domains comprising two topologically distinct sublattices - one trivial and the other fragile topological - sharing a common bandgap and meeting at a domain wall. The two phases are achieved via carefully engineered surface cut patterns that modify the band landscape of the underlying lattices in complementary fashions, leading to dichotomous irreps landscapes. Under these circumstances, a domain wall-bound mode emerges within the shared bandgap and displays remarkable stability against domain wall orientation and introduced defects. We corroborate these findings via $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian and Jackiw-Rabbi analysis and validate them experimentally through laser vibrometry tests on a prototype endowed with water jet-induced perforation patterns.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Gaggioli, Yasen Hou, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, Akashdeep Kamra</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets; interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Brevitt, Alexander Schulz, Dominic Pegler, Holger Kantz, Rainer Klages</p>
            <p>Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</p>

            <h2>Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Taravati</p>
            <p>The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</p>

At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.</p>

            <h2>Electrically tunable Floquet Weyl photon emission from Dirac semimetal Cd3As2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobhan Subhra Mishra, Thomas CaiWei Tan, Manoj Gupta, Faxian Xiu, Ranjan Singh</p>
            <p>The ability to optically engineer the Dirac band and electrically control the Fermi level in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac systems, such as graphene, has significantly advanced quantum technologies. However, similar tunability has remained elusive in three-dimensional Dirac systems. In this work, we demonstrate both optical and electrical tunability of the band structure in the 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Photoexcitation with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracy at Dirac points to transform the material into a Floquet Weyl semimetal with chiral Weyl nodes. This transition induces nonzero Berry curvature, giving rise to helicity-dependent transverse anomalous photocurrents, detectable through terahertz emission at normal incidence. Furthermore, applying an external electric field displaces the Fermi level away from the Dirac point, enlarging the Dirac cone projection leading to a reduced density of states of Fermi arcs. As a result, we achieve precise electrical control over Floquet band engineering, resulting in a large modulation of THz emission. Moreover, at oblique incidence, the circular photon-drag effect induces helicity-dependent longitudinal photocurrents. Simultaneous generation and manipulation of both longitudinal and transverse photocurrents enable precise control of the helicity of emitted THz pulses. These results pave the way for electric field-controlled Floquet Weyl THz sources, offering significant potential for applications in quantum computing and low-power electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Logan Blackham, Arshath Manjalingal, Saeed R. Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal</p>
            <p>We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhefeng Lou, Zhihao Gong, Ziye Zhu, Wenbin Li, Xiao Lin, Hua Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials with giant nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are essential for the development of advanced on-chip NLO devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D semiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of Bi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest values reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from gauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift vector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning drives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a polar metal. Our findings present a unique platform that combines strain-tunable bandgap engineering with exceptional NLO properties, while also highlighting the crucial role of quantum geometry in enhancing SHG.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Bishnu Karki, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Dupuis, Moksh Bhateja, Adam Rançon</p>
            <p>We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Liu, Hongyi Sun, Ming Zhang, Qihang Liu, Wei-Qiang Chen, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory (DFT) band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector $Q\approx(0,0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From view in the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to $Q_0\approx(0.42\pi,0.42\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by FS-nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ considerably lower than that under high pressure, which is consistent with experiments. Furthermore, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC in the material.</p>

            <h2>A Micromechanical Model for Light-interactive Molecular Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devesh Tiwari, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna</p>
            <p>Molecular crystals respond to a light stimulus by bending, twisting, rolling, jumping, or other kinematic behaviors. These behaviors are known to be affected by, among others, the intensity of the incident light, the aspect ratios of crystal geometries, and the volume changes accompanying phase transformation. While these factors, individually, explain the increase in internal energy of the system and its subsequent minimization through macroscopic deformation, they do not fully explain the diversity of deformations observed in molecular crystals. Here, we propose a micromechanical model based on the Cauchy-Born rule and photoreaction theory to predict the macroscopic response in molecular crystals. By accounting for lattice geometry changes and microstructural patterns that emerge during phase transformation, we predict a range of deformations in a representative molecular crystal (salicylideneamine). Doing so, we find that the interplay between photoexcited states and the energy minimization pathways, across a multi-well energy landscape, is crucial to the bending and twisting deformations. We use our model to analyze the role of particle geometries and the intensity of incident light on macroscopic deformation, and identify geometric regimes for shearing and twisting deformations in salicylideneamine crystals. Our micromechanical model is general and can be adapted to predict photomechanical deformation in other molecular crystals undergoing a solid-to-solid phase change and has potential as a computational design tool to engineer reversible and controllable actuation in molecular crystals.</p>

Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we show that \ce{Zr} doping at 3\% and 7\% significantly enhances HER activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5-4.5~eV and achieving near-zero Gibbs free energy (\dgh) values of 0.18-0.16~eV, conditions ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis reveals substantial charge redistribution with enhanced electron accumulation at \ce{Zr} and \ce{N} sites, further driving catalytic performance. This synergy between optimized electronic structure and catalytic properties establishes \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metals for HER. By combining exceptional catalytic efficiency with scalability, our work positions \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as a breakthrough for green hydrogen production, offering a robust pathway toward renewable energy technologies and advancing the design of next-generation non-precious metal catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Charge density wave modulated third-order nonlinear Hall effect in 1$T$-VSe$_2$ nanosheets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Hui Chen, Xin Liao, Jing-Wei Dong, Xing-Yu Liu, Tong-Yang Zhao, Dong Li, An-Qi Wang, Zhi-Min Liao</p>
            <p>We report the observation of a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) in 1$T$-phase VSe$_2$ nanosheets, synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The nanosheets exhibit a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $\sim$77 K. Detailed angle-resolved and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a strong cubic relationship between the third-harmonic Hall voltage $V_{3\omega}^\perp$ and the bias current $I_\omega$, persisting up to room temperature. Notably, the third-order NLHE demonstrates a twofold angular dependence and significant enhancement below the CDW transition temperature, indicative of threefold symmetry breaking in the CDW phase. Scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic contribution from the Berry connection polarizability tensor is substantially increased in the CDW phase, while extrinsic effects dominate at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDW-induced symmetry breaking in modulating quantum geometric properties and nonlinear transport phenomena in VSe$_2$, paving the way for future explorations in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Spin nematic order and superconductivity in $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on square lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sho Uraga, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We investigate competition and cooperation of magnetic frustration and the Kondo effect in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on the square lattice at zero temperature. In this model, the frustrated interactions $J_1,J_2$ between the localized spins stabilize spin nematic orders, while the Kondo coupling favors local spin singlets. Using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small Kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. On the other hand, a standard Fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong Kondo interactions. Furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate Kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the Kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. We discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum spin liquids (QSL) and chemical doping in such materials to explore superconductivity have continuously attracted intense interest. Here, we report the discovery of a potential QSL candidate, pyrochlore-lattice beta-NaYbO2. Colorless and transparent NaYbO2 single crystals, layered alpha-NaYbO2 (~250 um on edge) and octahedral beta-NaYbO2 (~50 um on edge), were grown for the first time. Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.</p>

            <p>It is well known that the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) arises from the integration of the non-zero Berry curvature (BC), conventionally observed in the Dirac/Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. Moreover, nodal surface semimetals are expected to exhibit more significant BC under the prevalence of degenerate points near the Fermi level. In this work, we report the detection of a giant AHE in the Kagome magnet Fe$_3$Ge with a two-dimensional (2D) nodal surface (NS) at $k_{z}=\pi$ plane, exhibiting an anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 160 K, the highest among all reported Kagome topological materials. This finding suggests a new platform for searching large AHC materials and facilitates potential room-temperature applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutan Zhang, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Thomas A. Maier, Steven Johnston, Richard Scalettar</p>
            <p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p>

            <p>We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor material with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.</p>

            <p>The optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Herein, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using the group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers novel characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be further extended to other Floquet systems.</p>

            <p>We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>The geometric impact of the quantum Hall interface on a cone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Li, Qi Li, Zi-Xiang Hu</p>
            <p>Recently, quantum Hall interface has become a popular subject of research; distinct from that of the quantum Hall edge, which is constrained by external background confinement, the interface has the freedom to move, likely towards a string-like state. In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has an extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk. In this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall interface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more easily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the cone angle parameter $\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall interface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction. Moreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution to the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.</p>

However, existing works for advanced technology transistors use simplified empirical models to calculate effective thermal conductivity in the simulations. In this work, we present a dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity with electron and phonon properties extracted from ab initio computations. Absolute in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity data of eight semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, GaN, AlN, 4H-SiC, GaAs, InAs, BAs) and four metallic materials (Al, W, TiN, Ti) with the characteristic length ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers have been provided. Besides the absolute value, normalized effective thermal conductivity is also given, in case it needs to be used with updated bulk thermal conductivity in the future.

            <p>Magnons possess the ability to transport spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials, a characteristic that sets them apart from traditional electronics where power consumption arises from the movement of electrons. However, the practical application of magnon devices demands room temperature operation and low switching power of perpendicular magnetization. Here we demonstrate the low-power manipulation of perpendicular magnetization via magnon torques in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB devices at room temperature. Topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits a high spin Hall conductivity of $\sigma_s \approx 6.1\times 10^4 (\hbar/2e)\cdot (\Omega \cdot m)^{-1}$, which facilitates the generation of magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator NiO. The magnon currents traverse the 20-nm-thick NiO layer and subsequently exert magnon torques on the adjacent ferromagnetic layer, leading to magnetization switching. Notably, we achieve a 22-fold reduction in power consumption in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB heterostructures compared to Bi2Te3/NiO/CoFeB control samples. Our findings establish the low-power perpendicular magnetization manipulation through magnon torques, significantly expanding the range of topological materials with practical applications.</p>

            <p>YBa2Cu3Ox, the first superconductor discovered with Tc higher than 77 K, is among the most complex cuprates having both CuO chains and plains in the structure. YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) exhibits slightly overdoped behavior and further doping is difficult as all the lattice sites in the CuO chains are occupied. We have grown high quality single crystalline films of YBCO and bilayer La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/YBCO exhibiting superconductivity in both the cases. Photoemission spectra reveal different surface and bulk electronic structures; the difference reduces in the bilayer. Evidence of charge transfer across the bilayer interface is observed in the valence band and core level spectra indicating an overdoped condition in YBCO. While superconductivity in the presence of magnetic order in the bilayer is puzzling, this pathway to reach overdoped regime in YBCO opens up a new landscape to probe the exotic physics of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7 with a transition temperature of approximately 80 K above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has sparked significant attention. It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity.

This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</p>

Our study examines four Pt-YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples with varying $\delta$ (0.12 $\leq \delta \leq$ 0.56) using voltage-current measurements across a temperature range. We successfully model the electrical behavior using a Poole-Frenkel conduction framework, revealing that oxygen vacancies create potential wells that trap carriers, directly influencing conduction. We observe that the energy of these traps increases as $\delta$ rises, in agreement with a peak previously detected in optical conductivity measurements. This result supports earlier interpretations, strengthening the proposed connection between oxygen vacancies and the ionization energy associated with impurity bands in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$.</p>

We show that both DMET and QDET accurately describe the ground state and low-lying excited states of the defect, and that TDDFT yields photoluminescence spectra in agreement with experiments. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the convergence of our results as a function of the active space used in the embedding methods, thus defining a protocol to obtain converged data, directly comparable with experiments.</p>

A key finding is a universal scaling behavior, leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions at late times. Our results suggest that the key features of our dynamic theory are generic and apply to the broader class of multi-component systems with conservation laws and active chemical reactions.</p>

In this review of shape-morphing metamaterials, we examine the current state of the field and propose a unified classification system for the mechanisms involved, as well as the design principles underlying them. Specifically, we explore two main categories of unit cells-those that exploit structural anisotropy or internal rotations-and two potential approaches to tessellating these cells: based on kinematic compatibility or geometric frustration. We conclude by discussing the available design tools and highlighting emerging challenges in the development of shape-morphing metamaterials.</p>

            <p>Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</p>

            <p>Micromagnetic modeling is employed to optimize the design of artificial synapse devices based on the spin-orbit-torque (SOT) driven domain wall (DW) motion along a nanotrack with triangular notches. Key attributes, such as the thermal stability of the pinned DW and depinning currents, are obtained for varied nanotrack geometry and pinning strength. Depinning probability as a function of SOT current density and pulse width is studied using finite temperature micromagnetic simulations for varying pinning potential. Results show that wider notches provide better thermal stability - depinning current trade-off. On the other hand, narrow notches exhibit less variation in the depinning times at finite temperatures. It is observed that the DW position can be set precisely to any desired location by the SOT current pulse if the thermal stability is sufficiently high. It is also observed that the meta-plastic functionality can be obtained by adding notches of progressively higher depinning currents along the rectangular nanotrack.</p>

            <h2>A Tale of Two Sides of Wafer: Physical Implementation and Block-Level PPA on Flip FET with Dual-sided Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Lu, Xun Jiang, Yanbang Chu, Ziqiao Xu, Rui Guo, Wanyue Peng, Yibo Lin, Runsheng Wang, Heng Wu, Ru Huang</p>
            <p>As the conventional scaling of logic devices comes to an end, functional wafer backside and 3D transistor stacking are consensus for next-generation logic technology, offering considerable design space extension for powers, signals or even devices on the wafer backside. The Flip FET (FFET), a novel transistor architecture combining 3D transistor stacking and fully functional wafer backside, was recently proposed. With symmetric dual-sided standard cell design, the FFET can deliver around 12.5% cell area scaling and faster but more energy-efficient libraries beyond other stacked transistor technologies such as CFET. Besides, thanks to the novel cell design with dual-sided pins, the FFET supports dual-sided signal routing, delivering better routability and larger backside design space. In this work, we demonstrated a comprehensive FFET evaluation framework considering physical implementation and block-level power-performance-area (PPA) assessment for the first time, in which key functions are dual-sided routing and dual-sided RC extraction. A 32-bit RISC-V core was used for the evaluation here. Compared to the CFET with single-sided signals, the FFET with single-sided signals achieved 23.3% post-P&R core area reduction, 25.0% higher frequency and 11.9% lower power at the same utilization, and 16.0 % higher frequency at the same core area. Meanwhile, the FFET supports dual-sided signals, which can further benefit more from flexible allocation of cell input pins on both sides. By optimizing the input pin density and BEOL routing layer number on each side, 10.6% frequency gain was realized without power degradation compared to the one with single-sided signal routing. Moreover, the routability and power efficiency of FFET barely degrades even with the routing layer number reduced from 12 to 5 on each side, validating the great space for cost-friendly design enabled by FFET.</p>

            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional chains of atoms can be effectively described by one-dimensional Dirac-type equation. Crystal structure of the chain is reflected by pseudo-spin of the quasi-particles. In the article, we present a simple framework where supersymmetric transformation is utilized to generate an interaction between two, initially non-interacting systems described by pseudo-spin-one Dirac-type equation. In the presented example, the transformation converts two asymptotically non-interacting atomic chains into a saw chain locally. The model possesses a flat band whose energy can be fine-tuned deliberately.</p>

            <h2>Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Schnaubelt, Andrea Vitrano, Mariusz Wozniak, Emmanuele Ravaioli, Arjan Verweij, Sebastian Schöps</p>
            <p>Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.</p>

            <p>Copper is one of the most extensively studied materials for energy conversion and catalytic systems, with a wide range of other applications from nanophotonics to biotechnology. However, existing synthesis methods are limited with many undesirable by-products and poorly defined morphologies. Here, we report a surfactant-free on-substrate wet synthesis approach that yields monocrystalline metallic Cu microflakes with (111) crystalline exposed surface. By systematically studying the growth mechanism, we achieve unprecedented sizes of more than 130 {\mu}m, which is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in most previous studies, along with higher aspect ratios of over 400. Furthermore, we show distinctly higher stability against oxidation provided by the halide adlayer. Overall, our facile synthesis approach delivers an exciting venue for the emerging fields of catalysis and nanophotonics.</p>

            <h2>Sharp low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noé Blassel, Tony Lelièvre, Gabriel Stoltz</p>
            <p>We derive novel sharp low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide sharp estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring--Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsaneh L. Sanati, Timur Nikitin, Rui Fausto, Carmel Majidi, Mahmoud Tavakoli</p>
            <p>Energy storage devices with liquid_metal electrodes have attracted interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self_healing, dendrite_free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2. This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim N. Chernodub</p>
            <p>We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This conclusion is supported by the observation by Unruh and Weiss that thermal correlation functions computed at a temperature equal to the Unruh temperature are identical to the corresponding correlation functions in a Minkowski (zero-temperature) vacuum. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the uniform acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation and increases the critical temperature of the chiral transition. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Ayaka Sakata</p>
            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Trachenko</p>
            <p>We review fundamental problems involved in liquid theory including both classical and quantum liquids. Understanding classical liquids involves exploring details of their microscopic dynamics and its consequences. Here, we apply the same general idea to quantum liquids. We discuss momentum condensation in liquid helium which is consistent with microscopic dynamics in liquids and high mobility of liquid atoms. We propose that mobile transit atoms accumulate in the finite-energy state where the transit speed is close to the speed of sound. In this state, the transit energy is close to the zero-point energy. In momentum space, the accumulation operates on a sphere with the radius set by interatomic spacing and corresponds to zero net momentum. We show that this picture is supported by experiments, including the kinetic energy of helium atoms below the superfluid transition and sharp peaks of scattered intensity at predicted energy. We discuss the implications of this picture including the macroscopic wave function and superfluidity. The superfluid transition temperature is evaluated to be within 15% of the experimental value.</p>

            <p>Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.</p>

            <p>The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum antiferromagnetic (AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder, besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry. These results are consistent with recent numerical simulations on the boundary critical behavior of 2D quantum spin models.</p>

            <h2>Minimum-dissipation principle for synchronised stochastic oscillators far from equilibrium</h2>

            <p>We prove a linear stability-dissipation relation (SDR) for $q$-state Potts models driven far from equilibrium by a nonconservative force. At a critical coupling strength, these models exhibit a synchronisation transition from a decoherent into a synchronised state. In the vicinity of this transition, the SDR connects the entropy production rate per oscillator to the phase-space contraction rate, a measure of stability, in a simple way. For large but finite systems, we argue that the SDR implies a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts models as the dynamics selects stable non-equilibrium states with least dissipation. This principle holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium, for any stochastic dynamics, and for all $q$.</p>

            <h2>Noncollinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a low-momentum peak and a diffuse tail for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, the pattern sharpens into a peak indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they give rise to a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=\pi/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=\pi/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic fields.</p>

In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.</p>

Using flavor-wave theory, we compute the excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional SU(3) model and show that it exhibits magnon bands with altermagnetic splitting according to magnetic quantum numbers; we connect this quantum-number splitting to the frequently used concept of magnon chirality. We also compute the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands.</p>

            <p>Predicting the strength of materials requires considering various length and time scales, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Peierls stress measures material strength by evaluating dislocation resistance to plastic flow, reliant on elastic lattice responses and crystal slip energy landscape. Computational challenges due to the non-local and non-equilibrium nature of dislocations prohibit Peierls stress evaluation from state-of-the-art material databases. We propose a data-driven framework that leverages neural networks trained on force field simulations to understand crystal plasticity physics, predicting Peierls stress from material parameters derived via density functional theory computations, which are otherwise computationally intensive for direct dislocation modeling. This physics transfer approach successfully screen the strength of metallic alloys from a limited number of single-point calculations with chemical accuracy. Guided by these predictions, we fabricate high-strength binary alloys previously unexplored, utilizing high-throughput ion beam deposition techniques. The framework extends to problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma in general by harnessing the hierarchy of physics of multiscale models in materials sciences.</p>

            <p>The high coercive field ($\mathcal{E}_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $\mathcal{E}_c$, especially those related to domain nucleation in the Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model and domain wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibas (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant $\mathcal{E}_c$ in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultra-thin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ is 0.1 MV/cm arsing from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower $\mathcal{E}_c$ is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV/cm in a 60 nm ferroelectric (HfO$_2$)$_n$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ ($n=3$ unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low-$\mathcal{E}_c$ devices.</p>

            <p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Ilya Tokatly</p>
            <p>We present an effective field theory for a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints -- charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh non-linear $\sigma$ model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and quantum transport equations which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.</p>

            <h2>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Nakazawa, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to the dilute impurities.</p>

            <h2>Comparison of superconducting pairing in doped cuprates and nickelates within an extended Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yicheng Xiong, Hang Ma, Hongxing Liu, Runyu Ma, Tianxing Ma</p>
            <p>Within a Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprate superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</p>

            <h2>Lindblad quantum dynamics from correlation functions of classical spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Kraft, Mariel Kempa, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg</p>
            <p>The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanghao Zhouyin, Zixi Gan, MingKang Liu, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Linfeng Zhang, Qiangqiang Gu</p>
            <p>Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for material science. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design for equivariant representations of quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependency without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution and invariant overlap parameterization, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</p>

            <p>We solve a model of electrons with Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion and a random Yukawa coupling to a two-dimensional bosonic bath, using an extended dynamical mean field theory scheme. Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which the repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the effects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading to a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal with `Planckian' ($\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low temperatures $T\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that occurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in the strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange metallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for instance, in recent experiments on certain moiré materials.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick J. Ledwith, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibits quantum anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, these bands have concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy resembling local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier states? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for these bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wavefunctions that closely approximate those of the BM model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at $\Gamma$, generating a small parameter $s$ that yields analytic tractability. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are non-local due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We further develop a diagrammatic expansion in which the self energy can be computed exactly to leading order in $s^2$ in the fluctuating moment regime. At charge neutrality, we find a "Mott semimetal", with large flavor entropy and a Mott gap everywhere in the BZ except for the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. Away from neutrality, the Mott semimetal gaps out in a spectrally imbalanced manner, with one Mott band having zero $Z_k$ at the $\Gamma$ point. The model accurately reproduces results from finite temperature thermodynamic measurements, leads to new experimental predictions, and resolves the problem of the emergence of Hubbard physics in isolated topological bands.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihe Yang, Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu</p>
            <p>The interplay between topological localization and non-Hermiticity localization in non-Hermitian crystal systems results in a diversity of shapes of topological edge modes (EMs), offering opportunities to manipulate these modes for potential topological applications. The characterization of the domain of EMs and the engineering of these EMs require detailed information about their wave functions, which conventional calculation of topological invariants cannot provide. In this Letter, by recognizing EMs as specified solutions of eigenequation, we derive their wave functions in an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We then inversely construct a winding tuple $\left \{ w_{\scriptscriptstyle GBZ},w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}\right \} $ that characterizes the existence of EMs and their spatial distribution. Moreover, we define a novel spectral winding number equivalent to $w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}$, which is determined by the product of energies of different bands. The inverse design of topological invariants allows us to categorize the localized nature of EMs even in systems lacking sublattice symmetry, which can facilitate the manipulation and utilization of EMs in the development of novel quantum materials and devices.</p>

            <p>Disordered lattice spin systems are crucial in both theoretical and applied physics. However, understanding their properties poses significant challenges for Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional random-bond Ising model using the recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method. This method generates biased samples from conditional probabilities computed via tensor network contractions and corrects the bias using the Metropolis scheme. Consequently, the proposals provided by tensor networks function as block updates for Monte Carlo simulations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that TNMC simulations can be performed on lattices as large as $1024\times 1024$ spins with moderate computational resources, a substantial increase from the previous maximum size of $64\times 64$ in MCMC. Notably, we observe an almost complete absence of critical slowing down, enabling the efficient collection of unbiased samples and averaging over a large number of random realizations of bond disorders. We successfully pinpoint the multi-critical point along the Nishimori line with significant precision and accurately determined the bulk and surface critical exponents. Our findings suggest that TNMC is a highly efficient algorithm for exploring disordered and frustrated systems in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>We consider Bloch states of weak spacetime-periodic perturbations of homogeneous materials in one spatial dimension. The interplay of space- and time-periodicity leads to an infinitely degenerate dispersion relation in the free case. We consider a general perturbation term, and, as consequence of the infinite degeneracy, we show that the effective equations are given by the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. Our method can be viewed as a time-modulated generalisation of the nearly-free electron model. Based on this result, we find that the infinite degeneracy may split into a family of non-degenerate bands. Our results are illustrated with numerical calculations, and we observe close agreement between the perturbation theory and the numerically computed full solution.</p>

            <p>We derive the macroscopic charge and current densities of a Chern insulator initially occupying its electronic ground state as it responds to a finite-frequency electric field; we use a previously developed formalism based on microscopic polarization and magnetization fields in extended media. In a topologically trivial insulator, our result reduces to the familiar expression for the induced current density in linear response obtained from a Kubo analysis. But for a Chern insulator we find an extra "topological" term involving the (first) Chern number associated with the occupied bands, encoding the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of a frequency-dependent electric field. While an analogous term has been introduced in the "modern theories of polarization and magnetization" for the linear response of finite-sized systems to static electric fields, our expression is valid for bulk Chern insulators in the presence of both static and finite-frequency electric fields, being derived analytically from a microscopic treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom, and can be generalized in a straightforward way to describe the response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields that are not only frequency-dependent but also spatially inhomogeneous.</p>

            <p>Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

            <h2>On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel García Solla</p>
            <p>The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.</p>

The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.</p>

            <p>Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</p>

            <p>Within the canonical ensemble framework, this paper investigates the presence of higher-order transition signals in the $q$-state Potts model (for $q \geq 3$), using two geometric order parameters: isolated spins number and the average perimeter of clusters. Our results confirm that higher-order transitions exist in the Potts model, where the number of isolated spins reliably indicates third-order independent transitions. This signal persists regardless of the system's phase transition order, even at higher values of $q$. In contrast, the average perimeter of clusters, used as an order parameter for detecting third-order dependent transitions, shows that for $q = 6$ and $q = 8$, the signal for third-order dependent transitions disappears, indicating its absence in systems undergoing first-order transitions. These findings are consistent with results from microcanonical inflection-point analysis, further validating the robustness of this approach.</p>

            <p>Extended defects such as dislocation networks and general grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. In this study, we address these challenges by establishing a comprehensive defect genome through empirical interatomic potential-guided sampling. To further enable accurate first-principles calculations on this defect genome, we have developed an automated configuration reconstruction technique. This method transforms defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations through precise atom insertion, utilizing Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals unique plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.</p>

Furthermore, with the advent of compact direct electron detectors (DED) it has been possible to place the detector in a variety of configurations within the SEM chamber. This motivates the present work where we explore the similarities and differences of the different geometries that include on-axis TKD & off-axis TKD using electron transparent samples, as well as more conventional EBSD. Furthermore, we compare these with the newest method called "reflection Kikuchi diffraction" RKD where the sample is placed flat in the chamber and the detector is placed below the pole piece. Through remapping collected diffraction patterns, all these methods can be used to generate an experimental "diffraction sphere" that can be used to explore diffraction from any scattering vector from the unit cell, as well as the ability to perform band profile analysis. This diffraction sphere approach enables us to further probe specific differences between the methods, including for example thickness effects in TKD that can result in the generation of diffraction spots, as well as electron scattering path length effects that result in excess and deficiency variations, as well as inversion of bands in experimental patterns.</p>

            <p>A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</p>

The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

            <h2>Native antisite defects in h-BN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song Li, Pei Li, Adam Gali</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <h2>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Na Wu, Xikun Li, Nathan Goldman, Botao Wang</p>
            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</p>

            <p>Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.</p>

            <p>Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz. Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers. The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.</p>

            <h2>Corrections to the Hamiltonian induced by finite-strength coupling to the environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcin Łobejko, Marek Winczewski, Gerardo Suárez, Robert Alicki, Michał Horodecki</p>
            <p>If a quantum system interacts with the environment, then the Hamiltonian acquires a correction known as the Lamb-shift term. There are two other corrections to the Hamiltonian, related to the stationary state. Namely, the stationary state is to first approximation a Gibbs state with respect to original Hamiltonian. However, if we have finite coupling, then the true stationary state will be different, and regarding it as a Gibbs state to some effective Hamiltonian, one can extract a correction, which is called "steady-state" correction. Alternatively, one can take a static point of view, and consider the reduced state of total equilibrium state, i.e., system plus bath Gibbs state. The extracted Hamiltonian correction is called the "mean-force" correction. This paper presents several analytical results on second-order corrections (in coupling strength) of the three types mentioned above. Instead of the steady state, we focus on a state annihilated by the Liouvillian of the master equation, labeling it as the "quasi-steady state." Specifically, we derive a general formula for the mean-force correction as well as the quasi-steady state and Lamb-shift correction for a general class of master equations. Furthermore, specific formulas for corrections are obtained for the Davies, Bloch-Redfield, and cumulant equation (refined weak coupling). In particular, the cumulant equation serves as a case study of the Liouvillian, featuring a nontrivial fourth-order generator. This generator forms the basis for calculating the diagonal quasi-steady-state correction. We consider spin-boson model as an example, and in addition to using our formulas for corrections, we consider mean-force correction from the reaction-coordinate approach.</p>

            <p>At the interface of Earth's upper and lower mantle, the post-spinel transition boundary controls the dynamics and morphologies of downwelling slabs and upwelling plumes, and its Clapeyron slope is hence one of the most important constraints on mantle convection. In this study, we reported a new in situ experimental dataset on phase stability in Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ at mantle transition zone pressures from laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments, along with a compilation of corrected in situ experimental datasets from the literature. We presented a machine learning framework for high-pressure phase diagram determination and focused on its application to constrain the location and Clapeyron slope of the post-spinel transition: ringwoodite $\leftrightarrow$ bridgmanite + periclase. We found that the post-spinel boundary is nonlinear and its Clapeyron slope varies locally from $-2.3_{-1.4}^{+0.6}$ MPa/K at 1900 K, to $-1.0_{-1.7}^{+1.3}$ MPa/K at 1700 K, and to $0.0_{-2.0}^{+1.7}$ MPa/K at 1500 K. We applied the temperature-dependent post-spinel Clapeyron slope to estimate its lateral variation across the "660-km" seismic discontinuity in subducting slabs and hotspot-associated plumes worldwide, as well as the ambient mantle. We found that, in the present-day mantle, the average post spinel Clapeyron slope in the plumes is three times more negative than that in slabs, and we then discussed the effects of a nonlinear post-spinel transition on the dynamics of Earth's mantle.</p>

            <p>We discuss scalar conformal field theories (CFTs) that can be realized in structural phase transitions. The Landau condition and Lifshitz condition are reviewed, which are necessary conditions for a structural phase transition to be second order. We also review the perturbative analysis in $4-\epsilon$ expansion of the corresponding Landau actions, which were already analyzed thoroughly in the 80s. By identifying the global symmetries of these fixed points, it turns out that in perturbation theory only 6 different CFTs can be realized by commensurate structural phase transitions. ${\rm \textbf{Updated in version 2:}}$ We discuss how to classify all the phases of a Landau theory using the computer algebra system GAP. We also discuss the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, where the Cubic CFT is realized. This is a lecture note based on a series of talks given by the author. The goal of the lecture note is to bridge the gap between condensed matter physicists and conformal field theorists. The note will be further updated in the future.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Noise-Robust Losses for Large-Scale Noisy Data Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Staats, Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow</p>
            <p>Large annotated datasets inevitably contain noisy labels, which poses a major challenge for training deep neural networks as they easily memorize the labels. Noise-robust loss functions have emerged as a notable strategy to counteract this issue, but it remains challenging to create a robust loss function which is not susceptible to underfitting. Through a quantitative approach, this paper explores the limited overlap between the network output at initialization and regions of non-vanishing gradients of bounded loss functions in the initial learning phase. Using these insights, we address underfitting of several noise robust losses with a novel method denoted as logit bias, which adds a real number $\epsilon$ to the logit at the position of the correct class. The logit bias enables these losses to achieve state-of-the-art results, even on datasets like WebVision, consisting of over a million images from 1000 classes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal parameters for several loss functions -- without having to train networks. Remarkably, our method determines the hyperparameters based on the number of classes, resulting in loss functions which require zero dataset or noise-dependent parameters.</p>

            <h2>The Timescales of Quantum Breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Michel, Sebastian Zell</p>
            <p>Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0<\gamma<1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debkanta Ghosh, Keshav Das Agarwal, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.</p>

            <p>We describe a hybrid quantum-classical approach to treat quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCE) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Here, the VQE algorithm is used as a cluster solver within the NLCE. We test our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (NLCE$+$VQE) for the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. The calculation of ground-state energies on each open cluster demands a modified Hamiltonian variational ansatz for the VQE. One major finding is convergence of NLCE$+$VQE to the conventional NLCE result in the thermodynamic limit when at least $N/2$ layers are used in the VQE ansatz for each cluster with $N$ sites. Our approach demonstrates the fruitful connection of techniques known from correlated quantum many-body systems with hybrid algorithms explored on existing quantum-computing devices.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental charges for dual-unitary circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Holden-Dye, Lluis Masanes, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a 1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property, it is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$ conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons - operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local Hilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly, via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits, advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Zhu-Xi Luo</p>
            <p>Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoya Shiota, Kenji Ishihara, Wataru Mizukami</p>
            <p>Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. We established a correlation between LSE and adsorption energies using monometallic systems. Using this correlation in a linear regression model, we successfully estimated molecular adsorption energies on HEAs with significantly higher accuracy than a conventional descriptor (i.e., generalized coordination numbers). Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sabrina Aufiero, Preben Forer, Pierpaolo Vivo, Fabio Caccioli, Silvia Bartolucci</p>
            <p>Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian van Kan</p>
            <p>Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</p>

            <p>The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values, while prioritizing the ability to incorporate dispersion interactions and maintaining low computational cost. We examined Cs salts, Cs oxides, perovskites, caged materials, a borate glass and a cesium fluoroscandate. While no single functional performs equally well for all parameters, the results show rev-vdW-DF2 and PBEsol+D3 to be leading candidates for these systems, in particular with respect to geometry and chemical shifts, which are of high importance for Cs-immobilization matrices.</p>

The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.</p>

            <h2>Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> KVS Chaithanya, Sumesh P. Thampi</p>
            <p>Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.</p>

            <h2>Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Agullo, Adrià Delhom, Álvaro Parra-López</p>
            <p>Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with modest improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>

            <h2>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunling Zhou, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p>

            <p>Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronald Melendrez, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Marcin Szyniszewski, Christopher J. Turner, Arijeet Pal, Hitesh J. Changlani</p>
            <p>Exact solutions of quantum lattice models serve as useful guides for interpreting physical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Prominent examples of integrability appear in one dimension, including the Heisenberg chain, where the Bethe ansatz method has been widely successful. Recent work has noted that certain non-integrable models harbor quantum many-body scar states, which form a superspin of regular states hidden in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. Here we consider one of the simplest examples of a non-integrable model, the alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (bond-staggered) Heisenberg chain, a close cousin of the spin-1 Haldane chain and a spin analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show the presence of exponentially many zero-energy states. We highlight features of the alternating chain that allow treatment with the Bethe ansatz (with important modifications) and surprisingly for a non-integrable system, we find simple compact expressions for zero-energy eigenfunctions for a few magnons including solutions with fractionalized particle momentum. We discuss a general numerical recipe to diagnose the existence of such generalized Bethe ansatz (GBA) states and also provide exact analytic expressions for the entanglement of such states. We conclude by conjecturing a picture of magnon pairing which may generalize to multiple magnons. Our work opens the avenue to describe certain eigenstates of partially integrable systems using the GBA.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhaskar Mukherjee, Christopher J. Turner, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of a manifold of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. We construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates in an exponentially degenerate manifold for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. A symmetric superposition of the triplet basis of antipodal spin pairs provides a rich manifold for the construction of states with extensive, logarithmic, and short-range entanglement by tuning the distribution of triplet states. We show the volume-law entangled states despite being in the middle of the spectrum host non-thermal expectation values of local observables. Certain quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and a novel method of quantum state construction.</p>

            <p>We develop a microscopic theory for excitons and cavity exciton polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers under a perpendicular static magnetic field. We obtain numerically exact solutions for the ground and excited states, accounting for the interplay between arbitrarily large magnetic fields and light-matter coupling strengths. This includes the very strong coupling regime, where light-induced modifications of the exciton wavefunction become essential and the approximate coupled oscillator description breaks down. Our results show excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements of the diamagnetic shift of the ground and excited exciton states in WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$ monolayers. For polaritons, we consider experimentally relevant system parameters and demonstrate that the diamagnetic shifts of both the ground and excited states at high magnetic fields exhibit clear signatures of the very strong coupling regime, highlighting the necessity of our microscopic and numerically exact treatment over perturbative approaches. Furthermore, our microscopic approach allows us to evaluate the exciton-exciton and polariton-polariton interaction strengths. Comparing results specific to TMD monolayers with those applicable to quantum wells, we find that variational approaches overestimate the TMD excitons' interaction strength. We also observe that magnetic fields weaken the interaction strength for both excitons and polaritons, with a less pronounced effect in TMDs than in quantum wells, and that light-induced modifications to the matter component in TMD polaritons can enhance interaction strengths beyond those of purely excitonic interactions.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the single transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical mean-field approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on the thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.</p>

            <p>We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</p>

            <p>Chiral spin liquids (CSL), which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons).

Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_\chi$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magnetoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</p>

            <p>A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared and give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</p>

The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</p>

            <p>We devise a Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout in circuit QED. By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance frequency of the cavity $\omega_{\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection between the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling to photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\parallel$ is controlled by the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\rm q}$, while the dispersive shift $\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two quantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\rm q}\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\omega_{\rm r}\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum curvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static spectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact numerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED systems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal readout.</p>

It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</p>

            <h2>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiichi Iwazaki</p>
            <p>Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</p>

Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <h2>Continuously controllable dissipative and coherent couplings by the interaction between anti-resonance and multiple magnons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenhui Hao, Yuping Yao, Kang An, Xiling Li, Chi Zhang, Guozhi Chai</p>
            <p>Weexperimentally realize the continuously controllable dissipative coupling and coherent coupling induced by different magnon modes and the same anti-resonance. It has been observed that the weaker the microwave magnetic field distribution of the magnon mode in magnetic materials, the more likely dissipative coupling is to occur. Conversely, stronger magnetic field distributions favor coherent coupling. Based on this principle, we have designed and implemented a system that alternates between dissipative and coherent coupling regimes. It allows microwave signals to be selectively transmitted over a large applied magnetic field range at the frequency of anti-resonance. Our experimental achievements may promote the construction of new magnonics devices like magnetic-tuning switch.</p>

            <h2>Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kabir Khanna, Abhishek Kumar, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</p>
            <p>Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.</p>

            <h2>Landau levels in the mixed state of two-dimensional nodal superconductors: models, featured magneto-optical response and quantized thermal Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihai Liu, Bin Wang, Luyang Wang</p>
            <p>Landau quantization of low-energy quasiparticles (QPs) in the mixed state of gapless superconductors is a celebrated problem. So far, the only superconducting system that has been shown to host Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov QPs is the Weyl superconductor. Here, we first investigate the QPs in the mixed state of two Weyl superconductors, an intrinsic one and a heterostructure one, and reveal that the QP states in the former do not form LLs, in contrast to those in the latter where LLs of QPs are shown to exist. The key is whether the low-energy Hamiltonian respects a generalized chiral symmetry. Following the analysis, we show that a twodimensional superconducting system -- a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure respecting the generalized chiral symmetry -- exhibits LLs with Chern number $\pm 1$ in the mixed state. We also show featured responses resulting from the LLs, including peaked magneto-optical conductivity and quantized thermal Hall conductivity, which could be used as experimental probes to detect LLs in superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}>100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.</p>

            <h2>Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional in time-dependent density-functional theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared R. Williams, Carsten A. Ullrich</p>
            <p>Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al., arXiv:2401.16140.</p>

            <p>Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</p>

            <p>Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of >18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</p>

            <h2>Room temperature observation of the anomalous in-plane Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of a Weyl ferromagnet</h2>

            <p>Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.</p>

Wildes, Siddharth S Saxena</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of a polar metal phase in layered van der Waals compound FePSe$_3$. This Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order offers a unique opportunity to fully tune an insulator into a polar metal state with pressure, without doping-induced disorder or impurities. Our synchrotron and neutron diffraction data unambiguously show a structural transition and loss of the inversion symmetry. We also observed the suppression of magnetic ordering and an insulator-to-metal transition correspondent with this structural transformation. The loss of the inversion symmetry combined with the pressure-induced metallicity in FePSe$_3$ offers a new platform to investigate polar metallicity at accessible pressures. Moreover, the high-pressure metallic phase shows unconventional resistivity deviating from the Fermi-liquid description, close to the magnetic critical transition pressure at sufficiently low temperatures, which strongly suggests underlying quantum criticality. Our work not only explores the comprehensive temperature-pressure phase diagram of FePSe$_3$ but also provides insights for further investigation of van der Waals strongly correlated magnetic compounds.</p>

            <p>We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</p>

            <p>Femtosecond laser light can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic subspecies that exhibit hybridized valence bands within an alloy or compound, and represents the fastest route for manipulating the magnetization of a material. To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in terms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by comparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of two very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a sample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and final electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the experimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be included, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or the presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$ phase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal enhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not observed in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers were expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many more available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such signal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a metal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a transiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced spin-transfer signature.</p>

            <p>More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of electrostatic effects of a curved counter-electrode on the emitter field enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago A. de Assis, Fernando F. Dalll'Agnol</p>
            <p>Experiments on field electron emission from single-tip nanoemitters have typically been carried out using a counter-electrode with a finite curvature radius $R$, positioned at a distance $d_{\rm{gap}}$ from the emitter's apex. The effects of the counter-electrode's curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ($\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius $r_{\rm{a}} = 50$nm, is influenced by the curvature of a spherical-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between $10^2$ and $10^3$, there is a universal scaling such that $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}} = \gamma_{\rm{Pa}} \Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$, where $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and $\Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$ is a universal scaling function such that $\Psi \sim 1$ for ${R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \gg 1$ and $\Psi \sim \left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ close to unity, for $ {R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \ll 1$. These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orhtodox field electron emission experiments, who reported that the effective $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$ values extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ values when $R \sim d_{\rm{gap}} \gg r_{\rm{a}}$, a trend that is predicted by our results.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.</p>

Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined.

However, existing mechanisms often depend on weak spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a novel coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization.</p>

            <p>Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.</p>

            <p>The understanding of charge transfer processes in mixed-dimensional quasi-2D perovskites is crucial for their application in high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the link between charge transport dynamics and morphology in a thin film of quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1), grown with a distinct dimensionality gradient, where the n=1 phase is concentrated near the substrate and phases with higher dimensionality progressively increase in concentration toward the surface. By selectively exciting the n=4 phase, we observe efficient hole transfer to the n=2 and n=3 phases occurring within few tens of picoseconds after excitation. In contrast, the n=1 phase acts as a hole-blocking layer, limiting the overall charge transport efficiency. These results emphasize the critical importance of minimizing or eliminating the n=1 layer to enhance charge carrier separation and transport, offering valuable insights into the optimization of quasi-2D perovskite-based solar cells.</p>

            <p>Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.</p>

            <p>We investigate the pressure-driven structural and electronic evolution of PdSe\(_2\) using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Beyond 2.3 GPa, suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion induces in-plane lattice expansion and metallization. Around 4.8 GPa, the interlayer \(d_{z^2}-\pi^*\) orbital hybridization drives the dimensional crossover, facilitating the transformation from the 2D distorted to a 3D undistorted pyrite phase. Above 9 GPa, a novel phase emerges, characterized by octahedral distortions in the $d$ orbitals of Pd. Structural analysis suggests the presence of marcasite (\(Pnnm\)) or arsenopyrite (\(P2_1/c\)) phase with orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations, respectively. Furthermore, the observed phonon anomaly and electronic structure modifications, including the emergence of flat bands in the high-pressure phases, elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the previously reported exotic superconductivity with an enhanced critical temperature. These results highlight the pivotal role of dimensional crossover and structural transitions in tuning the electronic properties of puckered materials, providing pathways for novel functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Weak and strong turbulence in self-focusing and defocusing media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Rosenhaus, Gregory Falkovich</p>
            <p>While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.</p>

We obtain the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and apply the implicit function theorem to it. We show that there is a unique magnetic field (the critical magnetic field) given by a smooth function of the temperature and that there is also a unique nonnegative solution (the gap function) given by a smooth function of both the temperature and the external magnetic field. Using the grand potential, we show that the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a type I superconductor is of the first order. Moreover we obtain the explicit expression for the entropy gap.</p>

            <h2>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ghouli, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis</p>
            <p>The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</p>

            <p>The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the Hénon-Heiles system.</p>

            <p>We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</p>

            <p>Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</p>

            <p>Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heidar Moradi, Ömer M. Aksoy, Jens H. Bardarson, Apoorv Tiwari</p>
            <p>We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so, we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries, realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.</p>

            <p>We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamali Mukherjee, V Satya Narayana Murthy</p>
            <p>Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age, non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co-free layer thickness in the range of 1 nm to 5 nm is taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque help to nucleate skyrmions by transforming the perpendicularly magnetized ground state. This process leads to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via a complex transformation of the Neel wall following its image inversion. Skyrmion numbers vary with increasing thickness as the current density gradually increases. The impact of higher-order anisotropy constants (up to the second order) on the relaxed state of a system, compared to first-order anisotropy alone, has been examined. Additionally, the effect of temperature on the formation of skyrmions has been analyzed for all thicknesses.</p>

            <p>The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</p>

            <p>It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.</p>

            <h2>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Ellison, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</p>

The system is equivalent to an inertial Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential whose center is controlled by a feedback protocol which measures the particle position at a specific sampling frequency $1/{\tau}$. Several feedback protocols are applied and the power generated by the engine is measured as a function of the oscillator parameters and the sampling frequency. The optimal parameters are then determined. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations on overdamped systems. We highlight the specific effects of inertia, which can be used to increase the amount of power extracted by the engine. In the regime of large $\tau$, we show that the produced work has a tight bound determined by information theories.</p>

We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonja Predin</p>
            <p>The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in graphene in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</p>

            <p>We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</p>

            <p>Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</p>

            <p>We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction.

            <h2>Condensate Size Control by Net Charge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengjie Luo, Nathaniel Hess, Dilimulati Aierken, Yicheng Qiang, Jerelle A. Joseph, David Zwicker</p>
            <p>Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising diverse molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Essentially, droplets expel ions, so they cannot screen electrostatics effectively, implying droplets acquire a net charge and cannot grow indefinitely. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</p>

            <h2>Self-organization and memory in an disordered solid subject to random loading</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhittin Mungan, Dheeraj Kumar, Sylvain Patinet, Damien Vandembroucq</p>
            <p>We consider self-organization and memory formation in a mesoscopic model of an amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We develop proper read-out protocols to show that the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range, which can be subsequently retrieved. Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</p>

            <h2>Kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis of the cation incorporation into GeO2, SnO2, and (SnxGe1-x)O2 during suboxide molecular beam epitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenshan Chen, Kingsley Egbo, Joe Kler, Andreas Falkenstein, Jonas Lähnemann, Oliver Bierwagen</p>
            <p>Rutile GeO$_2$ is a promising ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for future power electronic devices whose alloy with the wide bandgap semiconductor rutile-SnO$_2$ enables bandgap engineering and the formation of heterostructure devices. The (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ alloy system is in its infancy and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a well-suited technique for its thin-film growth, yet presents challenges in controlling the alloy composition and growth rate. To understand and mitigate this challenge, the present study comprehensively investigates the kinetics and thermodynamics of suboxide incorporation into GeO$_2$, SnO$_2$, and (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ during suboxide MBE, the latest development in oxide MBE using suboxide sources. We find suboxide MBE to simplify the growth kinetics, offering better control over growth rates than conventional MBE but without supporting cation-driven oxide layer etching. During binary growth, SnO incorporation is kinetically favored due to its higher oxidation efficiency and lower vapor pressure compared to those of GeO. In (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ growth, however, the GeO incorporation is preferred and the SnO incorporation is suppressed, indicating a catalytic effect, where SnO promotes GeO incorporation through cation exchange. The origin of this cation exchange is likely thermodynamic yet calls for further theoretical studies. Our experimental study provides guidance for controlling the growth rate and alloy composition of (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ in suboxide MBE, highlighting the impact of the substrate temperature and active oxygen flux besides that of the mere SnO:GeO flux stoichiometry. The results are likely transferable to further physical and chemical vapor deposition methods, such as conventional and hybrid MBE, pulsed laser deposition, mist- or metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.</p>

            <p>Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can emerge solely from the influence of transport processes that depend on energy levels, voltage polarity, and asymmetries in charge transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our approach provides a fully analytical framework that directly correlates microscopic charge dynamics with macroscopic dielectric responses, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive capability for systems dominated by displacement currents.</p>

            <p>The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a weakly interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.</p>

            <p>ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the fermiology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.</p>

            <p>We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.</p>

            <p>The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</p>

            <p>The infinite-layer nickelates, proposed as analogs to superconducting cuprates, provide a promising platform for exploring the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. However, the superconductivity under atmospheric pressure has only been observed in thin films, indicating the heterointerface is essential. Here, we employed the advanced Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) technique to thoroughly investigate the atomic configuration, layer-resolved electronic states and phonon across the NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface. We found the Sr atoms diffusion at the interface, which results in hole doping into oxygen and nickel band to form a p-type interface. A pronounced redshift of the highest-energy optical phonon (HEOP) of NdNiO2 (~78 meV) is observed at the interface, which is primarily attributed to the epitaxial strain. Our work clarifies that the effects of the interface on electron and phonon states are mainly due to elemental intermixing and epitaxial strain, which could lay the foundation for future investigations into superconducting mechanisms of infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <p>Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</p>

            <p>This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 °C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 °C and 800 °C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.</p>

The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Zhang, Francesco Aiello, Mauro Salazar, Diletta Giuntini</p>
            <p>To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable, especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines these two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar thicknesses.</p>

            <p>Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>We numerically investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and flow inertia on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We perform direct numerical simulations modeling the fibers, suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, as continuous flexible slender bodies obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude that the contact forces and interparticle friction become one of the crucial factors governing the rheology of flexible fiber suspensions at high concentrations.</p>

            <p>Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</p>

Through the use of the Entanglement Forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic Hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present. As an important side product, this method returns the complete energy spectrum and eigenbasis of the system.</p>

            <h2>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Li, Su-Xiang Lyu, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, Xiao Zheng, YiJing Yan</p>
            <p>Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohreh Davoudi, Christopher Jarzynski, Niklas Mueller, Greeshma Oruganti, Connor Powers, Nicole Yunger Halpern</p>
            <p>A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</p>

            <h2>Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies generators and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinkang Guo, Oliver Hart, Chi-Fang Chen, Aaron J. Friedman, Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p>We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" in which measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical and intrinsically quantum ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of dynamical universality classes in open quantum systems, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.</p>
