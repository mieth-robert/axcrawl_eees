            <h2>FFT-Accelerated Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Fermionic Lattice Models: A Determinant-Free Approach with $O(N\log N)$ Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deqian Kong, Shi Feng, Jianwen Xie, Ying Nian Wu</p>
            <p>We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep. Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update. We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Breaking of the SU(3) Flavor Symmetry in a Quantum Hall Valley Nematic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Krizman, A. Kazakov, C.-W. Cho, V. V. Volobuev, A. Majou, E. Ben Achour, T. Wojtowicz, G. Bauer, Y. Guldner, B. A. Piot, Th. Jolicoeur, G. Springholz, L.-A. de Vaulchier</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a SU(3) system.</p>

            <h2>CBVB-nH complexes as prevalent defects in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy-grown hexagonal boron nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marek Maciaszek, Bart≈Çomiej Baur</p>
            <p>Optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates for active components in emerging quantum technologies, such as single-photon emitters and spin centers. However, further progress in hBN-based quantum technologies requires a deeper understanding of the physics and chemistry of hBN defects. In this work, we employ ab initio calculations to investigate the thermodynamic stability and optical properties of defect complexes involving carbon, boron vacancies, and hydrogen. We demonstrate that the formation of CBVB-nH complexes (n from 0 to 3) is energetically favorable under nitrogen-rich conditions in the presence of carbon and hydrogen. The low formation energies and high binding energies of these complexes arise from the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged carbon substitutional defect (CB) and the negatively charged hydrogen-passivated boron vacancies (VB-nH). These complexes are particularly likely to form in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown samples, where growth occurs in the presence of carbon and hydrogen and is accompanied by a high density of boron vacancies. The optical properties of CBVB-nH complexes are analyzed and compared to recent photoluminescence measurements on MOVPE-grown hBN samples. In particular, we investigate the origin of the emission peaks at 1.90 eV and 2.24 eV and demonstrate that both the energies and lineshapes are consistent with hole capture by negatively charged CBVB and CBVB-H complexes.</p>

            <h2>Turn-on of Current-Induced Spin Torque upon Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Ordering in Delafossite PdCrO2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxi Huang, Qi Song, Gautam Gurung, Daniel A. Pharis, Thow Min Jerald Cham, Yulan Chen, Rakshit Jain, Maciej Olszewski, Yufan Feng, Amal El-Ghazaly, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal, Darrell G. Schlom, Daniel C. Ralph</p>
            <p>We report measurements of the current-induced spin torque produced by the delafossite antiferromagnet PdCrO2 and acting on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy layer. The spin torque increases strongly as the temperature is reduced through the Neel temperature, when the PdCrO2 transitions from a paramagnetic phase to a noncollinear antiferromagnetic state. This result is qualitatively consistent with density functional theory calculations regarding how spin-current generation changes upon antiferromagnetic ordering in PdCrO2.</p>

            <h2>DC Current Generation in the Driven Damped Haldane Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konrad Koenigsmann, Peter Schauss, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>The interplay between topological phenomena and nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems represents a rapidly developing frontier in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium steady states of the Haldane model driven by a continuous-wave laser and coupled to a thermal reservoir. Dissipation is modeled within the Lindblad formalism adapted for quadratic fermionic systems, enabling us to study both the relaxation dynamics and the emergence of quasi-steady states. While conventional topological invariants and the bulk-boundary correspondence do not directly apply to such nonequilibrium settings, we introduce an occupation-weighted Chern number that captures the residual topological character of this quasi-steady state. We additionally examine the charge transport of this system under simultaneous driving and damping, showing that inversion symmetry breaking via a staggered sublattice potential generates a finite DC current. The magnitude and direction of this DC current are sensitive to the driving strength, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology, symmetry, and dissipation in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A large spin-splitting altermagnet designed from the hydroxylated MBene monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Yang, Shan-Shan Wang, Shuai Dong</p>
            <p>The development of altermagnets is fundamentally important for advancing spintronic device technology, but remains unpractical for the weak spin splitting in most cases, especially in two-dimensional materials. Based on spin group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, a novel hydroxyl rotation strategy in collinear antiferromagnets has been proposed to design altermagnets. This approach achieves a large chirality-reversible spin splitting exceeding $1130$ meV in $\alpha_{60}$-Mn$_2$B$_2$(OH)$_2$ monolayer. The system also exhibits intrinsic features of a node-line semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Besides, the angles of hydroxyl groups serve as the primary order parameter, which can switch on/off the altermagnetism coupled with the ferroelastic mechanism. The corresponding magnetocrystalline anisotropy have also been modulated. Moreover, an interesting spin-related transport property with the spin-polarized conductivity of 10$^{19}$ $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}s^{-1}$ also emerges. These findings uncover the hydroxyl rotation strategy as a versatile tool for designing altermagnetic node-line semimetals and opening new avenues for achieving exotic chemical and physical characteristics associated with large spin splitting.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Flux-induced Higher-order Topological Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinpeng Xiao, Qianglin Hu, Zuodong Yu, Weipeng Chen, Xiaobing Luo</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuji Hakuno, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p>

            <h2>Multi-orbital Dirac superconductors and their realization of higher-order topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dao-He Ma, Jin An</p>
            <p>Topological nodal superconductors (SCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their gapless bulk excitations and exotic surface states. In this paper, by establishing a general framework of the effective theory for multi-orbital SCs, we realize a class of three-dimensional (3D) time-reversal (T )-invariant Dirac SCs, with their topologically protected gapless Dirac nodes being located at general positions in the Brillouin zone. By introducing T -breaking pairing perturbations, we demonstrate the existence of Majorana hinge modes in these Dirac SCs as evidence of their realization of higher-order topology. We also propose a new kind of T -breaking Dirac SCs, whose Dirac nodes possess nonzero even chiralities and so are characterized by surface Majorana arcs.</p>

            <h2>Electric field-induced spin-valley locking in twisted bilayer buckled honeycomb materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harold J.W. Zandvliet, Pantelis Bampoulis, Cristiane Morais Smith, Lumen Eek</p>
            <p>A twisted honeycomb bilayer exhibits a moir√© superstructure that is composed of a hexagonal arrangement of AB and BA stacked domains separated by domain boundaries. In the case of twisted bilayer graphene, the application of an electric field normal to the bilayer leads to the opening of inverted band gaps in the AB and BA stacked domains. The inverted band gaps result in the formation of a two-dimensional triangular network of counterpropagating valley protected helical domain boundary states, also referred to as the quantum valley Hall effect. Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum valley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex than in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric fields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of freedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a stronger topological protection. For electric fields smaller than the aforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley Hall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is lifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.</p>

            <h2>Linearly polarized light enables chiral edge transport in quasi-2D Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Shafiei, Farhad Fazileh, Milorad V. Milo≈°eviƒá</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering with high-frequency light offers dynamic control over topological phases in quantum materials. While in 3D Dirac systems circularly polarized light is known to induce topological phase transitions via gap opening, linearly polarized light (LPL) has generally been considered ineffective. Here we show that in quasi-2D Dirac materials the second-order momentum term arising from the intersurface coupling can induce a topological phase transition under LPL, leading to chiral edge channels. Considering an ultrathin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film as a representative system, we show that this transition occurs at experimentally accessible light intensities. Our results thus promote quasi-2D materials as viable platforms for light-controlled topological phases, expanding the potential of Floquet topological engineering.</p>

            <h2>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Fukaya, Bo Lu, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>(Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quintin N. Meier, Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer, Andres Cano</p>
            <p>Altermagnets are collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. We introduce Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including SrCrO$_3$) as candidate materials in which altermagnetism can emerge from spontaneous orbital ordering rather than crystal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal a layer-dependent spin splitting: if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe a layerwise uncompensated spin splitting, that is compensated in the adjacent layer, giving rise to the concept of anti-altermagnetism. In the RP series, odd $n$ members support coexistence of altermagnetism and anti-altermagnetism, whereas even $n$ and the perovskite limit are strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, larger $n$ favors metallicity, and in odd $n$ compounds strain can further stabilize altermagnetism.</p>

            <h2>Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Na√Ømo Davier, Flavia A. G√≥mez Albarrac√≠n, H. Diego Rosales, Pierre Pujol, Ludovic D. C. Jaubert</p>
            <p>Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.</p>

            <h2>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Igor Zutic</p>
            <p>Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan S√°nchez-Baena</p>
            <p>We characterize a system of tilted dipoles in a quasi two-dimensional (flattened) geometry and in the thermodynamic limit. We consider a finite trapping in the z-axis achievable in current experiments. We compute the phase diagram of the system at its equilibrium density for high tilting angles, where it becomes self-bound, and a striped liquid state emerges. To characterize the system, we perform a variational calculation, which is benchmarked with the solution of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We connect the phenomenology in the thermodynamic limit to the physics of the finite-size system, provide parameters for the realization of potentially supersolid striped states and study the critical number for dipolar droplet formation. Our results are helpful to guide potential experiments in the study of dipolar atoms in quasi two-dimensional geometries in the dipole-dominated regime.</p>

            <h2>Spin Currents in Rashba Altermagnets: From Equilibrium to Nonlinear Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyadarshini Kapri</p>
            <p>We investigate equilibrium (background), linear, and nonlinear spin currents in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled altermagnet systems, using a modified spin current operator that includes anomalous velocity from non-zero Berry curvature. The background spin current, stemming from spin-orbit coupling and modulated by the altermagnet term ($t_j$), exhibits in-plane polarization, increases linearly with Fermi energy ($\epsilon_F$), and is enhanced by both the altermagnet ($t_j$) and the Rashba parameter ($\lambda$). Linear spin current is always transverse with out-of-plane polarization and can be viewed as Spin Hall current, primarily driven by band velocity, with $t_j$ enabling a band-induced contribution (previously absent in simple Rashba systems ($t_j=0$)). This highlights altermagnet system as a promising source of spin Hall current generation. For linear spin Hall current, its band contribution's magnitude increases linearly with $\epsilon_F$, while the magnitude of anomalous component saturates at higher $\epsilon_F$. Further, the magnitude of spin Hall current is enhanced by $t_j$ but reduced by $\lambda$. Nonlinear spin currents feature both longitudinal and transverse components with in-plane polarization. Both the nonlinear longitudinal spin current from band velocity and the nonlinear transverse spin current from anomalous velocity initially decrease with $\epsilon_F$ before saturating at higher $\epsilon_F$. Importantly, $t_j$ reduces these currents while $\lambda$ enhances them. Meanwhile, the nonlinear transverse current from band velocity increases and then saturates with $\epsilon_F$, enhanced by $\lambda$ and showing non-monotonic variation with $t_j$. These findings highlight the tunability of spin current behavior through Rashba and altermagnet parameters, offering insights for spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadav Shaibe, Jared M. Erb, Steven M. Anlage</p>
            <p>Vortex singularities in speckle patterns formed from random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, meaning they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have applications including sensing, imaging and energy transfer in multiple fields such as optics, acoustics, and elastic or fluid waves. We generalize the concept of speckle patterns to arbitrary parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of various functions of the scattering matrix S, such as Coherent Perfect Absorption, Reflectionless Scattering Modes, Transmissionless Scattering Modes, and Exceptional Points. Experimentally, we find that all singularities share a universal statistical property: any quantity that diverges as a simple pole at a singularity has a probability distribution function with a -3 power law tail. The tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space of an absorptive scattering system. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that the statistical results presented hold for all generic non-Hermitian scattering systems.</p>

            <p>At low temperature T we expect vacuum tunneling processes to occur in superfluid $^{4}$ He films. We distinguish between extrinsic processes, in which single vortices nucleate by tunneling off boundaries in the system, and intrinsic processes, in which vortex/anti-vortex pairs nucleate far from boundaries. It is crucial to incorporate the varying effective mass of the vortex in tunneling calculations. The intrinsic processes are the superfluid analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in quantum field theory; here they appear as a quantum phase transition at T = 0, driven by an external supercurrent. We calculate the tunneling rate for these processes, and describe a means of testing the predictions using a specific vortex counting experiment.</p>

            <h2>Polarization dependency in Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michelangelo Tagliavini, Fabian Wenzel, Maurits W. Haverkort</p>
            <p>Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) is a well-established tool for probing excitations in a wide range of materials. The measured spectra strongly depend on the scattering geometry, via its influence on the polarization of the incoming and outgoing light. By employing a tensor representation of the 4-point response function that governs the RIXS intensity, we disentangle the experimental geometry from the intrinsic material properties. In dipole-dipole RIXS processes and low-symmetry crystals, up to 81 linearly independent fundamental spectra can be measured as a function of light polarization. However, for crystals or molecules with symmetry, the number of independent fundamental spectra that define the RIXS tensor is significantly reduced. This work presents a systematic framework for determining the number of fundamental spectra and expressing the RIXS tensor in terms of these fundamental components. Given a specific experimental geometry, the measured spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental spectra. To validate our approach, we performed calculations for different point group symmetries, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Within the same framework, we derived expressions for powder spectra in momentum-independent processes and spectra obtained using Bragg spectrometers. This formalism provides a valuable toolkit for optimizing experiment planning, data interpretation, and RIXS simulation.</p>

The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance.

The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.</p>

However, the ability to select between structural enantiomers remains challenging, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we demonstrate a two-step pathway for enantiomer selectivity in layered chiral NbOX$_2$ (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals based on photostriction-driven phase transitions. Ab-initio simulations reveal that optical excitation is capable of inducing a structural phase transition in NbOX$_2$ from the monoclinic ($C2$) ground state to the higher-symmetry ($C2/m$) structure. In the resulting transient high-symmetry state, an applied electric field breaks the residual inversion-symmetry degeneracy, selectively stabilizing one enantiomeric final state configuration over the other. Our results establish a combined optical-electrical control scheme for chiral materials, enabling reversible and non-contact enantiomer selection with potential applications in ultrafast switching, optoelectronics, and chiral information storage.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement spectrum of gapless topological phases: a case study with topological superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archi Banerjee, Meng Zeng</p>
            <p>Using bulk gapless topological superconductors in both 1d and 2d as free fermion model examples, we demonstrate the power of subsystem correlation spectrum (the spectrum of correlation matrix), or equivalently the entanglement spectrum for the case of free fermions, in characterizing the topology of the non-trivial ground state. For the systems considered, we show that signatures of the lowenergy spectrum, including both the edge modes and the bulk modes, appear in the correlation spectrum, albeit with different behaviors. This work generalizes the 2d Li-Haldane entanglement spectrum characterization of topological edge states to 2d topological systems with gapless bulk.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Colby Schimelfenig, Federico Serrano, Corey Halverson, Annesh Mukhopadhyay, Qingze Guan, Peter Engels</p>
            <p>Self-trapping is a hallmark phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. It has significant applications in modern physics, including band structure engineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from interatomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics. In this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit coupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that facilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled system. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between these eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed state and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the time-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the transition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a dynamical phase transition in the system.</p>

            <h2>Static and dynamical properties of quadrupolar quantum droplets in quasi-2D condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-qi Xia, Xiao-ting Zheng, Xiao-wei Chen, Gui-hua Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum droplets, stabilized by beyond-mean-field effects, represent a novel state of matter in quantum many-body systems. While previous studies have focused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar condensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the formation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets in a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a quasi-two-dimensional geometry. Analytical results obtained via the Thomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear scaling between effective area and particle number. These predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations, which also reveal the saturation of peak density and chemical potential at large norm. Furthermore, vortex quantum droplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional nature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the particle number and quadrupolar interaction strength. Collision dynamics demonstrate rich behavior modulated by velocity and topology: ground-state droplets transition from inelastic merging to quasi-elastic scattering and quantum penetration, while vortex droplets exhibit phase-induced repulsion, fragmentation, and topologically protected tunneling. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order interactions and quantum fluctuations govern the formation and stability of quadrupolar droplets. This work lays a theoretical foundation for experimental realization and opens new directions for exploring anisotropic quantum fluids, topological excitations, and applications in quantum sensing and simulation.</p>

            <h2>Flat bands in condensed-matter systems -- perspective for magnetism and superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hideo Aoki</p>
            <p>There is a recent upsurge of interests in flat bands in condensed-matter systems and the consequences for magnetism and superconductivity. This article highlights the physics, where peculiar quantum-mechanical mechanisms for the physical properties such as flatband ferromagnetism and flatband superconductivity that arise when the band is not trivially flat but has a strange Hilbert space with non-orthogonalisable Wannier states, which goes far beyond just the diverging density of states. Peculiar wavefunctions come from a quantum-mechanical interference and entanglement. Interesting phenomena become even remarkable when many-body interactions are introduced, culminating in flatband superconductivity as well as flatband ferromagnetism. Flatband physics harbours a very wide range physics indeed, extending to non-equilibrium physics in laser illumination, where Floquet states for topologcial superconductivity is promoted in flatbands. While these are theoretically curious, possible candidates for the flatband materials are beginning to emerge, which is also described. These provide a wide and promising outlook.</p>

            <h2>First-Principles Exploration of Pentagonal TiN$_8$ and MoN$_8$ Monolayers as New Magnetic Topological Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Wang, Beichen Ruan, Zhuoheng Li, Shu-Shen Lyu, Kaixuan Chen</p>
            <p>The quest for robust, intrinsically magnetic topological materials exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a central challenge in condensed matter physics and the application of revolutionary electronics. However, progress has been hampered by the limited number of candidate materials, which often suffer from poor stability and complex synthesis. Here, we introduce a new paradigm by exploring the emergent magnetism and nontrivial band topology in the largely overlooked family of two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal MN$_8$ monolayers. Employing first-principles calculations, we reveal that these systems host out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground states, a key feature that unlocks nontrivial topological properties driven by the localized $d$-orbitals of the embedded transition metals. Remarkably, we identify TiN$_8$ as a QAH insulator characterized by a Chern number of $C=-1$. Even more strikingly, MoN$_8$ is predicted to be a rare high-Chern-number QAH insulator, boasting a Chern number of $C=2$. Our findings establish the penta-MN$_8$ family as a fertile and versatile platform for realizing exotic topological quantum states. This work not only significantly expands the material landscape for magnetic topological insulators but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for designing next-generation spintronic and quantum computing devices.</p>

            <h2>The nature of polar distortions in ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Jian Zhao, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>Polar distortion, the collective off-center displacements of atoms, is a fingerprint of a ferroelectric that governs its properties and functionalities. Since the 1970s, the concepts of proper, improper and triggered ferroelectrics have been established to shed light on a diversity of polar distortion mechanisms. Such concepts assign a single nature to polar distortion and are helpful to interpret how polar distortions occur in conventional ferroelectrics such as barium titanate. However, applying these concepts to complex ferroelectrics (e.g., polar orthorhombic hafnia) is notoriously challenging and can yield highly controversial arguments. Here we resolve this issue by developing a tailor-made graph theory for clarifying the nature of polar distortions in complex ferroelectrics, which emphasizes that polar distortions in such ferroelectrics usually exhibit multiple natures among proper, improper and triggered characteristics. We demonstrate the robustness of our theory by working with perovsktie superlattices and polar orthorhombic hafnia (i.e., two representative cases). We successfully identify the mixed proper-improper nature in perovsktite superlattices and reconcile the controversy on polar orthorhombic hafnia by confirming its mixed trigger-improper nature. Our work will definitely lead to a revisitation of concepts in ferroelectric physics and provide opportunities for discovering novel ferroelectrics and related phenomena.</p>

            <p>The search for thin film electro-optic (EO) materials that can retain superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear EO coefficients in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to ~200 pm V$^{-1}$ in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining superior EO properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low-temperature EO response is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different ferroelectric phases, leading to a low-symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive EO response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain-tuned BaTiO$_{3}$ thin film that exhibits a linear EO coefficient of 2516 +/- 100 pm V$^{-1}$ at 5 K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported performance thus far. Importantly, the EO coefficient increases by 100x during cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the lowest temperature, significant higher order EO responses also emerge. These results represent a new framework for designing materials with property enhancements by stabilizing highly tunable metastable phases with strain. Copyright 2025 The Author(s).

            <p>Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices.</p>

            <h2>Magnetically controllable nonlinear valley Hall effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijing Fang, Jie Zhang, Zhichao Zhou, Xiao Li</p>
            <p>Valley Hall effect is fundamental to valleytronics and provides a promising avenue for advancing information technology. While conventional valley Hall effect requires the inversion symmetry breaking, the recently proposed nonlinear valley Hall (NVH) effect removes the symmetry constraint, and broaden material choices. However, existing studies are limited to nonmagnetic materials without spin involvement and rely on external strain to break rotational symmetry. Here, to address these limitations, we design a magnetically controllable NVH effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, by the tight-binding model and first-principles calculations. The model calculations demonstrate nonvanishing NVH conductivities can emerge in pristine hexagonal lattice without external strain, with the magnitude, sign, and spin polarization of the conductivities being all dependent on the magnetization orientation. The effect thus generates various spin-polarized valley Hall currents, characterized by distinct combinations of current direction and spin polarization. First-principle results on a ferromagnetic VSi$_2$N$_4$ bilayer confirm considerable NVH conductivities and their dependence on the magnetization. The magnetically controllable NVH effect unlocks the potential of centrosymmetric magnets for valleytronics, and offer opportunities for novel spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Buckling and flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jannes van Poppelen, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with its flat bands provides a rich platform for exploring emergent electronic orders. Similarly, periodically buckled monolayer graphene has been proposed as a tunable alternative for realizing flat bands. Here, we investigate the combined effect of buckling and twisting in bilayer graphene. We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG initially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for sufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This occurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the in-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point resulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that buckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening. While the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice polarization, the latter prefers to preserve it. This prevents buckling from generating even flatter bands at the magic angle. Nevertheless, we find that buckled TBG can exhibit flatter bands than pristine TBG over a wide range of twist angles, with a flatness similar to that of pristine magic-angle TBG.</p>

            <p>First-order phase transitions, characterized by a discontinuous change in the order parameter, are intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, the underlying, material-specific, microscopic mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we unveil a high-temperature incommensurate charge-order precursor with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}^* = (0, \frac{1}{4}+\delta, \frac{1}{2})$ in the 1T' phase of TaTe$_2$, which competes with fluctuating high-temperature Ta trimer bonding states at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO} =(0, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$. The precursor state follows the temperature dependence of the hidden incommensurability of the $\textit{quasi}$-1D nested Fermi surface. In contrast, the low-temperature commensurate charge order at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO}$, characterized by a charge disproportionation of the inequivalent Ta sites, appears to be driven by local chemical bonding. Dynamical lattice calculations identify an imaginary optical mode at $\mathbf{q}^*$, involving an in-plane vibration of the Ta atoms forming a chain-like structure that renormalizes below $T_\mathrm{CO}$. Our experimental and theoretical observations suggest that the controversial first-order phase transition, as captured by phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, results from the competition between two order parameters: one involving Fermi surface nesting and the other involving local chemical bonding.</p>

            <p>The Weyl semimetal CeAlSi crystallises in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal space group $I4_1md$ and exhibits ferromagnetic order below 8 K, thereby breaking both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This unique combination of properties establishes CeAlSi as a model system for studying the interplay between non-trivial topological states and strong electron correlations. In this work, we report observations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the electrical resistivity under magnetic fields up to 68 T applied parallel to the [001] crystallographic axis. Our measurements reveal an abrupt change in the oscillation frequencies near 14 T, which is indicative of a field-induced Lifshitz transition. Additionally, our results are consistent with the ferromagnetic order bringing the Weyl nodes closer to the Fermi level in CeAlSi. Furthermore, they suggest that the RKKY interaction plays an important role.</p>

            <p>Excitement about the magnetic and electronic properties of RuO$_2$ is growing, fueled by reports of antiferromagnetism, strain-induced superconductivity, and its recent classification as a member of a newly proposed magnetic class, altermagnets, with RuO$_2$ widely regarded as the paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ remains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of magnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic scattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on the (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states. Leveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally forbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of colinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering signal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge scattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic band splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly, anisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The combination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$.</p>

            <p>We report on a novel method to grow B20 MnGe thin films which employs an ultrathin CrSi template layer on Si(111). This layer is expected to be non-magnetic, in contrast to MnSi and FeGe buffer layers that have been used previously, allowing an investigation of the intrinsic properties the MnGe in the ultrathin film limit without the influence of a neighboring magnetic layer. Single-phase MnGe(111) films were grown with thicknesses between 2 and 40 nm, which exhibited low interfacial roughnesses on the order of 0.6 nm. The films crystallized in a B20 structure with a small rhombohedral distortion. Magnetometry measurements in out-of-plane fields are consistent with a conical state. However, an unexpected remanent moment develops below 35 K, concomitant with features in the field dependence of the transport data. This provides indirect evidence for the presence of a low-temperature phase which has been identified by others as either a triple-Q topological spin-hedgehog lattice, or a multi-domain single-Q conical state.</p>

            <p>Considering the similarity of the real-space configurations for the opposite spin sublattices in both antiferromagnets (AFM) and altermagnets (AM), the relationship between them should be profound. In this work, we demonstrate that AFM and AM can be connected with spin groups and their subgroups. Consequently, the breaking of the combined inversion or translation operation with time-reversal symmetry (PT or tT) in AFM will induce transition from AFM to AM. We systematically list all collinear spin point groups and space groups that can realize the transition for the three types of AFMs: PT-type, tT-type and PT-tT-type. Moreover, we propose that Floquet engineering using circularly polarized light and surface cutting engineering are effective approaches to break PT and tT symmetries of AFM, respectively, achieving the transition. Interestingly, the features and magnitude of altermagnetic spin splitting can be tuned by adjusting various parameters of Floquet engineering. Our work not only establishes a theoretical framework for the transition from AFM to AM, but also provides practical approaches utilizing the achievements in AFM for a hundred years to obtain AM, significantly expanding the scope of altermagnetic materials for both theoretical studies and future practical applications.</p>

            <p>Few-layer CrPS$_{4}$ is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS$_{4}$ hosts a variety of anomalous Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications.</p>

            <p>The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</p>

            <p>Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.</p>

Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.</p>

            <p>We explore the paired superfluid phases of a Fermi gas in the presence of a continuous Rabi drive. We focus on the case where two components are strongly coupled by the drive, forming hybrid superpositions, and interacting with an uncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we obtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We find that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and BEC-BEC crossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare transition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying interactions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore identify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid transitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized Thouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical temperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also gives possesses additional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled components, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body system. The Rabi-driven Fermi gas thus emerges as a unique platform for engineering and probing a rich array of multi-band superfluid phases.</p>

            <h2>Phonons in Electron Crystals with Berry Curvature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkai Dong, Ophelia Evelyn Sommer, Tomohiro Soejima, Daniel E. Parker, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become `soft' under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked `kineo-elastic' term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Gauge Enhances Self-Healing for Non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yazhuang Miao, Yiming Zhao, Yong Wang, Jie Qiao, Xiaolong Zhao, Xuexi Yi</p>
            <p>We investigate a non-Hermitian extension of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model that incorporates spin-dependent SU(2) gauge fields, represented by non-Abelian couplings between lattice sites, as well as independent nonreciprocal hopping amplitudes. This framework gives rise to a rich phase structure characterized by complex-energy braiding and tunable non-Hermitian skin effects. By employing the generalized Brillouin zone approach, we analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence and identify topological transitions protected by chiral symmetry. Notably, we demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields significantly enhance the dynamical resilience of the system, enabling robust self-healing under a moving scattering potential. These results clarify the role of SU(2) gauge fields in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological phases and indicate that the proposed model can be realized with currently available photonic, atomic, and superconducting experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Two-field theory for phase coexistence of active Brownian particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Perez-Bast√≠as, Rodrigo Soto</p>
            <p>Active Brownian particles (ABPs) serve as a minimal model of active matter systems. When ABPs are sufficiently persistent, they undergo a liquid-gas phase separation and, in the presence of obstacles, accumulate around them, forming a wetting layer. Here, we perform simulations of ABPs in a quasi-one-dimensional domain in the presence of a wall, studying the dynamics of the polarization field. On the course of time, we observe a transition from a homogeneous (where all particles are aligned) to a heterogeneous (where particles align only at the interface) polarization regime. We propose coarse-grained equations for the density and polarization fields based on microscopic and phenomenological arguments that correctly account for the observed phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling conductance in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnets breaking time-reversal symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka</p>
            <p>A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the missing of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\ Phys.\ Soc.\ Jpn.\ \textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <h2>Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In: A First-Principles Insight into Indium-Based Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arafat Rahman, Alamgir Kabir, Tareq Mahmud</p>
            <p>The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and nontrivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature \( T_c \approx 14\ \mathrm{K} \) at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, \( T_c \) increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurens Lootens, Clement Delcamp, Frank Verstraete</p>
            <p>The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>This review explores the development of spin-wave technology, highlighting magnonics as a promising route for radio frequency (RF) communication systems. The rollout of 5G and the upcoming 6G networks intensifies the demand for devices that can operate at higher frequencies while remaining scalable, compact, and energy-efficient - requirements that spin waves are well suited to meet. The first two sections revisit the fundamentals of magnonics, trace major milestones in spin-wave research, and summarize recent advances in materials and device design. The third section reviews RF applications studied over the past 50 years, with emphasis on key passive components, such as filters, limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, and directional couplers. The final section discusses both the advantages and the open challenges of spin-wave devices, including insertion losses, linearity, and power handling, together with the strategies to address them. By linking fundamental insights with technological needs, this review outlines a path toward practical RF platforms. Spin-wave-based devices, with their scalability, versatility, and potential for low-power operation, hold strong promise for future wireless communication, particularly in the 5G and 6G era.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Variable Batch Bayesian Optimization in Materials Research: Synthetic Data Analysis of Noise Sensitivity and Problem Landscape Effects</h2>

            <p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize.</p>

            <p>Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that incorporates the Schr√∂dinger equation as a soft constraint via a loss function penalty into the ML procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</p>

            <h2>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atma Anand</p>
            <p>Information-processing systems that coordinate multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have a much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</p>

These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies. However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films with near-surface NV centers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben T. McDonough, Marius Lemm, Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p>Strong disorder often has drastic consequences for quantum dynamics. This is best illustrated by the phenomenon of Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, where destructive quantum wave interference leads to the complete absence of particle and information transport over macroscopic distances. In this work, we investigate the extent to which strong disorder leads to provably slow dynamics in many-body quantum lattice models. We show that in any spatial dimension, strong disorder leads to a non-perturbatively small velocity for ballistic information transport under unitary quantum dynamics, almost surely in the thermodynamic limit, in every many-body state. In these models, we also prove the existence of a "prethermal many-body localized regime", where entanglement spreads logarithmically slowly, up to non-perturbatively long time scales. More generally, these conclusions hold for all models corresponding to quantum perturbations to a classical Hamiltonian obeying a simple non-resonant condition. Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems in strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in non-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical or quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system.</p>

            <p>The scaling exponent $g$ of the quasiparticle propagator for incompressible fractional quantum Hall states in the Laughlin sequence is expected to be robust against perturbations that do not close the gap. Here we probe the topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the $\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\geq 0.7$ the tunneling conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at $\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge mode.</p>

            <p>Systematically controlling the superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains a significant challenge. Here, we address this by synthesizing high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$) with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice, particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$ rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm 2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the $c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/√Ö, demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity ($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \propto \log T$. Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian $T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichen Xu, Yiqing Zhou, James P. Sethna, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
            <p>The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</p>

            <h2>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Human-in-the-Loop for Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics Fabrication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benius Dunn, Javier Meza-Arroyo, Armi Tiihonen, Mark Lee, Julia W. P. Hsu</p>
            <p>Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.</p>

            <h2>Advanced creep modelling for polymers: A variable-order fractional calculus approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jos√© Geraldo Telles Ribeiro, Americo Cunha Jr</p>
            <p>Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.</p>

            <h2>Bound on entanglement in neural quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisarga Paul</p>
            <p>Variational wavefunctions offer a practical route around the exponential complexity of many-body Hilbert spaces, but their expressive power is often sharply constrained. Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \leq c k\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive power.</p>

            <h2>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Cal√† Lesina</p>
            <p>Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</p>

To assess the formalism, we calculated the linear absorption spectrum of an atomic system under isotropic thermal environment, with systematic variation of system-bath coupling strength and temperature.</p>

            <p>Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development.</p>

            <p>We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</p>

            <p>To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.</p>

            <p>Understanding surface-driven transport is of paramount importance from the perspective of biological applications and the synthesis of microfluidic devices. In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful circumstances. We observe a ratcheting velocity of $\sim 0.15 \;\mu$m/sec for a micrometre-sized particle at room temperature in water when the undulations wavelength is of the order of 1 $\mu$m.</p>

            <p>We derive semiclassical analytical solutions for both the diagonal and off-diagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in a quarter-stadium quantum billiard. For a representative observable, we obtain an explicit expression and an asymptotic closed-form solution that naturally separate into a local contribution and a phase-space correlation term. These analytical results predict the band structure of the observable matrix, including its bandwidth and scaling behavior. We further demonstrate that our analytical formula is equivalent to the prediction of Berry's conjecture. Supported by numerical evidence, we show that Berry's conjecture captures the energetic long-wavelength behavior in the space of eigenstates, while our analytical solution describes the asymptotic behavior of the f function in the semiclassical limit. Finally, by revealing the connection between the bandwidth scaling and the underlying classical dynamics, our results suggest that the ETH carries important physical implications in single-particle and few-body systems, where "thermalization" manifests as the loss of information about initial conditions.</p>

Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.</p>

We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\kappa\sim L^{x_\kappa}$ with $x_\kappa=1.6\pm 0.1$. The divergence is weaker in three dimensions, $x_\kappa=1.25 \pm 0.3$, and the scaling exponent for the shear viscosity, $x_\eta$, is significantly smaller than $x_\kappa$ in both two and three dimensions.</p>

            <p>Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers. We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number. Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\mathcal R_0$. This research provides a robust generalization of $\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Filice, Marco Schir√≤, Giacomo Mazza</p>
            <p>We introduce time-dependent variational principles to study the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum many-body systems, including dynamics described by the full Lindblad master equation, the non-Hermitian dynamics corresponding to the no-click limit of the fully post-selected quantum trajectories, and the dynamics described by a hybrid Lindbladian with a control parameter $\alpha$ which interpolates between the full post-selection and averaging over all quantum trajectories. As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a lossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of two-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts as a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp modification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states. By considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the non-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a universal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady plateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair losses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the dissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in the lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the non-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative temperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached in the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize these findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins which, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle losses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Badhani, Dhanuja G S, Siddhartha Das</p>
            <p>We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</p>

            <p>Universal aspects of thermalization in interacting many-body systems are typically challenging to derive microscopically, yet provide a powerful framework for understanding emergent phenomena. Here, we numerically study the mean-field dynamics of a $(2+1)$D spin system with thousands of spins and show that experimentally-feasible two-body Ising interactions can stabilize a prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge structure with dynamical matter, manifested by a gauge-invariant plateau with exponentially long lifetime. Eventually, the metastable prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure breaks down via a proliferation of Gauss' law defects, similar to bubble formation in false vacuum decay. In this regime, we discover spatio-temporal correlations described by a non-linear surface growth consistent with the $(1+1)$D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We benchmark our results in small systems against semi-classical discrete time Wigner approximation (DTWA) and exact diagonalization (ED), where the breakdown of DTWA signals the emergence of an extensive number of local symmetries that strongly influence the thermalization pathway. Our model provides a testbed for quantum simulators and is directly implementable in large-scale arrays of Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement detection in quantum materials with competing orders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Mazza, Costantino Budroni</p>
            <p>We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials, and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton splittings.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Relaxation and Odd-Even Effect in Finite-Temperature Electron Gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Nilsson, Ulf Gran, Johannes Hofmann</p>
            <p>Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed ``odd-parity'' modes) that involve a collective deformation of the Fermi distribution. Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the entire temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.15T_F$, (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling, and (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, in addition to temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.</p>

            <h2>Lattice Instabilities Along the Transformation from Hexagonal to Cuboidal Structures in Hard- and Soft-Sphere Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andres Robles-Navarro, Shaun Cooper, Andreas W. Hauser, Fabian Zehetmair, Odile Smits, Peter Schwerdtfeger</p>
            <p>The diffusionless Burgers-Bain phase transition from a hcp arrangement to a cuboidal lattice (fcc and bcc) is analysed in great detail for Lennard-Jones solids. From the lattice vectors of an underlying bi-lattice smoothly connecting these phases, we are able to express the corresponding lattice sums for inverse power potentials in terms of fast converging Bessel function expansions resulting in an efficient evaluation to computer accuracy for cohesive energies. From the kissing hard-sphere limit we derive exact analytical expressions for the lattice parameters varying along the minimum energy path of the phase transition. This simple model suggests that for the Burgers-Bain transformation of a LJ solid requires a minimum of four lattice parameters, $(a,\alpha,\beta,\gamma=c/a)$, describing the change in the base lattice lengths $a$ and $c$, the shear force acting on the hexagonal base plane ($\alpha$), the sliding force of the middle layer of the original hexagonal packing arrangement($\beta$), and the cuboidal transformation ($\gamma=c/a$). This choice results in a two-step process: hcp$\to$fcc$\to$bcc. However, a further extension of the parameter space including an additional slide parameter for the middle layer, one suddenly observes a distinct symmetry-breaking effect along the hcp$\rightarrow$fcc transition path with a bifurcation point appearing joining the original Burgers with the Bain path of the bcc$\rightarrow$fcc cuboidal transition. Furthermore, for soft LJ potentials the bcc phase appears as a local minimum along the Burgers hcp$\rightarrow$fcc path with two transition states to either the hcp or fcc phase. The underlying topology of the Burgers-Bain phase transition also incorporates the rhombohedral distortion of the bcc phase, which is analyzed in detail.</p>

            <h2>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl J Friston, Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel</p>
            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <h2>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M. Long, Dominic V. Else</p>
            <p>Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivia Vincent, Aparna Sreekumari, Manoj Gopalakrishnan, Vishwas V Vasisht, Bibhu Ranjan Sarangi</p>
            <p>We investigate the positional behavior of a single bacterium confined within a vesicle by measuring the probability of locating the bacterium at a certain distance from the vesicle boundary. We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Chen, Guijing Duan, Changle Liu, Yi Cui, Weiqiang Yu, Z. Y. Xie, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Frustrated quantum magnets can host a variety of exotic spin excitations, including fractionalized spin excitations coupled to emergent gauge fields at deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) and chiral magnons in altermagnets. Here, we investigate the spin excitation spectra of the highly frustrated $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) Shastry-Sutherland model, focusing on the evolution of low-energy collective modes from the N√©el AFM phase to the plaquette valence bond solid (PVBS). We demonstrate that the AFM state exhibits altermagnetic behavior, characterized by a non-relativistic splitting between two chiral magnon bands. Furthermore, we identify two additional low-energy excitations: a Higgs mode in the longitudinal excitation channel and an $S=0$ excitation with vanishing spectral weight. As the system approaches the AFM-to-PVBS transition, both these modes soften along with the lowest-energy triplet and singlet modes in the PVBS state. The closing gap of the Higgs mode, combined with the nearly degenerate velocities of $S=1$ and $S=0$ excitations, provides spectral evidence that the AFM-to-PVBS transition is proximate to a DQCP with emergent $O(4)$ symmetry. Our results help clarify the spectral signature of a broad class of symmetry enhanced quantum phase transitions including deconfined quantum criticality.</p>

            <h2>The elusive fluid-and-crystal coexistence state in simulations of monodisperse, hard-sphere colloids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Galen Wang, Umesh Dhumal, Monica E. A. Zakhari, Roseanna N. Zia</p>
            <p>We examine why simulations replicating monodisperse purely-repulsive hard sphere (MPRHS) theory fail to produce explicit, spontaneous, equilibrium coexistence of fluid and crystal domains. MPRHS fluid-to-solid phase transitions are well established, as is prediction of the coexistence region via thermodynamic theory. Consensus holds that the MPRHS coexistence region is metastable, where nucleation governs crystallization. Our review explores the abundant physics and rheology literature for MPRHS, revealing two related observations: We find clear mechanistic explanation for crystallization of MPRHS, and that producing spontaneous MPRHS coexistence in simulations is notoriously difficult. Frenkel's mechanism-that vibrational entropy gains offset configurational entropy losses to drive MPRHS phase transition-suggests system size is the fundamental simulation issue. Alder and Wainwright recognized this constraint and emphasized the merit of direct observation in simulations, of explicitly following an isotherm through the coexistence region. But with 1M particles, estimated nucleation time is 317M years. Recent large-scale simulations reinforce this, showing phase transition, but not reporting explicit phase separation. The ideal condition is a tractably-large system and minimal perturbation to exit metastability. Instead, brute force is often used to trigger nucleation and phase separation via seeding, pre-construction, or gravity. Some simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. Putatively-hard WCA potentials allow extra free volume, lowering osmotic pressure and the energy barrier, and avoiding the strict short/long-range entropy challenge. Overall, rheological and computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS remains elusive, awaiting sufficiently large systems of sufficiently hard MPRHS.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Estimation of Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang</p>
            <p>Temperature of a finite-sized system fluctuates due to the thermal fluctuations. However, a systematic mathematical framework for measuring or estimating the temperature is still underdeveloped. Here, we incorporate the estimation theory in statistical inference to estimate the temperature of a finite-sized system and propose optimal estimation based on the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimation. Treating the finite-sized system as a thermometer measuring the temperature of a heat reservoir, we demonstrate that different optimal estimation of parameters yield different formulas of entropy, e.g., optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) aligns with the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). The optimal estimation leads to a achievable energy-temperature uncertainty relation and exhibits sample-size dependence, coinciding with their counterparts in nanothermodynamics. The achievable bound and the non-Gaussian distribution of temperature enable experimental testing in finite-sized systems.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguang Cao, Yuan Miao, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the sensitivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to Fermi surface reconstructions under strain, we investigate how Fermi surface geometry and Van Hove singularities influence the optical Hall response and polar Kerr effect. Within a three-orbital model, we explore the impact of chemical potential and interlayer hopping on superconducting pairing and response functions. We find that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+ig$ symmetries are the leading candidates for the quasi-2D orbital, while a chiral $p$-wave state in the quasi-1D orbitals is essential for generating an accessible Kerr angle. The Lifshitz transition is shown to affect coherence factors and density-of-states peaks, producing sharp signatures in $T_c$ and optical transport. Inter-orbital charge transfer further enhances these effects by modifying the balance between quasi-1D and quasi-2D contributions. These results provide a framework for interpreting Kerr effect experiments in multi-orbital superconductors.</p>

In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated groundstate. We analyze the statistical properties of tunneling conductance maps of increasingly localized states as we approach the edge of the valence band. Using multifractal analysis, we show that the system follows an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NLsMs). We anticipate that this symmetry may be broken in specific - e.g. chiral electronic phases. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis can equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments, thus providing a powerful tool to probe the underlying symmetries of disordered electronic phases.</p>

This approach to probing ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</p>

            <p>In condensed matter physics, experimental control of the properties of materials realizes the aspiration to physically govern the properties of materials and demonstrates an understanding of their underlying physics. In recent years, meaningful progress has been made towards a description of the physics of correlated electron systems, but examples of control of these systems remain rare. In this work, we confirm a phase diagram theoretically proposed for organic Mott insulators. We use $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) materials as experimental realization of the proposed model and demonstrate the ability to tune them both ways across a phase border between a Mott insulator with a uniformly distributed charge and a charge ordered state through the application of uniaxial strain. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through the application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis.

Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions.

            <p>The AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures typically exhibit a positive photoconductivity (PPC) during the light illumination. Surprisingly, we found that introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier into N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures induces a transition in these heterostructures from PPC to negativie photoconductivity (NPC) as the SL period number increased at room temperature. This transition occurred under an infrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the excitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and subsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity yield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. In addition, NPC signal remains relatively stable at high temperatures up to 400 K. The obtained results can be interesting for the development of NPC related devices such as photoelectric logic gates, photoelectronic memory and infrared photodetectors.</p>

            <p>We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals, a class of systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation $\omega^2 \sim k_\parallel^2 + k_\perp^{2n}$, with $n$ a possitive integer. A characteristic feature of multi-Weyl systems is the lack of Lorentz invariance, instead, they possess the reduced spacetime symmetry $(SO(1,1)\times SO(2))\ltimes \mathbb R^4$. In this work we propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry \cite{Andringa:2012uz}. Our proposal allows for a systematic study of the hydrostatic properties via the derivation of the partition function of the system. In addition to multi-Weyl models, our formulation can be applied to systems with similar spacetime symmetry groups, such as Bjorken flow.</p>

Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.</p>

            <p>Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Fr√∂hlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Terry A. Loring, Alexander Cerjan</p>
            <p>The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.</p>

Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.</p>

            <p>Quantum manipulation of molecular radical spins provides a crucial platform for exploring emergent phenomena in many-body systems. Here, we combine surface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy(STM)tip-induced dehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional porphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). High-resolution STS measurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that {\pi}-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by conduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via quantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in the effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains yet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum effects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, the number of parallel porphyrin chains non-monotonically tunes the competition between the Kondo effect and spin exchange, showing opposing trends in strength and demonstrating that both wave-function overlap and the SOMO-LUMO gap collectively govern these interactions. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of many-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for quantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures.</p>

            <h2>Beyond-quasiparticle transport with vertex correction: self-consistent ladder formalism for electron-phonon interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Ponc√©</p>
            <p>We present a self-consistent many-body framework for computing phonon-limited electronic transport from first principles, incorporating both beyond-quasiparticle effects and vertex corrections. Using the recently developed first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with nonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent renormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot G0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials, eliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon emission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder formalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to electron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two state-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the bubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a charge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the optical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method against numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians in the dilute polaronic limit and apply it to real materials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc conductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as well as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric properties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body approaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying many-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions.</p>

            <h2>Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoshi Nishimoto</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling Novel Resonant Interband Contribution to Polarizability in three-dimensional systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Pandey, Snehasish Nandy, Pankaj Bhalla</p>
            <p>Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In three-dimensional materials, it typically comprises an intraband contribution, dependent on the chemical potential, and an interband contribution, largely independent of it. In this study, within the random phase approximation framework, we uncover a novel interband contribution that, unlike the conventional case, exhibits an explicit dependence on the chemical potential, which has no counterpart in two dimensions. In the long-wavelength limit, this term introduces a resonance feature with cubic wave-vector dependence when the chemical potential approaches the band edge, in contrast to the quadratic behavior characteristic of standard intraband and interband processes. Focusing on three-dimensional Dirac nodal line semimetals, we show that the polarizability is intraband-dominated at low frequencies, while interband processes prevail at intermediate and high frequencies, with the overall response being tunable via the chemical potential. Material-specific estimates for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS reveal a strong tunability of both contributions. These findings open new directions for probing frequency-dependent dielectric properties and hold promise for applications in tunable plasmonic and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of superconductivity outside an Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel</p>
            <p>Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium evaporation of Lennard-Jones fluids: Enskog-Vlasov theory and Hertz-Knudsen model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaokang Li, Livio Gibelli, Yonghao Zhang</p>
            <p>Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by both the assumptions underlying the Vlasov forcing term and the approximation introduced by the Enskog collision term for short-range molecular interactions. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, transport coefficients, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The results confirm that deviations from the Maxwellian distribution persist in the vapour region, indicating limitations of the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation under pronounced non-equilibrium conditions. This work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling.</p>

            <p>The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films.</p>

            <p>2H-TaS$_2$ few layers have been grown epitaxially onto GaN(0001). A high substrate growth temperature of 825$^{\circ}$C induces best structural properties of the overlayer, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a monolayer. However, evidence of pits at the interface is provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition at the high growth temperature. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface. Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the grown TaS$_2$ overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility of integration of 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with an important 3D semiconducting material like GaN.</p>

            <p>It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).</p>

It is shown that $S_x < 0$ and $S_y >0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.</p>

            <h2>General approach for partitioning and phase separation in macromolecular coexisting phases</h2>

            <p>Partitioning of (bio)materials in polymeric mixtures is a key phenomenon both in cellular environments, as well as in industrial applications. In cells, several macromolecules are suspended within different biomolecular phases. On the other hand, the coexistence of polymeric aqueous phases has been exploited for the extraction and purification of (bio)materials suspended in water. Despite its relevance, key physical and chemical properties controlling the phase behavior of these complex systems are still lacking. Here, we have developed a classical density functional theory approach for describing the phase coexistence and partitioning of an arbitrary number of polymers and suspended materials. As a case example, we focus on a binary mixture of phase separating polymers in which a third material is dispersed. We explore the effect of size ratios and affinities between the different materials and address their distribution and coexisting densities, and find optimal conditions for partitioning.</p>

            <p>Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.</p>

            <p>Novel antiferromagnets with broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) have launched a new direction in spintronics research, combining the advantageous dynamical properties of conventional antiferromagnets with the controllability typically associated with ferromagnets. However, antiferromagnetic domains are notoriously challenging to image in real-space. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) offers a route to overcome this difficulty: XMCD contrast may be finite in TRS-breaking antiferromagnets with an appropriate magnetic space group. Here, we exploit this to image the octupole domains in a focused ion beam-fabricated device of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, we spatially resolve the weak pre-edge XMCD contrast (of 0.2%) that is sensitive to $T_z$, achieving a contrast resolution better than 0.02%. We observe hysteretic switching of the octupole order through both the XMCD contrast and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect within the same device. These results confirm the bulk nature of this contrast, and establish XMCD-based microscopy as a powerful real space imaging method for TRS-breaking antiferromagnets, including altermagnets, enabling future studies of their dynamics, switching, and symmetry-tunable phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Chatterjee, Daniel Soh, Matt Eichenfield</p>
            <p>We provide a quantum mechanical description of phonon amplification in a heterostructure consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) stacked on top of a piezoelectric material. An applied drift voltage effectively creates a population inversion in the momentum states of the 2DEG electrons, giving rise to spontaneous emission of phonons. Once an acoustic wave is launched, the pumped electrons release phonons via stimulated emission, returning to depleted ground states before being pumped back to the excited states. We show that whereas efficient amplification using a 1D electron gas requires the acoustic wavelength to roughly equal the average electron-electron spacing, a 2DEG enables efficient amplification for any wavelength greater than the average electron-electron spacing. We derive the imaginary and real parts of the 2DEG first-order acoustic susceptibility as functions of electronic drift velocity in specific limits and derive the gain per unit length for the signal and the quantum noise, with the gain matching the classical result in the short-electronic-lifetime (low-mobility) regime. Moreover, we analyze the gain clamping due to pump depletion and calculate the maximum achievable intensity. Our results provide a framework for designing novel acoustic devices including a quantum phononic laser and phase-insensitive quantum phononic amplifiers.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyafur Rahman Pathan, Daryoosh Vashaee</p>
            <p>The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Preparing thermal and ground states is an essential quantum algorithmic task for quantum simulation. In this work, we construct the first efficiently implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\sim\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free "parent Hamiltonians", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our construction serves as a quantum algorithmic counterpart to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.</p>

The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa.

We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs.

            <p>Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the effect of noise, when the system of interest has a local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of qutrits useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate microwave pulse gates to a low error rate to operate transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki), which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as topologically protected ground states, string order, and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. To establish the advantage of qutrits over qubits in the presence of noise, we present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase using tensor network simulations. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</p>

We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms.

We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</p>

            <h2>Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Tsunaki, Anmol Singh, Sergei Trofimov, Boris Naydenov</p>
            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a crucial platform for quantum technologies, where its precise numerical modeling is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. We present here a Python library for simulating the NV spin dynamics under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. Our library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time evolution, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum observable given by fluorescence. The simulation framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, where the states initialization and readout are postulated from the interaction with optical fields. By eliminating oversimplifications such as the adoption of rotating frames for the microwave and radio frequency fields, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics emerging from realistic pulse constraints. The software is illustrated with three examples and validated by comparing the simulations with experimental reports, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (conditional logic gates), sensing (dynamical decoupling sequences with coupled spins) and networks (state teleportation). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, which can be used for a wide range of applications.</p>

            <h2>Target-density formation in swarms with stochastic sensing and dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Hindes, George Stantchev, Klimka Szwaykowska Kasraie, Ira B. Schwartz</p>
            <p>An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.</p>

            <h2>A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nuno Crokidakis, Lucas Sigaud</p>
            <p>In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.</p>

            <p>Systems of individual electrons electrostatically trapped on condensed noble gas surfaces have recently attracted considerable interest as potential platforms for quantum computing. The electrons form the qubits of the system, and the purity of the noble gas surface protects the relevant quantum properties of each electron. Previous work has indicated that manipulation of a confining double-well potential for electrons on superfluid helium can generate entanglement suitable for two-qubit gate operations. In this work, we incorporate a time-dependent tuning of the potential shape to further explore operation of two-qubit gates with the superfluid helium system. Through numerical time evolution, we show that fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be achieved. In particular, we simulate operation of the $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and CZ gates and obtain fidelities of 0.999 and 0.996 with execution times of 2.9 ns and 9.4 ns, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the stability of these gate fidelities under non-ideal execution conditions, which reveals new properties to consider in the device design. With the insights gained from this work, we believe that an experimental realization of two-qubit gates using electrons on helium is feasible.</p>

            <p>Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we develop a coherence theory for ensembles that exploits the probability-phase structure of the quantum state space. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. First, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$, which measures statistical correlations between measurement-accessible probabilities and measurement-inaccessible phases across an ensemble. Then, we prove this satisfies the axioms of a coherence monotone, establishing it as a bona-fide measure of ensemble-level coherence. Eventually, through the definition of the \emph{coherence surplus} $\delta_{\mathcal{C}} \geq 0$, we show how ensemble coherence relates to, but exceeds, density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying structure lost in statistical averaging.</p>

            <h2>Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoya Hayata, Kazuhiro Seki, Seiji Yunoki</p>
            <p>Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Properties of Avalanche Activity in the Two-Dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anubhav Ganguly</p>
            <p>We study the scaling properties of avalanche activity in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model. Instead of the conventional avalanche size distribution, we analyze the site activity distribution, which measures how often a site participates in avalanches when grains are added across the lattice. Using numerical simulations for system sizes up to \(L = 160\), averaged over \(10^4\) configurations, we determine the probability distribution \(P(A, L)\) of site activities. The results show that \(P(A, L)\) follows a finite-size scaling form \[ P(A, L) \sim L^{-2} F\Big(\frac{A}{L^2}\Big). \] For small values \(A \ll L^2\) the scaling function behaves as \[ F(u) \sim u^{-1/2}, \quad \text{corresponding to} \quad P(A) \sim \frac{1}{L}, \] while for large activities \(A \sim O(L^2)\) the distribution decays as \[ F(u) \sim \exp\big(-c_3 u - c_4 u^2\big). \] The crossover between these two regimes occurs at \[ A^* \sim 0.1 \, L^2, \] marking the threshold between typical and highly excitable sites. This characterization of local avalanche activity provides complementary information to the usual avalanche size statistics, highlighting how local regions serve as frequent conduits for critical dynamics. These results may help connect sandpile models to real-world self-organized critical systems where only partial local activity can be observed.</p>

            <p>We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).</p>

            <p>Materials with a Kagome lattice are intensely studied because they host novel, exotic states that combine strong correlations and electronic topology. The AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) group, in particular, is of major interest due to its combination of charge density waves, unconventional superconductivity, and indications of time-reversal symmetry breaking and electronic nematicity. Recently, critical current oscillations in an external magnetic field were observed in an unstructured flake of CsV3Sb5 at low current densities. In this work, we unequivocally show that the origin of these oscillations is a network of Josephson junctions intrinsic to the flake that emerges below its critical temperature. Under radio-frequency radiation, we observe perfectly quantized, integer Shapiro steps. The sensitivity of the step height to the contact placement indicates a rich and complex network of junctions. By performing interference studies along multiple field directions, we demonstrate that the observed interference effects are a result of geometrically small junctions and filamentary supercurrent flow. Upon microstructuring the flake, prominent features of the interference pattern are fully preserved, illustrating the localized nature of these flakes and their stability to thermal cycles. These results pave the way for determining the exact nature of superconductivity in the AV3Sb5 family.</p>

            <p>The interfaces of quantum Hall insulators with superconductors have emerged as a promising platform to realise interesting physics that may be relevant for topologically protected quantum computing. However, these interfaces can host other effects which obscure the detection of the desired excitations. Here we present measurements of the thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface. We explain the heat transport by considering the formation of a hotspot at the interface, which results in a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons that can propagate across the superconductor through vortex cores. The observed thermoelectric effect results in a voltage which changes sign on quantum Hall plateaus and responds to the rearrangement of vortices in the wire. These observations highlight the complex interplay of thermal and charge phenomena at the quantum Hall -- superconductor interfaces and should be considered when interpreting transport measurements in similar systems.</p>

            <p>The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS. The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions, is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties in SOC BECs.</p>

            <h2>Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johnathan Kowalski, Liangbo Liang</p>
            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.</p>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems.</p>

Here, we investigate the quantum many-body properties of spin-2 bosons that undergo two-body atomic loss. We show that the system finally reaches a steady state, which is a mixture of the states with maximum total spins. In addition, we find that a non-classical steady state can be obtained by quenching the quadratic Zeeman coefficient.</p>

Terbium bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures, TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohui Yao, Jiahui Ji, Xuanchi Zhou</p>
            <p>The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a new paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities, enabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional phase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device implementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of correlated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational adaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2) serves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT functionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the lattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane tensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply altering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over a wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive the structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence, which is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier delocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present work establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in correlated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic electronic phases and physical phenomena.</p>

By analyzing the frequency, magnetic field, and temperature dependences of the FMR modes, we have quantified the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density that reaches the value of approximately $ 3.5\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 3$ K and reduces to about $1\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 300$ K. The revealed significantly strong magnetic anisotropy suggests a sizable contribution of the orbital magnetic moment to the spin magnetic moment of Mn, supporting the scenario of the essential role of SOC for the nontrivial electronic properties of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity represents a macroscopic quantum state notable for its rich manifestations of electronic coherence and collective behavior. Kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A= K, Cs, Rb) possess cascade intertwined quantum phases including superconductivity, symmetry-breaking charge orders, nematic orders and topological states, making them attractive materials for exploring exotic superconducting states. However, the superconducting properties and the Cooper pairing behaviors have not been fully explored and understood. In this work, by studying both the magnetoresistance and critical current behaviors in KV3Sb5 ring and pristine flakes, we reveal the charge 2e paring in KV3Sb5 although anomalous oscillations with smaller periodicity were observed, and report the intrinsic superconducting phase coherence in KV3Sb5 flakes. The former is demonstrated by the careful verification of the Little-Parks oscillations in differential resistance colormaps, and the latter indicates the existence of superconducting domains in KV3Sb5. Moreover, we observed a special phenomenon: the transfer of supercurrent interference patterns between the superconducting ring and the superconducting flake, which demonstrates the global critical current effect of the superconducting phase coherence. These findings provide new insights into the Cooper pairing behaviors in KV3Sb5 and highlight the importance of global effect of superconducting phase coherence in the understanding of the superconducting behaviors.</p>

At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument.

            <p>The pair-density-wave (PDW) exhibits periodic amplitude and sign modulations of the superconducting order parameter. Such a pairing state has been proposed to be sensitive to nonmagnetic scattering. In this work, we observe the nonmagnetic PDW-breaking effect in a kagome superconductor, using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe 2x2 PDW induced by the coupling between charge order and superconductivity. The global PDW is substantially suppressed upon doping the kagome lattice with dilute isovalent nonmagnetic impurities, whereas the charge order and uniform superconductivity remain robust. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that PDW is distinctly suppressed near dopants. We attribute the PDW suppression to a nonmagnetic PDW breaking effect, arising from phase sign modulation of PDW in the kagome d-orbital hosting Bogoliubov Fermi states.</p>

            <p>alpha-UTe3, a van der Waals (vdW) actinide compound with a monoclinic ZrSe3-type structure, is a narrow-gap semiconductor with 5f moments. 125Te NMR reveals strongly anisotropic, layer-confined spin fluctuations below about 20 K, with the a-axis component enhanced, and a signal wipeout at the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at TN = 5 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction finds q approx. (0.17, 0.5, 0) and a longitudinal sinusoidal modulation of a-axis moments (amplitude about 0.8 muB) with AFM stacking along b. A CEF singlet-singlet induced-moment framework accounts for the easy-axis anisotropy, the small heat-capacity anomaly at TN, the reduced ordered moment, and the exchange-driven selection of q in this localized 5f vdW magnet, establishing a constrained exchange geometry stabilizing this in-plane incommensurate state.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Engineering-Regulated Electron-Phonon Coupling for Highly Efficient Photoluminescence in Se-doped WS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Quan Shen, Mengmeng Zhang, Zhiming Deng, Taishen Wu, Xuying Zhong, Gang Ouyang, Dongsheng Tang, Qi Zheng, Jiansheng Dong, Weichang Zhou</p>
            <p>The limited quantum yield of strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides grown by vapor-phase methods and during transfer-based stacking poses a fundamental challenge for their optoelectronic applications. Here, we introduce the concept of "entropy engineering" as a transformative strategy to selectively enhance light-matter interactions through controlled electron-phonon coupling. We unveil how tailored entropy introduced via precise selenium doping or interfacial van der Waals proximity can significantly amplify radiative recombination from momentum-dark excitons in WS2 monolayers. Notably, we discover that slight selenium doping drastically enhances the photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 under strain. While both undoped and heavily doped WS2 suffer from strong PL quenching owing to the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, lightly Se-doped samples exhibit an order-of-magnitude increase in emission intensity. This counterintuitive boost is traced to doping-induced structural disorder, which intensifies electron-phonon interactions and unlocks efficient phonon-assisted emission from otherwise non-radiative indirect excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate that van der Waals coupling to adjacent Se-doped layers can impart interfacial entropy and further augment PL via proximity effects. Our work highlights entropy engineering via controlled doping as a powerful strategy for activating high-efficiency light emission in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Local-Antisymmetric Flat Band and Coexisting Correlated stripe charge orders in WSe2-Modulated Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Shihao Zhang, Mengmeng Zhang, Lin He, Qi Zheng</p>
            <p>Insulating, atomically flat transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2 are ideal substrates for probing intrinsic graphene properties. Conventionally, their influence on graphene's band structure is assumed negligible, particularly when small moire patterns form. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the atomic registry in graphene/WSe2 heterostructures profoundly modulates the electronic structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). At special graphene/WSe2 twist angles, an incommensurate moire superlattice hosts three distinct atomic stacking configurations (A, B, X types). These induce position-dependent potentials that asymmetrically shift MATBG's flat bands, transforming them from hole-side to electron-side asymmetric within a single AA-stacked region. This symmetry breaking enables the unprecedented coexistence of orthogonal stripe charge orders in the correlated regime-a phenomenon previously considered mutually exclusive due to Coulomb repulsion. This band modulation arises from the synergistic effects of the graphene/WSe2 interfacial atomic registry and heterostrain within the MATBG, exhibiting multi-field tunability. Our work establishes interfacial atomic registry as a critical, previously overlooked tuning parameter for flat-band physics, opening avenues to engineer correlated quantum states in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Spinon band flattening by its emergent gauge field in quantum kagome ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masafumi Udagawa, Roderich Moessner</p>
            <p>Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.</p>

            <p>The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Pb/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Fe (where Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied. Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect. This opens new avenues for the development of such systems and their potential applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Behavior of passive polymeric tracers of different topologies in a dilute bath of active Brownian particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramanand Singh Yadav, Ralf Metzler, Rajarshi Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Using computer simulations in two dimensions we investigate the dynamics and structure of passive polymeric tracer with different topologies immersed in a low-density active particle bath. One of the key observations is that polymer exhibit faster dynamics compared to passive colloidal particles at high activity, for the same particle density, in both linear and star polymer topologies. This enhanced motion is attributed to the accumulation of active particles, which induces prolonged and persistent movement of the polymer. Further analysis reveals that star polymers exhibit more complex and intriguing behavior than their linear counterparts. Notably, the accumulation of active particles promotes the pairing of arms in star polymers. For instance, a three-armed star polymer adopts a conformation similar to a linear polymer with two-arms due to this pairing as a result, at high activity, the dynamics of both the polymers converge. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a linear polymer with the same total number of beads as the star polymer. Interestingly, at high activity -- where arm pairing in the star polymer is significant -- the star polymer demonstrates faster dynamics than the linear polymer, despite having the identical number of beads. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interactions between active and passive components of varying topologies in dilute systems and highlight their potential for innovative applications ranging from materials science to biomedicine.</p>

            <h2>One-dimensional topological superconductors with nonsymmorphic symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Tymczyszyn, Edward McCann</p>
            <p>We present example four-band Hermitian tight-binding Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians and Kramer's degenerate Hamiltonians in one dimension. Starting from a generalized Rice-Mele model, we incorporate superconducting terms to obtain a four-band BdG Hamiltonian with intrinsic charge-conjugation symmetry, and constrain it using symmorphic or nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetries. In position space we find that each form of time-reversal symmetry, when applied to random BdG matrices, results in a unique block diagonalization of the Hamiltonian when translational symmetry is also enforced. We provide representative models in all relevant symmorphic symmetry classes, including the non-superconducting CII class. For nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry, we identify a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index with two phases supporting Majorana zero modes and two without, and study disorder effects in the presence of topological solitons. We further generalize a winding-number method, previously applied only to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants without Kramer's degeneracy, to compute indices for both the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model and a non-superconducting AII model with nonsymmorphic chiral symmetry and Kramer's degeneracy. We propose topolectric circuit implementations of the charge-density-wave and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ models which agree with the topological calculations. Finally, we show that, in one dimension, nonsymmorphic unitary symmetries do not produce new topological classifications beyond $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnet superconductor hybrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Tero T. Heikkil√§, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We study the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in superconducting altermagnets and superconductor altermagnet hybrids by computing the alternating spin current and edge the spin density in the presence of an alternating electric field. We show that while in the normal state the effect is not sensitive to the field frequency, in the superconducting state, there is a strong effect for frequencies on the scale of $\Delta_0$ or lower. We contrast the effect to the spin accumulation induced by the spin-Hall effect, by showing that for the altermagnet spin-splitter effect the out-of-phase spin density does not diverge in the adiabatic limit. This difference is attributed to the absence of any equilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnets. In fact, the out-of-phase component vanishes below the gap excitation frequency $2\Delta_0$, because below this frequency the absence of dissipation and the behavior of the system under time-reversal directly determine the relative phase between the charge current, spin current, and spin accumulation. The nonequilibrium effect can be tuned by external parameters like temperature. In fact, it has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, taking its largest value for temperatures around $0.8T_{c}$. The value at this temperature can be significantly larger than the normal state spin density or the low temperature spin density. Thus, besides using the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect to identify altermagnets, its tunability makes it also suitable for applications.</p>

            <p>Dodecagonal oxide quasicrystals (OQCs) have so far been limited to a few elemental systems, with no general formation mechanism established. Here, we demonstrate a versatile approach to OQC formation via a host-atom-induced transformation of a metal-oxide honeycomb (HC) network. Adsorption of Ba, Sr, or Eu onto the HC layer triggers its reorganization into a dodecagonal tiling, as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Full conversion occurs when 73% of the honeycomb rings are occupied. Kelvin probe and UV photoelectron spectroscopy show a linear decrease in work function with increasing host coverage, followed by a sharp increase upon quasicrystal formation due to reduced host dipoles. This transformation mechanism enables the fabrication of structurally precise OQCs, including a new Eu-Ti-O phase that extends the field to lanthanide quasicrystals, forming a 2D grid of localized magnetic moments. The method offers a general route to explore lattice-matched substrates for epitaxial growth and may be adapted to other 2D honeycomb materials - such as graphene, hexagonal ice, and silica - paving the way for engineered aperiodic systems beyond transition metal oxides.</p>

            <h2>A minimal and universal representation of fermionic wavefunctions (fermions = bosons + one)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Fu</p>
            <p>Representing fermionic wavefunctions efficiently is a central problem in quantum physics, chemistry and materials science. In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.</p>

            <p>A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Soldner, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto</p>
            <p>Stochastic resetting generates nonequilibrium steady states by interspersing unitary quantum dynamics with resets at random times. When the state to which the system is reset is chosen conditionally on the outcome of a global and spatially resolved measurement, the steady state can feature collective behavior similar to what is typically observed at phase transitions. Here we investigate such conditional reset protocol in a system of noninteracting spins, where the reset state is chosen as a magnetization eigenstate, that is selected (conditioned) on the outcome of a previous magnetization measurement. The stationary states that emerge from this protocol are characterized by the density of spins in a given magnetization eigenstate, which is the analogue of the order parameter. The resulting stationary phase diagram features multiple nonanalytic points. They are of first-order type for half-integer spin, while multicritical behavior, signalled by both first and second-order discontinuities, is found for integer spin. We also show that the associated dynamics is nonergodic, i.e., which stationary state the system ultimately assumes is determined be the initial state. Interestingly, the mechanism underlying these phenomena does not rely on interactions, but the emergent nonlinear behavior is solely a consequence of correlations induced by the measurement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijie Sun, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo</p>
            <p>The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.</p>

Our calculations confirm the dominant role of $c$ axis strain, i.e., along the direction of the V-V dimerization in the M1 phase. Our analysis suggests that this effect stems primarily from the weakening of the lattice stiffness, with the hopping along the $c$ axis playing a minor role. We also confirm that, in strain scenarios that deform the basal plane, the $c$ axis strain still has a dominant effect on the phase stability.</p>

Realizing and distinguishing these excitations in a single material remains a significant challenge. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a high-quality single crystal of copper benzoate, we identify and characterize all three excitation types by tuning the magnetic field at ultra-low temperatures. At a low field of 0.2 T, a temperature-independent spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) over more than a decade confirms the presence of spinons. Below 0.4 K, an additional relaxation channel emerges, characterized by $1/T_1 \propto T$ and a spectral weight growing as $-\ln(T/T_0)$, signaling a random-singlet ground state induced by weak quenched disorder. At fields above 0.5 T, a field-induced spin gap $\Delta \propto H^{2/3}$ observed in both $1/T_1$ and the Knight shift signifies soliton excitations. Our results establish copper benzoate as a unique experimental platform for studying one-dimensional quantum integrability and the interplay of disorder and correlations.</p>

            <p>We extensively study the phenomenology of one dimensional Nonreciprocal Cahn Hilliard model for varying nonreciprocity $(\alpha)$ and different boundary conditions. At small $\alpha$, a perturbed uniform state evolves to a defect laden configuration that lacks global polar order. Defects are the sources and sinks of travelling waves and nonreciprocity selects defects with a unique wave number that increases monotonically with $\alpha_c$. A critical threshold $\alpha_c$ marks the onset of a transition to states with finite global polar order. For periodic boundaries, above $\alpha_c$, the system shows travelling waves that are completely ordered. In contrast, travelling waves are incompatible with Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. Instead, for $\alpha \gtrsim \alpha_c$, we find fluctuating domains that show intermittent polar order and at large $\alpha$, the system partitions into two domains with opposite polar order.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent work that mapped the low-temperature properties of a class of frustrated spin $S=1$ kagome antiferromagnets with competing exchange and single-ion anisotropies to the fully-packed limit (with each vertex touched by exactly one dimer or nontrivial loop) of a system of dimers and nontrivial (length $s > 2$) loops on the honeycomb lattice, we study this fully-packed dimer-loop model on the three-dimensional bipartite cubic and diamond lattices as a function of $w$, the relative fugacity of dimers. We find that the $w \rightarrow 0$ O($1$) loop-model limit is separated from the $w \rightarrow \infty$ dimer limit by a geometric phase transition at a nonzero finite critical fugacity $w_c$: The $w>w_c$ phase has short loops with an exponentially decaying loop-size distribution, while the $w<w_c$ phase is dominated by large loops whose loop-size distribution is governed by universal properties of the critical O($1$) loop soup. This transition separates two {\em distinct} Coulomb liquid phases of the system: Both phases admit a description in terms of a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field $P_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})$ on links of the lattice and are characterized by dipolar correlations at long distances. The transition at $w_c$ is a flux confinement-deconfinement transition. Equivalently, and independent of boundary conditions, half-integer test charges $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined for $w>w_c$, but become deconfined in the small-$w$ phase. Although both phases are unstable to a nonzero fugacity for the charge $\pm 1/2$ excitations, the destruction of the $w >w_c$ Coulomb liquid is characterized by an interesting slow crossover, since test charges with $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined in this phase.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials are highly promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature.

            <h2>Strain-induced multiferroicity in Cr1/3NbS2</h2>

            <p>Multiferroic materials, in which electric polarization and magnetic order coexist and couple, offer rich opportunities for both fundamental discovery and technology. However, multiferroicity remains rare due to conflicting electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. One route to circumvent this challenge is to exploit the noncollinear ordering of spin cycloids, whose symmetry permits the emergence of polar order. In this work, we introduce another pathway to multiferroic order in which strain generates polarization in materials that host nonpolar spin spirals. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we chose the spin spiral in the well-studied helimagnet Cr1/3NbS2. To detect the induced polarization, we introduce the technique of magnetoelectric birefringence (MEB), an optical probe that enables spatially-resolved and unambiguous detection of polar order. By combining MEB imaging with strain engineering, we confirm the onset of a polar vector at the magnetic transition, establishing strained Cr1/3NbS2 as a type-II multiferroic.</p>

            <h2>Finite-temperature phase diagram and collective modes of coherently coupled Bose mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunilkumar V, Rajat, Sandeep Gautam, Arko Roy</p>
            <p>We investigate the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in coherently (Rabi) coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at zero and finite temperatures, exploring different routes to the transition by tuning the Rabi coupling or increasing the temperature at a fixed coupling. Using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory within the Popov approximation, we map out the finite-temperature phase diagram of a three-dimensional homogeneous condensate and identify the critical line through the softening of the spin gap. Magnetization and the spin dispersion branch reveal the progressive suppression of the ferromagnetic order with increasing temperature. In quasi-one-dimensional harmonic traps, the transition, driven by Rabi coupling, is inferred through the softening of the spin breathing mode with its minimum shifting to lower coupling values with increasing temperature. Notably, the thermally driven transition causes monotonic hardening of all the spin modes. For both coupling and temperature-driven transition, the hybridized density modes in the ferromagnetic phase acquire more density character while approaching the critical point.</p>

            <h2>Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite</h2>

            <p>The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruiqi Xu, Arnab Seth, Itamar Kimchi</p>
            <p>We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</p>

            <p>Accurate simulations of the Hubbard model are crucial to understanding strongly correlated phenomena, where small energy differences between competing orders demand high numerical precision. In this work, Neural Quantum States are used to probe the strongly coupled and underdoped regime of the square-lattice Hubbard model. We systematically compare the Hidden Fermion Determinant State and the Jastrow-Backflow ansatz, parametrized by a Vision Transformer, finding that in practice, their accuracy is similar. We also test different symmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest energies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical systems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations display features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including antiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations. Our results demonstrate both the promise and current challenges of neural quantum states for correlated fermions.</p>

We also show that a molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and liquid adhesion.</p>

            <p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.</p>

            <p>Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.</p>

            <p>We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.</p>

The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan London, Mohammad R. Momeni</p>
            <p>Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum dynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum correlation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary time slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring polymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), use the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others, like RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time dynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized bead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide accurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low temperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where we utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of beads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this work, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a number of different implementations of the method through the calculation of correlation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The effectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of the operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce results on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold reduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components.</p>

            <p>Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.</p>

At a low magnetic field of up to ~50 mT, the tracking and reconstruction accuracy is only minimally influenced. Beyond a magnetic field of ~80 mT the tracking capabilities diminish significantly. Operating a two-layered scheme using small magnetic fields hence does not require adaptations. Only at large magnetic fields, a tracking scheme that makes use of an accurate field map or the use of at least three layers must be employed to achieve reliable particle tracking.</p>

            <p>This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven methodology for predicting a combination of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values.</p>

            <p>Life relies on a sophisticated metabolic molecular machinery that turns over high-energy molecules to evolve complex macromolecules and assemblies. At the molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.</p>

            <p>This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.</p>

            <p>Charged water drops are more widespread than commonly acknowledged. For example, raindrops typically carry charges of order Q ~ 1 pC, while routine pipetting in the laboratory produces drops with Q ~ 50 pC. Here, we show that such modest charging can spontaneously generate periodic Coulomb fissions for evaporating water drops on lubricated surfaces, with more than 60 successive cycles observed over 30 min. Interestingly, the underlying instability can be quantitatively predicted by two fissility thresholds: one marking the onset of drop elongation and another triggering fission. Each fission culminates with a fine liquid jet that disintegrates into 40-50 microdroplets, expelled within microseconds. The phenomenon spans an extraordinary range of length scales (from millimetres to microns) and time scales (hour to microseconds), with broad potential applications ranging from nanoscale fabrication to electrospray ionization.</p>

We investigate possible consequences of such two-way coupling in a turbulent suspension of inertial particles in one and two-point Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. In particular, we find signatures of a possibly enhanced intermittency in the vorticity distributions. We characterize the changes in the (small-scale) geometry of the flow via the Okubo-Weiss parameter. Finally, we examine the scaling properties of the second-order (vorticity) structure functions and find a non-trivial form of scale-invariance at finite mass-loading. This suggests that a dual-scale forcing mechanism on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation may be an effective model to mimic the role of particle feedback in turbulence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Maruyama, Masayuki Ohzeki, Kazuyuki Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing (QA) with a transverse field often fails to sample degenerate ground states fairly, limiting applicability to problems requiring diverse optimal solutions. Although Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is widely used to simulate QA, its ability to reproduce such unfair ground-state sampling remains unclear because stochastic and coherent quantum dynamics differ fundamentally. We quantitatively evaluate how accurately QMC reproduces the sampling bias in QA by comparing the final ground-state distributions from the QMC master equation and the Schr√∂dinger equation. We find QMC tends to produce uniform ground-state probabilities, unlike QA's biased distribution, and that this uniformity bias strengthens as annealing proceeds. Our analysis reveals that this bias originates from replica alignment -- the dominance of configurations in which all Trotter replicas coincide -- caused by the energetic suppression and entropic reduction of kink configurations (replica mismatches). These findings clarify a fundamental limitation of discrete-time QMC in faithfully simulating QA dynamics, highlighting the importance of replica correlations and transition rules in achieving realistic ground-state sampling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.</p>

            <p>Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.</p>

Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) √Ö, b = 3.44(1) √Ö, c = 5.94(1) √Ö and \b{eta} = 117(1)¬∞. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubr√©elite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 √Ö, b = 3.440 √Ö, c = 11.441 √Ö and \b{eta} = 90.55¬∞, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubr√©elite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases on spherical Fermi surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Anwasia, Diogo Ars√©nio</p>
            <p>We consider the description of a Fermi gas of free electrons given by the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation, and aim at providing a precise mathematical understanding of the Fermi ground state and its first-order approximation of excited states on the Fermi sphere. In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article. Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions. The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.</p>

            <p>Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) operating at ultralow temperatures serve as promising acoustic platforms for implementing microwave-optical transduction and radio frequency (RF) front-ends in aerospace communications because of the exceptional electromechanical coupling (k^2) and frequency scalability. However, the properties of LWRs at cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood yet. Herein, we experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency in higher order antisymmetric LWRs down to millikelvin temperatures. The high-frequency A1 and A3 mode resonators with spurious-free responses are comprehensively designed, fabricated, and characterized. The quality factors of A1 modes gradually increase upon cryogenic cooling and shows 4 times higher than the room temperature value, while A3 mode resonators exhibit a non-monotonic temperature dependence. Our findings provide new insights into loss mechanisms of cryogenic LWRs, paving the way to strong-coupling quantum acoustodynamics and next-generation satellite wireless communications.</p>

            <p>Mixing the fields generated by different light sources has emerged as a powerful approach for engineering non-Gaussian quantum states. Understanding and controlling the resulting photon statistics is useful for emerging quantum technologies that are underpinned by interference. In this work, we investigate intensity correlation functions arising from the interference of resonance fluorescence from a quantum emitter with a coherent laser field. We show that the observed bunching behavior results from a subtle interplay between quantum interference and the normalization of the correlation functions. We show that by adjusting the mixing ratio and phase one can achieve full tunability of the second-order correlation, ranging from anti-bunching to bunching. We further extend our analysis to third-order correlation functions, both experimentally and theoretically, to provide new insights into the interpretation of higher-order correlations and offer practical tools for shaping quantum optical fields.</p>

            <h2>A Large-Language-Model Assisted Automated Scale Bar Detection and Extraction Framework for Scanning Electron Microscopic Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Chen, Ruotong Yang, Zhengyang Zhang, Mehreen Ahmed, Yanming Wang</p>
            <p>Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.</p>

            <h2>Bright Single-Photon Emission from Individual Tin-Vacancy Centers in Multi-Cone Diamond Waveguides</h2>

            <p>Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescence (PL) is a ubiquitous proxy for material quality in optoelectronic devices, widely used for high-throughput materials discovery. However, we demonstrate that in the presence of charge-selective contacts, PL loses its predictive reliability and can exhibit strong quenching even in highly efficient photovoltaic devices under open-circuit conditions. By combining steady-state and transient PL with contactless transient surface photovoltage measurements we disentangle the intertwined processes of extraction and recombination, clarifying the physical origin of this phenomenon. This joint approach reveals extraction dynamics not captured by PL alone. A digital replica of the interface shows that Coulomb attraction and interfacial recombination are the fundamental mechanisms driving quenching after charge extraction. Based on these insights, we present a decision tree for heterojunction classification and PL interpretation applicable across diverse optoelectronic systems, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs. Our approach supports systematic screening and optimization of half-devices, bridging the gap between accelerated materials discovery and accelerated device discovery.</p>

            <h2>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hubert J. Naguszewski, Christopher D. Woodgate, David Quigley</p>
            <p>Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Synchronization of Perturbed Oscillating Coherences</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi J. Zhao, Joel E. Moore, Juzar Thingna, Christopher W. W√§chtler</p>
            <p>Synchronization in quantum systems has been recently studied through persistent oscillations of local observables, which stem from undamped modes of the dissipative dynamics. However, the existence of such modes requires fine-tuning the system to satisfy specific symmetry constraints. We investigate the response of spin systems that possess such oscillating modes to generic, weak perturbations. We show that even when these perturbations break the symmetry and lead to a single steady state, the phase correlations in the resulting state exhibit signatures of synchronization. Our results therefore connect the persistent oscillation notion (dynamical) and the notion based on phase correlations (steady-state) of synchronization, which so far have been regarded as distinct phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrate that steady-state synchronization in these systems can exhibit features that are absent in the dynamical synchronization. Our work suggests robustness of synchronization and points toward a potential unifying framework of quantum synchronization.</p>

            <p>Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.</p>

            <p>We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, G.S. Japaridze</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.</p>

            <p>Understanding how light modifies long-range order in quantum materials is key to improving our ability to control functionality. However, this is challenging if the response is heterogeneous. Here we address the most common form of light-induced heterogeneity, surface melting, and measure the dynamics of orbital order in the layered manganite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. We isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk by measuring the orbital truncation rod as well as orbital Bragg peak. After photoexcitation, the orbital Bragg peak shows an unusual narrowing, which suggests an increase in the correlation length in the probed volume. In contrast, the correlation length at the surface decreases. These differences can be reconciled if the material is heterogeneous, and light melts a less ordered surface. By isolating the surface response, we determine that the loss of long-range order is an incoherent process, which is likely accompanied by the formation of local polarons.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</p>

            <p>We study in depth the charge susceptibility for the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) and orbital (OHK) models. As either of these models describes a Mott insulator, the charge susceptibility takes on the form of a modified density response function with lower and upper Hubbard bands, thereby giving rise to a multi-pole structure. The particle-hole continuum consists of hot spots along the $\omega$ vs $q$ axis arising from inter-band transitions. Such transitions, which are strongly suppressed in non-interacting systems, obtain here because of the non-rigidity of the Hubbard bands. This modified density response function gives rise to a plasmon dispersion that is inversely dependent on the momentum, resulting in an additional contribution to the conventional f-sum rule. This extra contribution originates from a long-range diamagnetic contribution to the current. This results in a non-commutativity of the long-wavelength ($q\rightarrow 0$) and thermodynamic ($L\rightarrow\infty$) limits. When the correct limits are taken, we find that the Kubo response computed with either open or periodic boundary conditions yields identical results that are consistent with the continuity equation contrary to recent claims. We also show that the long wavelength pathology of the current noted previously also plagues the Anderson impurity model interpretation of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).</p>

            <h2>Multiple Majorana bound states and their resilience against disorder in planar Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta</p>
            <p>Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.</p>

            <p>Quantum spintronics is an emerging field focused on developing novel applications by utilizing the quantum coherence of magnetic systems. A key challenge in this context is achieving scalable long-range quantum information transmission in magnetic systems. Here, we propose a novel transmission scheme based on topological spin textures in a hybrid architecture combining a magnetic racetrack and localized spin qubits. We demonstrate this principle by employing the domain wall (DW), the most fundamental texture, to transport quantum signal between distant qubits. We introduce a measurement-free protocol that utilizes DW mobility to enable high-fidelity and tunable entanglement generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin qubits can function as quantum stations on the racetrack, enabling flexible state transfer among fast-moving DWs on a single track. Finally, we discuss concrete material platforms to implement the proposed scheme. Our work introduces a new hybrid quantum platform that merges topological spin textures with solid-state qubits, offering a scalable architecture for quantum information processing and opening promising directions for quantum spintronics.</p>

            <p>Among all materials, mono-crystalline diamond has one of the highest measured thermal conductivities, with values above 2000 W/m/K at room temperature. This stems from momentum-conserving `normal' phonon-phonon scattering processes dominating over momentum-dissipating `Umklapp' processes, a feature that also suggests diamond as an ideal platform to experimentally investigate phonon heat transport phenomena that violate Fourier's law. Here, we introduce dilute nitrogen-vacancy color centers as in-situ, highly precise spin defect thermometers to image temperature inhomogeneities in single-crystal diamond microstructures heated from ambient conditions. We analyze cantilevers with cross-sections in the range from about 0.2 to 2.6 $\mu$m$^2$, observing a strong reduction of the cantilevers' conductivity as the width decreases. We use first-principles simulations based on the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation and viscous heat equations to quantitatively predict the cantilevers' thermal transport properties, rationalizing how the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic phonon scattering mechanisms determines the observed non-diffusive behavior. Our temperature-imaging method paves the way for the exploration of unconventional, non-diffusive heat transport phenomena in devices and nanostructures of arbitrary geometries.</p>

            <p>The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p>

The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-range colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahsan Javed, Sajid Ali</p>
            <p>Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Two-body contact of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moksh Bhateja, Nicolas Dupuis, Adam Ran√ßon</p>
            <p>The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas that relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition, we show that a ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be defined from the singular part $P-P_{\rm MI}$ of the pressure ($P_{\rm MI}$ is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression $C_{\rm univ}=C_{\rm DBG}(|n-n^{\rm MI}|,a^*)$ coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective ``scattering length'' $a^*$ of the quasi-particles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density $|n-n^{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Close to the transition, we find that the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k} = n_{\bf k} - n^{\rm MI}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution exhibits a high-momentum tail of the form $Z_{\rm QP} C_{\rm univ}/|{\bf k}|^4$ over a broad region of the Brillouin zone, where $Z_{\rm QP}$ is the quasi-particle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. Our results demonstrate that the notion of contact extends to strongly correlated lattice bosons, and we argue that the contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices and magnetic insulators.</p>

            <h2>Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Dupuis, Moksh Bhateja, Adam Ran√ßon</p>
            <p>We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid state near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</p>

            <h2>Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamalesh Bera, Pritam Chatterjee, Priyanka Mohan, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</p>

            <h2>The Capriccio method as a versatile tool for quantifying the fracture properties of glassy materials under complex loading conditions with chemical specificity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Weber, Maxime Vassaux, Lukas Laubert, Sebastian Pfaller</p>
            <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to provide insights into fracture mechanisms while maintaining chemical specificity. However, particle-based techniques such as MD are limited in terms of accessible length scales and applicable boundary conditions, which restricts the investigation of fracture phenomena in typical engineering settings. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we apply the partitioned-domain Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples representing silica glass with the finite element (FE) method. With this approach, we perform mode I (rectangular panel under tension, three-, and four-point bending), mode II as well as mode III (rectangular panel under in-plane or out-of-plane shear) simulations. Thereby, we investigate multiple criteria to identify the onset of crack propagation based on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic energy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement. The approach presented provides quantitatively plausible results for the critical stress intensity factors KIc, KIIc, and KIIIc. This contribution shows that the Capriccio method is a flexible means of performing fracture simulations that take into account boundary conditions typical of experimental test setups with atomistic specificity near the crack tip. While also pointing out the current limitations of the Capriccio method, we demonstrate its potential to integrate atomistic insights into FE models with significantly larger overall dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Realization of strain induced multiple topological phases in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An $ab$-$initio$ study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>The search of multiple topological phases (TPs) and their transitions by tuning different parameters through chemical substitutions, electric field, magnetic field, strain and Floquet engineering, etc has garnered a widespread attention in recent time. In spite of great effort, the observations of multiple TPs in a single material and multiple TP transitions in the presence of one parameter remain elusive. Here we demonstrate the presence of multiple TPs and their transitions with uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) in orthorhombic Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using $state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ $ab$-$initio$ calculations. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits a single (type-II) nodal-ring and in the presence of SOC, it hosts Weyl phase with seven Weyl points (three at $\Gamma$ and four at general positions) along with nodal arcs. On the application of UCS, it remains type-II nodal-ring $<5.5$\%, which further evolves into type-III nodal-ring for $5.5\% \leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%. Interestingly, at 5.6\% of UCS, it shows Weyl phase with four Weyl nodes even in the absence of SOC. All the above-mentioned seven Weyl points persist below $5$\% of UCS. For 5\% $\leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%, four Weyl points (at general positions) disappear and nodal-arcs remain intact in all the studied range of UCS. The TPs observed in the absence of SOC appears to arise due to the presence of strain driven topological flat band, which is typically reported to be seen in kagome and Lieb lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans√§tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Antonio Sulangi</p>
            <p>Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</p>

            <h2>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Le Doussal</p>
            <p>We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</p>

            <h2>Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation and entropy production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Van Tuan Vo, Andreas Dechant, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by overdamped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap of the symmetrized time-evolution operator closes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.</p>

            <p>Numerical renormalization group (NRG) is formulated for nonequilibrium steady-state by converting finite-lattice many-body eigenstates into scattering states. Extension of the full-density-matrix NRG for a biased Anderson impurity model, simplified by formulating with the original orbital basis as the Hamiltonian, enables detailed studies of the sub-Kondo spectral evolution in the zero-temperature limit, confirming the double-resonance structure at bias of the Kondo energy scale $T_K$. The distribution shows distinct multi-scale spectral features at energy $\omega$ below the Kondo scale ($\omega\lesssim T_K$) and near the bias ($\omega\gtrsim V$), leading to the nonequilibrium temperature $T_{\rm loc}$ local to the Kondo dot scaling as $k_BT_{\rm loc}\approx V$ for $V\gg T_K$. The current-voltage relation in the low-temperature limit ($T\ll T_K$) deviates from the unitary limit as the bias exceeds the Kondo scale ($V/2\gtrsim T_K$) and reaches the current saturation regime.</p>

            <p>Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.</p>

            <p>Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate the presence of structural heterogeneity captured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that eludes the routine characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electronic transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtained crystals diverse in stoichiometry and structure, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\lesssim{x}\lesssim1$. Using SCXRD, we found global structural diversity, identifying three new structure types: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{2.0}$/Sn$_{0.08}$TaSe$_{1.96}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.16}$TaSe$_{2.0}$ ($P6_3/mmc$), and Sn$_{1.2}$TaSe$_{1.9}$ ($Fmm2$). Using STEM, we observed local structural diversity, manifested as regions of highly variable stacking within a single crystal. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction did not resolve all observed global structures. Raman spectroscopy was unable to distinguish between different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Electronic transport measurements showed consistent superconductivity and charge density wave behavior irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount. Our results indicate that routine approaches to characterization of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides may be inadequate for capturing the diversity of this family of materials, highlighting the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</p>

In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the \(C_{2}\) symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity (\(\beta\)). At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of \(\beta\) inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir√© Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) that incorporates Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to investigate the interplay between disorder, spin-orbit interaction, and nonlocal spatial correlations in disordered two-dimensional systems. By analyzing the average density of states, momentum-resolved self-energy, and return probability, we demonstrate how Rashba SOC and nonlocal correlations jointly modify single-particle properties and spin-dependent interference. The method captures key features of the symplectic universality class, including SOC-induced delocalization signatures at finite times. We benchmark the DCA results against those obtained from the numerically exact kernel polynomial method, finding good agreement. This validates the computationally efficient, mean-field-based DCA framework as a robust tool for exploring disorder, spin-orbit coupling, and nonlocal correlation effects in low-dimensional systems, and paves the way for simulating multiorbital and strongly correlated systems that were previously inaccessible due to computational limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silpa Mariya, Jeremy J. Barr, P. Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash</p>
            <p>We investigate the static and dynamic properties of dendrimers diffusing through a network of linear associative polymers using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as bead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the accurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the associating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers interact attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct comparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural analysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing network concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers exhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer dynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly influenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing attraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian displacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh size. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for nanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the network locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their stickiness. These findings offer insight into the interplay between macromolecular architecture, binding interactions, and transport in polymeric environments.</p>

The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance.

The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pok Man Tam, Hao Chen, Biao Lian</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall edge states in proximity to a superconductor (SC) usually acquire a non-quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability in transport, due to non-universal SC couplings and disorders. With counter-propagating modes, we show that the situation can be the opposite in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states with SC proximity, where disordered SC-couplings can reconstruct the edge states into an infinite set of stable phases with quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability along a long edge. Each phase is dominated by a disordered SC-coupling that tunnels $\pm |q_N|$ Cooper pairs, which can take values $|q_N|=1, 4, 15$, etc. We predict that this gives rise to a quantized downstream resistance $R_d = h/(2q^2_Ne^2)$ in an FQH-SC junction, serving as a quantized electrical transport signature beyond the Hall conductance. Higher-order nonlinear transport due to irrelevant Cooper pair tunneling or vortex dissipation is further studied, which becomes dominant when the edge is in a normal phase. Our results apply to both the single-layer state (as a particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/3$) and the bilayer Halperin-(112) state, revealing a rich landscape of disorder-stabilized phases in FQH edge states with SC proximity, and may as well apply to fractional Chern insulators recently observed at the same filling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans√§tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Simulating generalised fluids via interacting wave packets evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Urilyon, Leonardo Biagetti, Jitendra Kethepalli, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.</p>

            <h2>Overlap Gap and Computational Thresholds in the Square Wave Perceptron</h2>

            <p>Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed constraint density $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called \emph{overlap-gap property}, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous diffusion and directed coalescence of condensates out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andriy Goychuk</p>
            <p>Phase separation into domains with distinct composition and properties has widespread implications, ranging from alloys and emulsions to biomolecular condensates in cells. In living and nonliving matter, the organization of these domains can be controlled by nonequilibrium chemical reactions, external fields, or mechanical stresses. In this context, stationary states can emerge from long-range monopolar interactions analogous to electrostatics. More generally, as discussed here, because fluxes induce dipolar force fields, externally controlled boundary motion effectively polarizes the domain even for microscopically nonpolarizable matter. The dipole-dipole interactions resulting from this translation-induced polarization cause directed coalescence of domains. This coarsening mechanism complements Ostwald ripening and coalescence due to Brownian motion or Marangoni flows, and has implications for controlling domains by electric fields or concentration gradients. Interestingly, the chemical potential gradients around a domain that nucleates material are exactly opposite to the hydrodynamic pressure gradients around an impermeable colloid that pushes the fluid, suggesting a competition between phase separation and hydrodynamics. In addition to chemical control, the motion of domains can also be driven by mechanical stresses. An example is the cell interior, where mechanical stresses are actively generated by molecular motors and opposed by passive viscoelastic stresses in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. The resulting fluid flows lead to Brownian motion with a suppressed or enhanced size scaling which modifies collision-coalescence. For active stresses with a long correlation time, the domains show superdiffusion on intermediate time scales. Together, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of domains in viscoelastic media and conserved order parameters in general.</p>

            <h2>Exact zero modes in interacting Majorana X- and Y-junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowy M. La Rivi√®re, Rik Mulder, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of exact zero modes in junctions of two, three and four short interacting Majorana wires, equivalent to a chain with an impurity bond, Y- and X- junctions respectively. These exact zero modes are due to incommensurate short-range correlations induced by the interacting Majorana fermions, and they appear as unavoided level crossings between in-gap states upon continuously tuning the interaction. In a junction of only two chains we report exact zero modes and parity switching as soon as the coupling between the chains across a junction is positive. Remarkably, for junctions with multiple chains the in-gap states group up into sets of parity pairs -- pairs of states with opposite parity and similar energies. We demonstrate that the formation of these parity pairs are always due to the interaction of the outer edges of the junction. The behavior within each pair can be efficiently described by two coupled chains. In the Y-junction, we detect four in-gap states (two parity pairs) that show exact zero modes not only within each pair but also between them. This is attributed to an additional Majorana fermion localized at the center of junction that is protected by symmetry. Therefore, coupling between the Majorana fermions at the outer edges of the junction is mediated by that in the center. We argue that this is a generic feature of junctions with an odd number of arms. In the X-junction we detect eight in-gap states (four parity pairs) that are the result of two Majorana degrees of freedom localized at the center of the junction. However, we demonstrate that, by contrast to the Y-junction, the appearance of Majorana fermions at the center of the X-junction is not protected and the interaction across the junction can be tuned to the point where there are only Majorana fermions localized at the four outer edges of the junction, forming four in-gap states.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</p>

            <h2>Efficient optimization of variational tensor-network approach to three-dimensional statistical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia-Ze Xu, Tong-Yu Lin, Guang-Ming Zhang</p>
            <p>Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such a triple-layer network, which reduces the computational complexity while keeping high accuracy. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.</p>

            <p>We propose a programmable platform for engineering topological flat minibands by imposing a tunable electrostatic superlattice potential on a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled thin film subject to a Zeeman field. The interplay between the superlattice potential and Zeeman coupling produces an isolated flat miniband with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. Using many-body exact diagonalization, we show that this miniband supports fractional Chern insulators at filling factors $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$, both of which remain robust over broad parameter ranges. We further identify realistic material candidates and the corresponding device conditions that enable experimental realization. These results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for engineering topological flat minibands and exploring correlated topological phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Malosso, Edward Danquah Donkor, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali</p>
            <p>A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving nonabelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multidimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to nonabelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of nonabelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of nonabelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Morgan (1), Simon Cox (1) ((1) Department of Mathematics, Aberystwyth University, UK)</p>
            <p>Aqueous foams are subject to coarsening, whereby gas from the bubbles diffuses through the liquid phase. Gas is preferentially transported from small to large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and an increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to approach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties are invariant. However, a model predicting the experimentally observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state of foams with moderate liquid content, as a function of the liquid fraction $\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose a three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble adhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a prediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\phi$ from zero up to the unjamming transition $\phi_\text{c} \approx 36\%$. We verify that the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial conditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law. Comparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and experimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when $\phi > 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we attribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact with their neighbours, in our model.</p>

            <h2>Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pok Man Chiu</p>
            <p>We study the degree of band flatness and anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the lattice relaxation through optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth between two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of generalized optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Finally, we demonstrate that the condition of vanishing of flat band velocities and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case.</p>

            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has enabled physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented accessibility. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. An intriguing theoretical prediction of a characteristic phenomenon of BECs is anomalous tunneling, whereby low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy regime, and experimentally measure these frequencies using Oqtant. Our results reveal that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs, as well as highlight the potential of cloud-based experiments in quantum-body physics.</p>

It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.</p>

            <p>We study conditions of the appearance of $U(1)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress, they exhibit a linear kink and no kink otherwise for uniaxial and isotropic strain. Linear kink is absent for shear strain. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that $U(1)$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional [100] uniaxial strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper, we consider the effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of $T_c^{U(1)}$ and $T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.</p>

This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.</p>

            <p>The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</p>

In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit even-parity nonrelativistic spin splitting, odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have been proposed and emerged as a novel research frontier. In this study, we perform a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis to establish symmetry criteria for the emergence of OPMs. We identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs, enabling their realization in collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic orders. These OPMs are categorized into three types based on their spin textures for Bloch states: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). For type-I OPMs, we further delineate additional symmetry requirements for $p$-wave and $f$-wave spin splitting. We identify 48 candidate materials in the Magndata database that satisfy these symmetry criteria. Additionally, we construct two theoretical models to validate the effectiveness of the established symmetry criteria. Finally, we show that OPMs can exhibit an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and construct a theoretical model to realize this phase.</p>

Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the N√©el temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Yanyan Qian, Luxia Wang, Jin Luo Cheng</p>
            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Optical Control of Electron Dynamics in Patterned Graphene Nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riek H. R√ºstemeier, H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.</p>

            <h2>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Srivastav, Vivek Pandey, Brij Mohan, Arun Kumar Pati</p>
            <p>Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.</p>

            <h2>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andr√°s Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo</p>
            <p>We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</p>

            <h2>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Maillard</p>
            <p>Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta > 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau < \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau > \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau>\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the lower bound on the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the lower bound on the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive fundamental precision limits, dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectations of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are set by quantities such as dimensions and energy bandwidth, which depend only on the initial configuration and are independent of the dynamics. Using a quantum battery model, the fundamental precision limits show that there is a trade-off between the amount of energy storage and the charging precision. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental limits, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can improve the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhian Jia</p>
            <p>We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma C. King, Moritz Linnebacher, Peter P. Orth, Matteo Rizzi, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Fractional stochastic model of citation dynamics with memory and volatility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Okamura</p>
            <p>Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions yet also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime -- an apparent contradiction lacking a unified explanation. Here we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time ($t$) since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$, with $H$ constant. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process with cumulative advantage, modelled as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and volatility. We show that antipersistent fluctuations in attention ($H < 1/2$) yield log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent attention dynamics ($H > 1/2$) favour heavy-tailed power laws, thus resolving the log-normal--power-law contradiction. Numerical simulations confirm both the $t^{H}$ law and the transition between regimes. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints indicates that the latent attention process is intrinsically antipersistent ($H \approx 0.13$). By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations in attention to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.</p>

            <p>While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.</p>

For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions - the $\textit{monopoles}$ - proliferate.</p>

            <p>Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength and nature of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with a computationally efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics. Through two illustrative examples, we conduct initial-value simulations that show that, as the stiffness of the filament is decreased, the dynamic behaviour moves from rigid motion to planar buckling, through an out-of-plane transition, eventually reaching diffusive-like behaviours for very deformable filaments.</p>

While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems.

            <p>The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neil Dowling, Jacopo De Nardis, Markus Heinrich, Xhek Turkeshi, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</p>

The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</p>

Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</p>

            <h2>A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diyath Pannipitiya, Roland Roeder</p>
            <p>Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two. These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by M√ºller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Benjamin, Suzanne Bintanja, Yu-Jui Chen, Michael Gutperle, Conghuan Luo, Dikshant Rathore</p>
            <p>We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</p>

Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the quantum state of the generated harmonics of a driven Bose gas is a classical mixture, while below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation the emitted harmonic radiation is in a pure quantum state. These states furthermore exhibit squeezing and entanglement across all field modes.</p>

            <h2>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atma Anand</p>
            <p>Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</p>

            <p>Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riek H. R√ºstemeier, H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Predrag Nikoliƒá</p>
            <p>Raman scattering is emerging as a surprising probe of electron topology in quantum materials. It has been used recently to detect and characterize a topological phase transition that accompanies the magnetic transition in Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Here we present a theory of Raman scattering from nodal electrons with Weyl and quadratic band touching spectra, which has to reach beyond the standard effective mass approximation. After reviewing and providing the details of our previous theory development, we discuss several new results. We show that the light-polarization dependence of Raman scattering is universal in the case of Weyl electrons and given by an analytic expression, while it contains symmetry-protected features in the case of quadratic band-touching nodes. We also analyze modifications of the Raman signal due to the ubiquitous tilting of the Weyl spectrum, and argue that universality is lost only in a finite frequency range that springs out of the threshold frequency for untilted nodes. Finally, we explore the frequency dependence of Raman scattering for the case of Dirac electrons coexisting with a flat band in the same region of the first Brillouin zone, which is inspired by the material V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.</p>

            <p>In this work, we show that suitably designed spatially varying linearly polarized light provides a versatile route to generate and control pseudo-magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals through Floquet engineering. Within a high-frequency expansion, we derive an effective axial gauge potential $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$ whose curl gives the pseudo-magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_5(\mathbf{r})$. By mapping the light profile to $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$, we establish design principles for pseudo-magnetic field textures that mimic strain-induced gauge fields while offering key advantages like dynamic control, full reversibility, spatial selectivity, and absence of material deformation. We compare the Landau-level spectra produced by uniform real and pseudo-magnetic fields and also analyze both their linear optical conductivity and the second-order dc responses. Our results enable real-time manipulation of pseudo-magnetic fields and predict clear experimental signatures for optically engineered gauge fields in topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Hidden integer quantum ferroelectricity in chiral Tellurium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Luo, Sihan Deng, Muting Xie, Junyi Ji, Hongjun Xiang, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Ferroelectricity is a cornerstone of functional materials research, enabling diverse technologies from non-volatile memory to optoelectronics. Recently, type-I integer quantum ferroelectricity (IQFE), unconstrained by symmetry, has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated; however, as it arises from ionic displacements of an integer lattice vector, the initial and final states are macroscopically indistinguishable, rendering the physical properties unchanged. Here, we propose for the first time the nontrivial counterpart (i.e., type-II IQFE) where the polarization difference between the initial and final states is quantized but the macroscopical properties differ. We further demonstrate the existence of type-II IQFE in bulk chiral tellurium. In few-layer tellurium, the total polarization remains nearly quantized, composed of a bulk-inherited quantum component and a small surface-induced contribution. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal surface-initiated, layer-by-layer switching driven by reduced energy barriers, explaining why ferroelectricity was observed experimentally in few-layer tellurium, but not in bulk tellurium yet. Interestingly, the chirality of the initial and final states in bulk tellurium is opposite, suggesting a novel way to control structural chirality with electric field in chiral photonics and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Yu Wang, En-Qi Bao, Su-Yang Shen, Jun-Hui Yuan, Jiafu Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials have drawn extensive research interest due to their unique electronic properties, like flat bands, magnetic frustration, and topological quantum states, which enable precise quantum state control and novel device innovation. Yet, simultaneously achieving high stability, tunability, and multifunctionality in 2D kagome systems remains a key material design challenge. In this study, we innovatively propose a new paradigm for constructing two-dimensional multi-kagome-layer materials based on the "1+3" design concept. By seamlessly integrating high-throughput screening techniques, we have successfully identified 6,379 novel 2D multilayer kagome candidates from a vast pool of candidates. These materials exhibit a rich diversity of types, encompassing 173 metals, 27 semimetals, 166 ferromagnetic semiconductors, and as many as 6,013 semiconductors. Furthermore, based on the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, we conducted a detailed analysis of the flat-band characteristics of the energy bands near the Fermi level in the predicted systems. Our findings reveal that approximately two-thirds of the systems meet the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, and notably, several systems exhibit nearly perfect flat-band characteristics. Our work provides an excellent paradigm for the design and research of 2D multilayer kagome materials</p>

            <p>We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</p>

Our findings show that the observed cavity field displacement originates from dipole radiation within the cavity, rather than from a longitudinal coupling mechanism, yet exhibits the same signatures while relying on a transverse coupling. By carefully tuning the phase and amplitude of the intra-cavity field, we achieve a $\pi$-phase shift between two dipole states, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to its applications in quantum dot based qubits in cQED architectures, this protocol could serve as a new promising tool for probing exotic electronic states in mesoscopic circuits embedded in cavities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fluctuation-induced first-order breaking of time-reversal symmetry in unconventional superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Shi</p>
            <p>Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors with competing non-degenerate pairing channels is an exotic quantum phase transition that could give rise to robust topological superconductivity and unusual magnetism. It is proposed mostly in two-dimensional systems and is signaled by a nonzero relative phase between the two superconducting order parameters, hence it should particularly be prone to order-parameter phase fluctuations. Nevertheless, the existing understanding of it is still at the mean-field level. Here, we illustrate the non-negligible effects of the phase fluctuations on such quantum phase transitions using the hole-doped square-lattice $t$-$J$ model as an example. We derive the phase fluctuation-corrected free energy and show that under the quantum phase fluctuations, the time-reversal asymmetric $s+id$ phase region splits off a dome featuring a first-order border with the $d$ phase, indicating the possibility of a phase separation into the time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric phases. The phase fluctuations also narrow the range of the $s+id$ phase considerably. We further discuss the implications of our findings for recent experiments on disorder-induced first-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity and promising high-temperature topological superconductivity in twisted cuprate Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>The coexistence of topological magnons and electrons in magnetic materials presents a compelling route toward developing low-dissipation, multifunctional spintronic devices. However, material systems enabling their simultaneous realization and control remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose the coexistence and concurrent tunability of magnonic and electronic Chern insulator phases in Kitaev magnets and use MnBr$_{3}$ monolayer as a prototype. We find the significant Kitaev interaction in MnBr$_{3}$ induces the magnonic Chern insulator phase, manifesting as the magnon thermal Hall effect. Concurrently, MnBr$_{3}$ exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect driven by its electronic Chern insulator phase. Crucially, we demonstrate that these dual topological phases can be simultaneously controlled by reorienting the in-plane spins with an external magnetic field. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of spin excitations in Kitaev magnets but also provide a promising platform for exploring the interplay between electronic and magnonic topology.</p>

            <p>Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.</p>

            <p>High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer a unique platform for exploring the thermodynamic interaction between configurational entropy and enthalpy in stabilizing complex solid solutions. In this study, a series of rock-salt structured oxides with varying configurational entropy, ranging from binary to multi-cation systems, to elucidate the competing roles of enthalpy and entropy in phase stabilization is investigated. Compositions including (Ni$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)O to(NiCuZnCoMg)$_{0.9}$A$_{0.1}$O (A = Li, Na, K) were synthesized and their stuctural, microstructural and thermal properties have been discussed. X-ray diffraction combined with thermal cycling confirms that even a medium configurational entropy ($\sim$ 0.95R) can induce single-phase behavior stabilized by configurational entropy ($\Delta S_{conf}$), challenging the traditional threshold of $1.5\,R$. High-resolution TEM and EDS mapping reveal nanocrytalline features and homogeneous elemental distribution respectively, while XPS analysis confirms divalent oxidation states. A strong coupling between high configurational entropy with thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) has been observed. First, a sharp decrease in $\kappa$ with increasing $\Delta S_{conf}$ is seen and then decomposed samples (while cooling) show high $\kappa$, demonstrating the role of $\Delta S_{conf}$ on $\kappa$. Furthermore, Li-doped compositions exhibit improved thermoelectric performance, with a maximum figure of merit ($zT$) of $\sim$0.15 at 1173K\, driven by low thermal conductivity and favorable carrier transport. The results highlight that configurational entropy, even at intermediate values, plays a significant role in stabilizing disordered single-phase oxides and tailoring phonon transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenlin Zhang, Wei Hu, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems hosting excitons, dissipation mechanisms critically shape the excitonic dynamics, band-structure and topological properties. A microscopic understanding of excitons in such non-Hermitian settings demands a first-principles generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Building on a recently introduced nonequilibrium Green's function formalism compatible with Lindbladian dynamics, we derive a non-Hermitian BSE from diagrammatic perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, and obtain a microscopic excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates dissipation while preserving causality. We apply the formalism to valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to structured photon baths. We uncover a rich landscape of exceptional points in momentum space, forming either discrete sets or continuous manifolds, depending on bath structure. The exceptional points give rise to nonanalytic valley-polarization, unusual polarization pattern in photoluminescence, and nontrivial topological signatures. Our results establish a first-principles framework for predicting and controlling excitonic behavior in open quantum materials, showing how engineered environments can be leveraged to induce and manipulate non-Hermitian and topological properties.</p>

Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</p>

            <p>Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, yet a major gap persists between complex, data-hungry deep learning models and the practical demands of state-of-the-art scientific measurements. To fundamentally bridge this gap, we propose deep prior-based denoising, a robust deep learning model that requires no training data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by removing grid artifacts in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a long-standing and critical data analysis challenge in materials science. Our results demonstrate that deep prior-based denoising yields clearer ARPES images in a fraction of the time required by conventional, experiment-based denoising methods. This ultra-efficient approach to ARPES will enable high-speed, high-resolution three-dimensional band structure mapping in momentum space, thereby dramatically accelerating our understanding of microscopic electronic structures of materials. Beyond ARPES, deep prior-based denoising represents a versatile tool that could become a new standard in any advanced scientific measurement fields where data acquisition is limited.</p>

At room temperature, we observe optically detected magnetic resonance in these systems at zero magnetic field and a strong magneto-photoluminescence (10% modulation at 2 mT applied magnetic field). Distinct photoluminescence bands (at 630 nm and 700 nm) show opposite-sign spin-optical responses, arising from spin-selective intersystem crossing between triplet and singlet manifolds. These bright, all-organic diradicals offer a new set of chemically tunable materials for room temperature spin-optical interfaces, paving the way for application as quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>Functional nanomaterials, including 2D materials and their heterostructures are expected to impact fields ranging from catalysis, optoelectronics to nanophotonics. To realize their potential, novel experimental approaches need to be developed to characterize the combined materials and their components. Techniques using fast electrons, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), probe phenomena over an unrivaled energy range with high resolution. In addition, momentum-resolved EELS simultaneously records energy and momentum transfer to the sample and thus generates two-dimensional data sets for each beam position. This allows excitations that occur at large momentum transfer to be resolved, including those outside of the light cone and beyond the first Brillouin zone, all whilst retaining nanometer sized spatial selectivity. Such capabilities are particularly important when probing phonons, plasmons, excitons and their coupling in 2D materials and their heterostructures.</p>

The system consists of $N$ continuous spin variables in the interval $[-1,1]$. Dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, accurately identifying the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and allows estimation of critical exponents. Additionally, variational autoencoders are implemented to study the phase transition through the loss function, which behaves as an order parameter. A correlation function between real and reconstructed data is defined and found to be universal at the critical point.</p>

            <h2>Self-Consistent Fourier-Tschebyshev Representations of the First Normal Stress Difference in Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas King, Eugene Pashkovski, Reid Patterson, Paige Rockwell, Gareth H. McKinley</p>
            <p>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) is a key technique for characterizing nonlinear viscoelasticity in a wide range of materials. Most research to date has focused on the shear stress response to an oscillatory strain input. However, for highly elastic materials such as polymer melts, the time-varying first normal stress difference $N_1(t;\omega,\gamma_0)$ can become much larger than the shear stress at sufficiently large strains, serving as a sensitive probe of the material's nonlinear characteristics. We present a Fourier-Tschebyshev framework for decomposing the higher-order spectral content of the $N_1$ material functions generated in LAOS. This new decomposition is first illustrated through analysis of the second-order and fourth-order responses of the quasilinear Upper Convected Maxwell model and the fully nonlinear Giesekus model. We then use this new framework to analyze experimental data on a viscoelastic silicone polymer and a thermoplastic polyurethane melt. Furthermore, we couple this decomposition with the recently developed Gaborheometry strain sweep technique to enable rapid and quantitative determination of the $N_1$ material function from experimental normal force data obtained in a single sweep from small to large strain amplitudes. We verify that asymptotic connections between the oscillatory shear stress and $N_1$ in the quasilinear limit are satisfied for the experimental data, ensuring self-consistency. This framework for analyzing the first normal stress difference is complementary to the established framework for analyzing the shear stresses in LAOS, and augments the content of material-specific data sets, hence more fully quantifying the important nonlinear viscoelastic properties of a wide range of soft materials.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the existence of a frequency band exhibiting acoustic transparency in 2D and 3D dense granular suspensions, enabling the transmission of a low-frequency ballistic wave excited by a high-frequency broadband ultrasound pulse. This phenomenon is attributed to spatial correlations in the structural disorder of the medium. To support this interpretation, we use an existing model that incorporates such correlations via the structure factor. Its predictions are shown to agree well with those of the Generalized Coherent Potential Approximation (GCPA) model, which is known to apply at high volume fractions, including the close packing limit, but does not explicitly account for disorder correlation. Within the transparency band, attenuation is found to be dominated by absorption rather than scattering. Measurements of the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient reveal significant deviations from conventional models, challenging the current understanding of acoustic absorption in dense granular media.</p>

            <p>Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems in soft robotics and smart structures.</p>

            <p>Platinum, to date, is the most widely applied electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It is assumed to be a proton-blocking catalyst with only surface-limited adsorption of the reaction intermediates. Here, we critically evaluate the bulk interaction of Pt with hydrogen (H), and its heavier isotope deuterium (D), by monitoring operando mass change of the Pt electrode during galvanostatic heavy/water splitting by employing an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Unexpectedly, we observe an irreversible temporal mass gain and a change in the reaction's overpotential, arising from diffusion of H/D into Pt, confirmed by atom probe tomography and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Sub-surface concentration of at least ca. 15 at. % of D in Pt was observed, diffusing down to a depth of more than 10 nm. Analytical description quantified the diffusion coefficient of D in Pt to be 3.2X10^-18 cm2Xs-1. These findings challenge the existing credence of Pt-proton interaction being limited to the surface, prompting the expansion of the catalyst design strategies to account for property-modifying bulk diffusion of H/D in the Pt matrix</p>

In this letter, we theoretically investigate the optical injection of orbital polarization by means of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge and we show that the latter considerably exceeds 100% for holes and photon energies close to the direct Ge gap. These results suggest that Ge is a convenient platform for future development of orbitronics and opto-orbitronic devices.</p>

            <p>The development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for clean energy conversion remains a central challenge in materials science. Although platinum serves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family monolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic, vibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation functionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band gap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical stability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these findings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the computed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a sustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation UV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral graphene (rG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host flat bands that stabilize various strongly correlated quantum phases, including Mott insulators, integer, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases. In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to visualize the dispersion of flat bands with doping and applied displacement fields in a hBN-aligned rhombohedral trilayer graphene (rtG)/hBN moir√© superlattice. In addition to the intrinsic flat bands of rtG induced by the displacement field, we observe low-energy features originating from moir√© potential-induced band folding. Real-space variations of the spectroscopic features allow us to quantify the spatial structure of the moir√© potential at the rtG/hBN interface. Importantly, we find that accurately capturing the moir√© site-dependent spectra requires incorporating a moir√© potential acting on the top graphene layer with a sign opposite to that of the bottom layer into the continuum model. Our results thus provide key experimental and theoretical insights into understanding the role of the moire superlattice in rG/hBN heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We investigated trioxatriangulenium functionalized with phenyl (phenyl-TOTA) on the (111) surfaces of Ag and Au using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). On Ag(111), the molecules form hexagonal arrays, and on Au(111), honeycomb patterns are also observed. The orientations of the phenyl moieties are resolved on both substrates. On Ag(111), the orientations are parallel within a row and they differ by approximately $60^\circ$ between adjacent molecular rows, and STM images suggest dimerization of the molecules. DFT calculations for Ag(111) reveal that van der Waals interactions dominate this system. The optimized structure matches the experimental pattern, and the simulated STM images exhibit apparent dimerization. This dimerization results from an asymmetry of the phenyl wavefunction, which reflects intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the ligand and an oxygen atom within the triangulenium platform. The orientation of the phenyl moieties is explained by the interaction of each phenyl moiety with its triangulenium platform combined with the direct long-range interaction between phenyl moieties across molecules.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor photocatalysis offers a sustainable route for converting solar energy into chemical energy, enabling the production of clean fuels and valuable chemical products. To this aim, we explore van der Waals heterostructures made up of Janus PtSSe and WXY (X, Y $=$ S, Se, Te and X $\neq$Y), in the context of photocatalytic applications. The redox capabilities of various heterostructure configurations (atom facing types and stacking orders) are evaluated by aligning the absolute band edge positions with respect to redox potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. The stability of photocatalyst candidates are checked by layer binding energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The optical absorption spectra suggest good light absorption in the visible range. Further, strain engineering is applied as a way to tune band edges and evaluate the possible use of the heterostructures as photocatalysts. This study shows that van der Waals heterostructure bilayers composed of Janus PtSSe and WSeTe in specific geometric configurations can be potential materials as photocatalysts for HER, OER and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. Finally, we suggest that, although systems made up of PtSSe and WSTe cannot be used for photocatalytic applications, they can be explored for applications in thermoelectric energy conversion or infrared photovoltaics.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</p>

            <p>In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a R√©nyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</p>

            <p>We present a nonperturbative tensor-network approach to the excitation spectra of superconducting circuits based on Josephson junction arrays. These arrays provide the large lumped inductances required for qubit designs, yet their intrinsically many-body nature is typically reduced to effective single-mode descriptions. Perturbative treatments attempt to include the collective array modes neglected in these approximations, but a fully nonperturbative analysis is challenging due to the many-body structure and the collective character of these modes. We overcome this difficulty using the DMRG-X algorithm, which extends tensor-network methods to excited states. Our key advance is a construction of trial states from the linearized mode structure, enabling direct computation of excitations, even in degenerate manifolds, which was previously inaccessible. Our results reveal significant deviations from, and allow us to improve upon, previous perturbative treatments in the regime of low array junction impedance.</p>

            <p>We investigate the modulational instability of uniform wave packets governed by a discrete third-order nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation in finite square lattices, modeling light propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U > 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by applying a tunable imaginary gauge transformation on the platform of the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. From the measured topology of the Riemann surface, we reveal the complex-energy winding, the open-boundary-condition spectrum, the generalized Brillouin zone, and the branch points. Our findings demonstrate a unified framework in the studies of diverse effects in non-Hermitian topological physics through an experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surfaces.</p>

            <p>Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</p>

            <p>The storage of large-scale quantum information at finite temperature requires an autonomous and reliable quantum hard drive, also known as a self-correcting quantum memory. It is a long-standing open problem to find a self-correcting quantum memory in three dimensions. The recently introduced Layer Codes achieve the best possible scaling of code parameters and logical energy barrier in three dimensions, these are tantalizing features for the purposes of self-correction. In this work we show that a family of Layer Codes, based on good Quantum Tanner Codes, exhibit partial self-correction. Their memory time grows exponentially with linear system size, up to a length scale that is exponential in the inverse temperature. At this length scale, the memory time scales as a double exponential of inverse temperature. To establish this result we introduce a concatenated matching decoder that combines three rounds of parallelized minimum-weight perfect-matching with a decoder for good Quantum Tanner Codes. We show that our decoder corrects errors up to a constant fraction of the energy barrier, and a constant fraction of the code distance, for a family of Layer Codes. Our results position Layer Codes as the leading candidate for a partially self-correcting memory in three dimensions. While they fall short of achieving strict self-correction in the thermodynamic limit, our work highlights the potential of these local codes in three dimensions, with fast distance and logical qubit growth, fast decoders, and a long memory time over a wide range of parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</p>

            <p>On-chip optical architectures that enable angle-resolved spectroscopy are essential for advancing photonic platforms towards low-volume, scalable, and cryo-compatible devices. Here, we introduce spatially resolved momentum-space imaging using arrays of 3D-printed microlenses directly integrated onto semiconductor optical microcavities. Each microlens functions as an independent optical element with a high numerical aperture (approx. 0.95), enabling parallel back focal plane imaging across, in our implementation, 64 distinct locations. This approach eliminates the need for bulky microscope objectives while maintaining broad wavevector access, even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate its versatility across various cavity systems, including dielectric planar resonators, GaAs-based polariton microcavities, and CdTe platforms supporting nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons. The microlenses not only enhance collection efficiency but also enable tightly focused excitation, yielding an order of magnitude reduction in condensation thresholds compared with conventional setups. Our results establish 3D-printed microlens arrays as a compact, versatile, integrated platform for next-generation angle-resolved spectroscopy in nanophotonics and quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We present a novel acousto-optic lens (AOL) design for neutral atom quantum computing. This approach enhances atom rearrangement in optical tweezer arrays and addresses the speed limitations imposed by the cylindrical lensing effect of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). By combining a double-pass AOD configuration for dynamic focal tuning with a standard pair of crossed AODs for transverse beam steering, our design enables the generation of arbitrary focal point trajectories. This configuration enables shuttling of atoms in 3D space, thereby helping to realise fully connected two-qubit gates and mid-circuit measurements. We detail the optical implementation, characterize its performance, and discuss its applications in scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Understanding How Synthetic Impurities Affect Glyphosate Solubility and Crystal Growth Using Free Energy Calculations and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h2>

            <p>Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kay Joerg Wiese</p>
            <p>We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. This is similar to what was used to locate the complex CFT of the 5-state Potts model in dimension $d=2$ [PRL 133 (2024) 077101]. There it was shown that a CFT is characterized by a stationarity condition for the measured effective central charge. Our strategy is to write the ground-state energy as $E_{\rm GS}(N)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] with good precision, and their sweet spot as well. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling dynamical quantum error correcting codes via non-invertible symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajath Radhakrishnan, Adar Sharon, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn</p>
            <p>Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Miguel Barriuso G., Jose Martin-Roca, Valentino Bianco, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Chantal Valeriani</p>
            <p>We study active agents embedded in bulk or in confinement explicitly considering hydrodynamics and simulating the swimmers via an implementation inspired by the squirmer model. We develop a Dissipative Particle Dynamics scheme for the solvent. This approach allows us to properly deal not only with hydrodynamics but also with thermal fluctuations. On the other side, this approach enables us to study active agents with complex shapes, ranging from spherical colloids to polymers. To start with, we study a simple spherical colloid. We analyze the features of the velocity fields of the surrounding solvent, when the colloid is a pusher, a puller or a neutral swimmer either in bulk or confined in a cylindrical channel. Next, we characterise its dynamical behaviour by computing the mean square displacement and the long time diffusion when the active colloid is in bulk or in a channel (varying its radius) and analyze the orientation autocorrelation function in the latter case. While the three studied squirmer types are characterised by the same bulk diffusion, the cylindrical confinement considerably modulates the diffusion and the orientation autocorrelation function. Finally, we focus our attention on a more complex shape: an active polymer. We first characterise the structural features computing its radius of gyration when in bulk or in cylindrical confinement, and compare to known results obtained without hydrodynamics. Next, we characterise the dynamical behaviour of the active polymer by computing its mean square displacement and the long time diffusion. On the one hand, both diffusion and radius of gyration decrease due to the hydrodynamic interaction when the system is in bulk. On the other hand, the effect of confinement is to decrease the radius of gyration, disturbing the motion of the polymer and thus reducing its diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Terahertz Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingda Zhang, Su Ying Quek</p>
            <p>Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first-principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero-field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high-fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realising a single-photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, highlighting the opportunities for next generation THz quantum technologies - an area of growing interest given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Preethi Gopalakrishnan, Shovan Dutta</p>
            <p>Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits forming a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining over 75000 networks of different families with tunable structural properties, we demonstrate that (i) heterogeneity in the number of neighbors is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) apart from the number of neighbors, the key determinant is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the frustration level. In fact, one can vary the magnetization throughout its range by embedding such hubs. We also discuss simple, exactly solvable networks where such tunability leads to both abrupt and continuous transitions, with quantum effects giving rise to a diverging susceptibility. Our findings can be realized on emerging platforms and pose a number of fundamental questions, strongly motivating wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena on complex networks.</p>

            <h2>Disorder operators in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study the disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asymptotically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of the Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</p>

            <p>The properties of alloys that undergo to chemical order-disorder transformations depend heavily on the degree of ordering in the crystal lattice. In particular, the ordering in a magnetic alloy like Fe-rich (x>0.5) Fe_xAl_1-x, for example, leads typically to reducing its magnetization and even to a transition from the ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) state at x<0.7. Our study was focused on the kinetics of ordering in thin Fe_xAl_1-x films of a nonstoichiometric composition (0.5<x<0.7). We demonstrate that, when the alloy is aged at a sufficiently high temperature, the formation of a chemically ordered structure is accompanied by an increase in magnetization and related functional properties, such as the anomalous Hall (AH) resistivity. We believe that these properties improve owing to the segregation of Fe and its precipitation outside the growing nuclei of the ordered B2-Fe_0.5Al_0.5 phase. The driving force for the Fe segregation we observe is associated with the squeezing out of excess Fe into the surrounding matrix by growing B2 nuclei. Simulations of the B2 nucleation process, performed using the molecular dynamics method, confirm our experimental findings. The results we report contrast to previous studies, which assumed that the growth of the B2 phase in alloys such as Fe_xAl_1-x (0.5<x<0.7) occurred through the mechanism of continuous ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amar Kumar, Sujeet Chaudhary, Sharat Chandra</p>
            <p>Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs), novel quantum materials, are notable for their tunable spin-transport properties. Considering that the SGS materials might have an invariably deformed lattice upon integration into devices, and given that the SGS nature is highly sensitive to external factors, the impact of lattice distortions on the different physical properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy has been investigated using density functional theory calculations. For lattice distortions, the uniform strain corresponding to $-6\% \leq \Delta V / V_0 \leq 6\% \quad (a: 5.60\text{-}5.83~\text√Ö)$, and the tetragonal distortion corresponding to $0.8 \leq c/a \leq 1.2 \quad (a: 5.38\text{-}6.16~\text√Ö,~c: 4.92\text{-}6.45~\text√Ö)$ are modelled. All uniformly strained CoFeCrGa structures are found to display SGS character, magnetic isotropy, small anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), and small spin Hall conductivity (SHC) - closely resembling those of the ideal CoFeCrGa structure. In contrast, the tetragonally deformed structures display nearly half-metallic behavior with very high spin polarization, very large magnetic anisotropy ($ \sim 10^6~\mathrm{J/m^3}$), and very large AHC ranging from ($ -215 \text{ to } 250~\mathrm{S/cm} $) depending on the axial ratio of the distorted structure. The SHC, however, does not change significantly under tetragonal distortion and remains nearly of the same order as that of the Y-I ordered structure. In summary, these findings demonstrate that CoFeCrGa displays favorable spintronic properties even under lattice distortions, underscoring its potential for next-generation spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Zubeltzu, Fernando Bresme, Matthew Dawber, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Emilio Artacho</p>
            <p>Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarizability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used, understanding the interplay between electronic and ionic contributions becomes critical, contrary to what is widely assumed. This highlights the importance of electronic degrees of freedom in interpreting the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</p>

We first propose a coarse-grained model describing random particle exchanges between two reservoirs with constant rates, from which the upper bound emerges. We then rigorously prove the inequality in quantum ballistic transport systems. Finally, we demonstrate its validity in two specific diffusive systems: the exclusion process, for which the inequality can be proven, and charged-particle transport, for which numerical evidence supports the inequality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Gabriele, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco, Filomena Forte</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. We also show that HHG is particularly sensitive to dynamical rotational-symmetry breaking, as even high-order components can be modulated by a time-dependent symmetry breaking. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials, and provide novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.</p>

            <p>We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$ index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain broader bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where the quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental bismuth realizing a nontrivial even spin-Chern number. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses and show their robustness in the presence of disorder within a real space marker formulation, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry is observable in realistic experimental settings of impure materials. Finally, we connect spin bounds to quantum Cram√©r-Rao bounds that are central to quantum metrology, showing that elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</p>

In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.</p>

            <p>Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr√©chet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.</p>

The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeshi Mizushima, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the TPT by exploiting the static and dynamical density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses, the density response including the effect of Coulomb interactions, reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</p>

            <p>Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to explicitly evaluate this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. In this paper, we describe the hierarchical autoregressive network (HAN) algorithm in three spatial dimensions and study its performance using the example of the Ising model. We compare HAN with three other autoregressive architectures and the classical Wolff cluster algorithm. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamic observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as entropy and free energy, in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Fabbri, Alessandro Giuliani, Robin Reuvers</p>
            <p>The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</p>

            <h2>Domain Wall Sliding-induced Polarization Switching in Multilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhou Zhou, Xiyao Peng, Jianfeng Bi, Fei Xue, Jie Jiang, Huizhen Wu, Zhiwen Shi, Haoliang Qian, Toshikaze Kariyado, Sihan Zhao</p>
            <p>Electric polarization and metallicity are long believed not to coexist until the emergence of exceptionally rare material examples including the bulk polar metals and more recently two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials such as 1T' WTe2. The electric polarization for the latter represents a new and distinguishable paradigm in materials science and physics because its electric polarization states embedded in the conduction electron sea are able to couple with (and controlled by) the external electric field. However, the microscopic polarization switching process and mechanism in these 2D vdW metallic materials have not been experimentally observed and remain elusive. Here, we report the first direct experimental imaging of the microscopic mechanism behind electric-field-coupled polarization switching in a metallic system. Our gate-tunable nanoscale optical imaging identifies the robust coexistence of electric polarization and appreciable carrier densities in adjacent polar domains hosting opposite electric polarizations in a 2D elemental metallic material, tetralayer graphene. We directly visualize and verify that the sliding domain wall (DW) solitons confined at the middlemost interface are responsible for the polarization switching in tetralayer graphene upon the application of electric fields and mechanical forces. Our work provides the first direct visualization of domain wall sliding-induced polarization switching in 2D elemental carbon at room temperature, significantly expanding and advancing the research of "ferroelectric metal" initially dubbed by P. W. Anderson and coauthors in 1965.</p>

            <h2>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. I. Mukhin</p>
            <p>A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.</p>

            <p>The Einstein-de Haas effect is a phenomenon in which angular momentum is transferred from microscopic spins to mechanical rotation of a rigid body. Here, we report the first observation of the Einstein-de Haas effect in a spinor-dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate where quantized vortices emerge in depolarized spinor components through coherent angular-momentum transfer from microscopic atomic spins to macroscopic quantized circulation. Experimental results clearly show that the spherical symmetry of the condensate is dynamically broken into the axisymmetry by an intrinsic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.</p>

            <p>We show that vortices with circulating current, related with odd-frequency triplet pairing, appear in Josephson junctions where the barrier is a weak ferromagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. By symmetry analysis we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. Using a microscopic model based on a modified Usadel equation incorporating those effects, we show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the pairing amplitudes can form a texture.</p>

            <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

            <h2>Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilanjan Roy, Subroto Mukerjee, Sumilan Banerjee</p>
            <p>We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-Andr√©-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</p>

            <p>Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We confirm the presence of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo M. Yoshitome, Heitor Casasola, Rodrigo Corso, Pedro R. S. Gomes</p>
            <p>We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Alja≈æ Godec</p>
            <p>We construct dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for several cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. Only allowing for single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, only accounting for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Moreover, combining the different dynamics gives a large number of further models. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. C√©pas, G. Masbaum, P. Qu√©merais</p>
            <p>The Aubry transition is a phase transition between two types of incommensurate states, originally described as a transition by ``breaking of analyticity''. Here we present Denjoy's (anachronistic) viewpoint, who almost hundred years ago described certain mathematical properties of circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers. The connection between the two lies in the existence of a change of variables from the incommensurate ground state variables to new simple phase variables that rotate by a constant irrational angle. This confers a cyclic order, an essential property of models with the Aubry transition. Denjoy's description indicates that there are two types of cyclic order, distinguished by the regular or singular nature of the change of variables or, in mathematical terms, by the distinction between topological conjugacy versus semiconjugacy. This allows rephrasing the breaking of analyticity as a breaking of topological conjugacy. We illustrate this description with numerical calculations on the Frenkel-Kontorova model.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L√©vy.</p>

            <p>Dirac semimetals can be classified into types I, II, and III based on the topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system can be sliced into a family of kz-dependent normal and topological insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a 2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator. To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points, one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in a single system. Here, we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals by a special Floquet driving that preserves time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. M. Beltukov, A. V. Rodina, A. Alekseev, Al. L. Efros</p>
            <p>Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. Near such interfaces, a charged particle creates a singular self-interaction potential which may be attributed to interaction with fictitious mirror charges. The singularity of this interaction at the interface presents an obstruction to a perturbative approach. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we have developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with a dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the energy spectrum of quantum wells (QWs) at the interface with the vacuum or a high-k dielectric. For a surface of liquid helium, we estimate the parameter W, and match the resulting electron spectrum with the existing experimental data and theoretical analysis.</p>

            <p>The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KH$_2$PO$_4$ (KDP), we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.</p>

            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--H√ºckel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun</p>
            <p>Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</p>

            <p>In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile, reconfigurable storage devices. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyan Wang, Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.</p>

            <p>We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</p>

            <p>Objective: This work aims to demonstrate a low-power, biomimetic auditory sensing concept for fully implantable cochlear implants. The approach draws inspiration from the frequency selectivity and temporal encoding of the cochlea, and uses neuromorphic spike generation to replace conventional signal processing blocks. The goal is to establish a compact, energy-efficient front-end architecture suitable for future implantable systems. Methods: An auditory sensing unit was implemented, consisting of a piezoelectric MEMS cantilever mechanically coupled to a single VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator. This configuration enables FFT-free, frequency-selective sensing and direct spike generation, forming a biomimetic auditory front end. The concept was experimentally examined using controlled mechanical excitation. Results: The sensing unit exhibited frequency-selective detection of mechanical vibrations in the nanometer to tens-of-nanometers displacement range and generated biomimetic spiking waveforms. Spike rate-encoding of the input amplitude was demonstrated, with output spiking frequencies tunable between approximately 100 Hz and 1 kHz depending on the excitation level. The waveform was finally converted to a biphasic shape suitable for cochlear implant stimulation. Significance: Temporal encoding is fundamental to natural auditory signal processing in the nervous system. By implementing this principle through neuromorphic spike encoding, the proposed approach can provide significant benefits for cochlear implants. In addition, the circuit has the potential to reduce footprint, energy consumption, and latencies compared with current commercial solutions.</p>

            <h2>Projected Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of quantum spins for spin wave theory</h2>

            <p>The Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of quantum spins and associated large-$S$ expansion have been the standard framework for describing the spin wave excitations in magnetically order phases of quantum spin systems. However, we will show that the omission of projection operators and normal-ordering in this representation can produce incorrect magnon hamiltonians for finite $S$. We will present the exact normal-ordered forms of the finite-$S$ projection operators and projected Holstein-Primakoff boson representations of spin and quadrupole operators, which can produce exact two-magnon interaction terms under ferromagnetic or fully polarized states. We will also discuss the difficulties of applying this projected representation to antiferromagnetic spin wave theory.</p>

            <p>We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.</p>

            <h2>Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanja Mariƒá, Luka Paljk, Lenart Zadnik</p>
            <p>We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.</p>

            <h2>Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Yanyan Qian, Luxia Wang, Jin Luo Cheng</p>
            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <h2>Strong Characterization for the Airy Line Ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amol Aggarwal, Jiaoyang Huang</p>
            <p>In this paper we show that a Brownian Gibbsian line ensemble whose top curve approximates a parabola must be given by the parabolic Airy line ensemble. More specifically, we prove that if $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} = (\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2, \ldots )$ is a line ensemble satisfying the Brownian Gibbs property, such that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a constant $\mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) > 0$ with $$\mathbb{P} \Big[ \big| \mathcal{L}_1 (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2 \big| \le \varepsilon t^2 + \mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) \Big] \ge 1 - \varepsilon, \qquad \text{for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$},$$ then $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}$ is the parabolic Airy line ensemble, up to an independent affine shift. Specializing this result to the case when $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2$ is translation-invariant confirms a prediction of Okounkov and Sheffield from 2006 and Corwin-Hammond from 2014.</p>

            <p>We study torsional topological defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in ($4+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the holographic interpretation, these correspond to crystalline dislocation defects associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling is fixed at the Chern-Simons point. By solving the equations of motion through an asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that the dual ($3+1$)-dimensional theory admits axially symmetric solutions. These solutions describe holographic materials with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded by a black hole in the bulk. At the same time, they feature ring-shaped defects arising from the background Riemann-Cartan geometry, characterized by nontrivial Burgers vectors. We also discuss the possible appearance of an odd-parity Abelian holographic anomaly, proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results motivate further studies of holographic defects using bulk gravitational theories and support the view that torsion provides a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</p>

            <h2>Observable-projected ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Milekhin, Sara Murciano</p>
            <p>Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</p>

            <h2>Filtering out mislabeled training instances using black-box optimization and quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Asker, Mohamed Swailem, Uwe C. T√§uber, Mauro Mobilia</p>
            <p>Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</p>

            <h2>Discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free discrete time crystals (DTCs) in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time first grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and is then saturated, which depends on the energy density of the initial state. Since thermalization of the effective Hamiltonian is slow, there is no typical prethermalization and PDTCs in the Floquet system before final thermalization. The robustness of DTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order</p>

We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the two-dimensional square-lattice $XX$ model [T.I.

Using the infinite projected entangled pair state, we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions. This finding contradicts the quantum simulation data where the correlation length seems to obey KZ-like power laws, although with modified exponents.</p>

            <p>We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst</p>
            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

            <h2>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hesam Arabzadeh, Dmitri Kireev</p>
            <p>Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</p>

            <h2>Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian N√§gele, Florian Marquardt</p>
            <p>The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</p>

The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.</p>

            <h2>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee</p>
            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

The calculations performed for a large number of inorganic crystalline compounds with metal, covalent and ionic bonding (including diamond, Mg, sphalerite, B, magnesium carboboride, topaz, rocksalt, etc.) within the pressure range from -20 GPa to 300 GPa demonstrated an excellent agreement with the predictions of the analytical theory.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omri Lesser, Yanjun Liu, Natalie Maus, Aaditya Panigrahi, Krishnanand Mallayya, Leslie M. Schoop, Jacob R. Gardner, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
            <p>Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93 and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties. Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for predictive modeling of diverse material properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengzhi Wu, Zhou-Quan Wan, Shao-Kai Jian, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</p>

            <h2>Measuring intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors using nonlinear response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-En Tseng, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>We discuss intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors, and how they may be measured using non-linear optical (terahertz) response. We consider both $s$ and $d$-wave superconductors, both with and without a phenomenological (energy dependent) damping. Intrinsic relaxation rates of interest include the Higgs mode decay rate, the quasiparticle redistribution rate ($1/T_1$) and the quasiparticle dephasing rate ($1/T_2$), where the latter two rates are zero in the pure BCS model, but non-zero in the presence of damping. Using the Anderson pseudospin formalism, we illustrate how these intrinsic relaxation rates are related to measurable quantities such as the time-dependent gap function and the non-linear current (a.k.a. third harmonic generation). Hence, we show how intrinsic relaxation rates may be experimentally extracted and discuss what one may thereby learn about the underlying damping. We also discuss the effects of polarization control (viz. non-linear response to light polarized in different directions), which offers a useful experimental knob, especially for $d$-wave superconductors, enabling selective excitation of modes in different irreducible representations (and readout of their corresponding relaxation rates).</p>

            <p>To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit, requires careful optimization of competing quality metrics. We systematically compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models, creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and disorder are limiting factors.</p>

Josephson coupling of the weak links and electron density in the plaquettes are independently controlled by separate electrostatic gates. Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with experiment.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.</p>

Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities.

In addition, we examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems. As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar interactions.

Employing micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</p>

            <p>Topological effects arising from the Berry curvature lead to intriguing transport signatures in quantum materials. Two such phenomena are the chiral anomaly and nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). A unified description of these transport regimes requires a quantitative treatment of both band topology and electron scattering. Here, we show accurate predictions of the magnetoresistance in topological semimetals and NLHE in noncentrosymmetric materials by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon ($e$-ph) scattering and Berry curvature computed from first principles. We apply our method to study magnetotransport in a prototypical Weyl semimetal, TaAs, and the NLHE in strained monolayer WSe$_2$, bilayer WTe$_2$ and bulk BaMnSb$_2$. In TaAs, we find a chiral contribution to the magnetoconductance which is positive and increases with magnetic field, consistent with experiments. We show that $e$-ph interactions can significantly modify the Berry curvature dipole and its dependence on temperature and Fermi level, highlighting the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions in nonlinear transport. The computed nonlinear Hall response in BaMnSb$_2$ is in agreement with experiments. By adding the Berry curvature to first-principles transport calculations, our work advances the quantitative analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear transport phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir√© replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir√© period in the range of 25 √Ö to 80 √Ö by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir√© periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moir√© modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moir√© effects.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</p>

            <p>We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and super-Poissonian ($F > 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.</p>

            <p>We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge States</h2>

            <p>Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly this http URL and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Magnon-mediated Radiation and Phonon-driven Quenching of Excitons in a Layered Semiconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingchen Peng, Yanan Ge, Zihan Wang, Kang Wang, Kezhao Du, Xingzhi Wang, Ye Yang</p>
            <p>Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the N√©el temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Meng, Kainan Chang, Yanyan Qian, Luxia Wang, Jin Luo Cheng</p>
            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <h2>Twist-tuned exchange and hysteresis in a bilayer van der Waals magnet</h2>

            <p>Moir√© superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3¬∞. This is observed as the corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior, attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging across the moir√© supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of antiferromagnetic order.</p>

            <h2>Exact solution for the current generated by dissipative master equation in single-band tight-binding systems subject to time-dependent uniform electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. M. Alendouro Pinho, B. Amorim, J. M. Viana Parente Lopes</p>
            <p>The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.</p>

            <h2>Finite element models for Self-Deployable Miura-folded origami</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suraj Singh Gehlot, Siddhanth Gautam, Sanhita Das</p>
            <p>Origami-inspired self-deployable structures offer lightweight, compact, and autonomous deployment capabilities, making them highly attractive for aerospace and defence applications, such as solar panels, antennas, and reflector systems. This paper presents finite element frameworks for simulating Miura-origami units in ABAQUS, focusing on two deployment mechanisms: elastic strain energy release and thermally activated shape-memory polymers (SMPs). Validation against experimental data for elastic deployment demonstrates that the model accurately captures fold trajectories and overall kinematics. Parametric studies reveal the influence of hinge stiffness and damping on deployment efficiency. SMP-based simulations qualitatively reproduce stress-strain-temperature behaviour and realistic shape recovery ratios. The study establishes that predictive numerical models can effectively guide the design of origami-based deployable structures for aerospace and defence applications, while highlighting the challenges associated with hinge modelling, damping effects, and thermomechanical actuation.</p>

            <p>Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic. Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M√∏lmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schr√∂dinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> √Ålvaro Buend√≠a, Jos√© Luis Pura, Vincenzo Giannini, Jos√© Antonio S√°nchez Gil</p>
            <p>Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis, employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode. Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.</p>

            <p>Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (<10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</p>

            <p>NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable platform for superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Imran, Sikander Azam, Qaiser Rafiq, Amin Ur Rahman</p>
            <p>Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1 eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2 eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K. These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Sardinero, Jorge Cayao, Rub√©n Seoane Souto, Pablo Burset</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled, which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>Magnetic spin topological textures recently found their electrical counterparts in polar topologies emerging from the condensation of inhomogeneous polar atomic distortions. Here, we further extend the concept to other non-polar atomic degrees of freedom. Taking SrTiO$_3$ as a prototypical example, we investigate from second-principles atomistic simulations, the equilibrium domain structures and topological textures associated with the natural antiferrodistortive rotations of its oxygen octahedra. % Besides the common 90$^\circ$ antiferrodistortive domain walls (twin boundaries), we identify new metastable 180$^\circ$ domain walls oriented along the $\lbrace100\rbrace_\mathrm{pc}$ direction, when compressive epitaxial strain is applied. These domains exhibit complex antiferrodistortive Bloch- and N√©el-like configurations with the later being the most favorable. We also stabilize antiferrodistortive vortex and antivortex structures which are accompanied by co-localized polarization vortices and a complex pattern of the local strain field, giving rise to a trimodal topological structures. Our results extends the concept of topological ordering to non-polar structural degrees of freedom and highlights the role of lattice-mediated couplings in stabilizing complex textures in perovskite oxides.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ artificial superlattices recently emerged as a prototypical platform for the emergence and study of polar topologies. While previous studies mainly focused on the polar textures inherent to the ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ layers, the oxygen octahedra rotations inherent to the paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ layers have attracted much little attention. Here, we highlight a biunivocal relationship between distinct polar topologies -- including $a_1/a_2$ domains, polar vortices, and skyrmions -- within the PbTiO$_3$ layers and specific patterns of oxygen octahedra rotations in the SrTiO$_3$ layers. This relationship arises from a strain-mediated coupling between the two materials and is shown to be reciprocal. Through second-principles atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that each polar texture imposes a corresponding rotation pattern, while conversely, a frozen oxygen octahedra rotation dictates the emergence of the associated polar state. This confirms the strong coupling between oxygen octahedra rotations in SrTiO$_3$ and polarization in PbTiO$_3$, highlighting their cooperative role in stabilizing complex polar textures in related superlattices.</p>

            <p>The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit, a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for electrically tunable spintronics.</p>

In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. J. Priour Jr</p>
            <p>Percolation in systems made up of randomly placed impermeable grains is often examined in the context of system spanning clusters of connected solids forming above a relatively low critical grain density $\rho_{c1}$ or networks of interstitial void volumes ceasing to exist above a signficantly higher threshold $\rho_{c2}$. In this work, we interpret these percolation transitions as, respectively, the low and high density boundaries of percolating exposed surfaces which either ensheath clusters of impermeable particles or line tunnel-like voids. Moreover, we find in the thermodynamic limit exposed surfaces are either sheaths or tunnels with a second order phase transition from the former to the latter at a density threshold $\rho_{c*}$ intermediate between $\rho_{c1}$ and $\rho_{c2}$. We calculate critical inclusion densities with a new method which identifies exposed free surfaces in a geometrically exact manner with a computational cost scaling only linearly in the system volume. We obtain $\rho_{c1}$, $\rho_{c2}$, and $\rho_{c*}$ for a variety of grain geometries, including each of the Platonic solids, truncated icosahedra, and structurally disordered inclusions formed from cubes subject to a random sequence of slicing planes. In the case of the latter, we find a limiting value of $5\%$ for the critical porosity at the void percolation threshold as the number of sustained slices per cube becomes large.</p>

            <h2>A nonequilibrium distribution for stochastic thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Luc Garden</p>
            <p>The canonical distribution of Gibbs is extended to the case of systems outside equilibrium. The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium process.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of individual active elastic filaments with chiral self-propulsion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanania Steinbock, Daniel A. Beller</p>
            <p>We study the over-damped dynamics of individual one-dimensional elastic filaments subjected to a chiral active force which propels each point of the filament at a fixed angle relative to the tangent vector of the filament at that point. Such a model is a reasonable starting point for describing the behavior of polymers such as microtubules in gliding assay experiments. We derive sixth-order nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the intrinsic properties of the filament, namely, its curvature and metric, and show that these equations are capable of supporting multiple different stationary solutions in a co-moving frame, i.e. that chiral active elastic filaments exhibit dynamic multi-stability in their shapes. A linear stability analysis of these solutions is carried out to determine which solutions are stable and a brief analysis of the time-dependent approach to stationary shape is considered. Finally, simulations are presented which confirm many of our predictions while also revealing additional complexity.</p>

            <h2>Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weixin Li, Rundong Yuan, Fenglin Zhong, Bo Peng, Jean-Philippe Ansermet, Haiming Yu</p>
            <p>Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.</p>

            <p>Excitons govern the light-matter interaction in 2D gapped materials with intrinsically large binding energies. In spite of plentiful optical measurements in the visible for semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, we still lack optical-absorption studies of the exciton structure of insulating 2D materials that requires UV light. Moreover, measurements of the momentum dispersion of excitons in the vicinity of optical limit are rare owing to low resolutions but hold the key to reveal quasiparticle interactions. To close this gap, we employ high momentum resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ($q$-EELS) to explore exciton dispersions of mono- and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Surprisingly, we reveal a fine structure of the first bright exciton dispersion band composed by two features (A and A$'$), visible only at small momentum, not predicted by Bethe-Salpeter calculations. Introducing an optical conductivity approximation (OCA), we extract from the experimental $q$-EELS spectra the ultraviolet (UV) optical conductivity at zero momentum, $\sigma(\omega)$, and discuss the exciton fine structure in $\sigma(\omega)$, consistent with previous photoluminescence observations. Our findings establish a general methodology to probe the fine structure of exciton dispersions, providing new insights into exciton-phonon sidebands and eventually polarons in low-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85¬∞C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.</p>

            <p>This study explores Ti-containing complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) within the AlMoNbTiZr system, focusing on compositions located in regions of the Bo-Md diagram characterized by low bond order (Bo) and d-orbital energy level (Md). Four alloys were designed near the line predicting stress-induced martensite formation in conventional Ti alloys, then cast, annealed at 1200¬∞C, and water quenched. Their microstructures and phases were analyzed and compared against phase prediction tools commonly applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs), namely empirical parameters and CALPHAD simulations. Results highlight the strong influence of chemical affinity, particularly the roles of Al, Mo, and Zr concentrations, on solid-solution stability. A maximum Al content of 10 at% was identified as the threshold for achieving a single-phase microstructure, observed in the 10Al15Mo10Nb35Ti30Zr alloy. This alloy exhibited a bcc/b2 structure with high compressive strength (above 1300 MPa), low Young's modulus (28 GPa), and limited strain (<6%), but lacked the transformation-induced strengthening mechanisms expected for Ti alloys with comparable Bo-Md values.</p>

            <p>The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.</p>

            <p>The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Wang, Ruihua Fan, Tianle Wang, Samuel J. Garratt, Ehud Altman</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</p>

            <p>We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</p>

            <p>The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2 modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.</p>

            <h2>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee</p>
            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p>From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moir√© systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Palkanoglou, Alexandros Gezerlis</p>
            <p>The gap equations lie at the core of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, a standard tool in the description of superfluidity. As a set of non-linear integral equations, the gap equations' inherent difficulties oftentimes hinder even the crudest descriptions of superfluid states. Hard-core potentials, high-density superfluids, and coupled-channel pairing are all reasons that have historically required one to provide special treatment to the gap equations to get a solution. In this paper we present a new method for solving the gap equations that holds the promise of being an efficient universal solver that requires the minimum amount of \textit{a priori} knowledge of the targeted solutions. With theoretical evidence of exotic nuclear superfluidity posing new questions to our understanding of this fundamental property of nuclear systems, the presented method can be a valuable tool when exploring new pairing states, finite-temperature properties, or the development of sophisticated descriptions of nuclear superfludity.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer R√©nyi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grace M. Sommers, J. Alexander Jacoby, Zack Weinstein, David A. Huse, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</p>

It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G<0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.</p>

            <p>In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\Gamma K$ \& $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.</p>

            <p>An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zicheng Yan (1), Jialiang Tao (2), Christian Franck (2), David L. Henann (1) ((1) Brown University, (2) University of Wisconsin-Madison)</p>
            <p>This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.</p>

One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</p>

            <h2>Balanced ternary formalism of second quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yao Yao</p>
            <p>We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepika Gill, Sangeeta Sharma, Peter Elliott, Kay Dewhurst, Sam Shallcross</p>
            <p>Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation follows according to non-Hermitian operators. As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yue Zhang, Zi-Xiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Random unitaries that conserve energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Mao, Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Kazi, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Zlokapa, Bobak T. Kiani, Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sitan Chen, Jordan Cotler, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.</p>

            <p>We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thi Ha Kyaw, Guillermo Romero, Gaurav Saxena</p>
            <p>A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Bergamaschi, Chi-Fang Chen, Umesh Vazirani</p>
            <p>Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drude-like features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning. We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.</p>

We establish that a singular perturbation underlies caustics formation by SPPs around a single vortex, and numerical studies of SPPs in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence reveal intense caustics in straining regions of the flow, peaking at intermediate levels of self-propulsion. Our work offers a route to singularly high local concentrations in a macroscopically dilute suspension of zero-Reynolds-number swimmers. Caustics generate burst-like encounters through large relative velocities between neighboring swimmers, with potentially significant implications for communication and sexual reproduction. An intriguing open direction is whether the active turbulence of a suspension of swimming microbes could serve to generate caustics in its own concentration</p>

            <p>Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</p>

            <p>Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</p>

Studies suggest a link to quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations or 'defects,' but identifying them is challenging due to hybridization with phonons that renders methods based on localization properties, such as the participation ratio, unreliable. We introduce a practical method to separate hybridized phonons from localized vibrations and find that boson peak phonons hybridize with compact, two-dimensional defects exhibiting oscillatory pure shear deformations. These two-dimensional defects are also exposed by the procedure recently employed to identify stringlets (Nature Physics volume 18, pages 669-677 (2022)), suggesting that these may not be one-dimensional objects as speculated. Our work demonstrates the presence of localized defects at the boson peak frequency and provides a comprehensive characterization of their vibrational and geometric properties, resolving the tension between the concepts of quasi-localized quadrupolar defects and stringlets.</p>

            <p>Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement and confinement: A new pairing mechanism in high-T_{C} cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix A. Buot, Roland E. S. Otadoy, Unofre Pili</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that entanglement and confinement hole pairing (ECHP) is the precise physics for the entanglement framework of the RVB theory of high-Tc cuprates. Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of spin-gap and strange-metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of over-doped regions of SC dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of SC dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement-confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we are able to give a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving the sought-after mechanism responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Direct imaging and control of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnetic single-crystal thin films</h2>

            <p>The discovery of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets where transverse Hall voltage emerges without magnetic field, has opened a plethora of promising opportunities in antiferromagnetic devices. The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the N√©el transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Deterministic control of coupled ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders remains a central challenge in multiferroics, limiting their integration into functional magnetoelectrics and magnonic-devices. (111)pc BiFeO3 with a robust single spin cycloid, offers direct magnetoelectric-coupling and a platform for efficient spin transport, yet multi-magnetic domains and ferroelectric-fatigue have prevented reproducible control. Here, we show that anisotropic-compressive in-plane strain stabilizes a single antiferromagnetic domain with unique spin-cycloid vector, by breaking the symmetry of the (111)pc plane. Epitaxial BiFeO3 films grown on orthorhombic NdGaO3 (011)o [(111)pc] substrates impose the required anisotropic in-plane strain and stabilizes single antiferromagnetic domain, as confirmed through direct imaging with scanning NV microscopy and non-resonant-x-ray-magnetic-scattering. Remarkably, these engineered films exhibit deterministic and non-volatile 180¬∞ switching of ferroelectric and single antiferromagnetic domains over 1,000 cycles. The monodomain state also enables anisotropic and threefold enhanced magnon transport with reduced scattering. Thus, symmetry-designed (111)pc monodomain BiFeO3 offers a robust platform for advanced magnetoelectric and magnonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$ and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. J. Garcia, J. G. Sereni, A. A. Aligia</p>
            <p>We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Franchini</p>
            <p>We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function by constructing a kernel representation of the Primon gas based on a finite p-base, thereby establishing a concrete link between number theory and kernel theory.</p>

            <p>According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed-melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some 2D systems. Here, we imaged silver iodide (AgI) embedded in multilayer graphene using time and temperature resolved in-situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observe the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.</p>

            <h2>The Mottness and the Anderson localization in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-Œ¥}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Wang, Ziyan Chen, Yi Zhang, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu</p>
            <p>The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and superconducting properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states. This Anderson localization transition is the key reason for the suppression of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</p>

            <p>Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.</p>

            <h2>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enderalp Yakaboylu, Thomas L. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.</p>

            <h2>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Englezos, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis</p>
            <p>The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongxin Yu, Shuozhen Zhao, Michael J. Miksis, Petia M. Vlahovska</p>
            <p>The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking into account the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Kang, Oskar Vafek</p>
            <p>Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</p>
