            <h2>Dual radar-guided glide path error correction based on the Izhikevich neuron model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gao, Xinyu Wang, Yifan Ren, Yuning Zhou, Ziwei Wang</p>
            <p>Aiming at the ranging and angle measurement errors caused by target reflection characteristics and system noise in dual radar tracking, this paper proposes a dual radar track error correction method based on the Izhikevich neural model. The network uses the dynamic differential equation of the Izhikevich model to simulate the discharge characteristics of biological neurons. Its input layer integrates the coordinate measurement data of the dual radar, and the output layer represents the error compensation amount through the pulse emission frequency. The spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is used to adjust the neuron connection weights dynamically, and the trajectory distortion caused by system noise and radar ranging and angle measurement errors can be effectively suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing the 4G--5G Migration: A Simulation-Driven Roadmap for Emerging Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Desire Guel, Justin Pegd-Windé Kouraogo, Kouka Kouakou Nakoulma</p>
            <p>Deploying fifth-generation (5G) networks in emerging markets demands a balance between performance targets and constraints in budget, spectrum, and infrastructure. We use MATLAB simulations to quantify how radio and architectural levers - MIMO (beamforming, diversity, spatial multiplexing), carrier aggregation (CA), targeted spectrum refarming to New Radio (NR), mmWave propagation with blockage/rain, and Non-Standalone (NSA) versus Standalone (SA) cores - affect capacity, coverage, latency, and interference robustness, with D2D and M2M as complements to wide-area access. Beamforming improves cell-edge SNR by about 3-6 dB, while spatial multiplexing dominates at moderate/high SNR via multi-stream gains. Throughput scales strongly with CA: increasing from 1 to 5x20-MHz carriers raises peak rate from about 200 Mb/s to about 1 Gb/s at 30 dB SNR; water-filling adds 5-12% over equal power at mid-SNR. Targeted mid-band refarming to NR increases median throughput by 60-90% in urban and 40-70% in rural scenarios when sub-1-GHz layers preserve coverage. At 28 GHz, rain and human blockage add about 8-30 dB excess loss, so viable mmWave deployment concentrates in LOS hot zones with narrow-beam arrays and short inter-site distances. NSA delivers broader initial coverage than SA by reusing LTE/EPC, while SA becomes attractive as transport improves (e.g., >= 10 Gb/s and < 5 ms RTT) and site density grows. We synthesize these results into a practical roadmap: start NR on NSA, prioritize CA-centric spectrum strategies with focused refarming, densify selectively in demand hotspots, and migrate to SA as backhaul and device ecosystems mature.</p>

            <h2>Control and Stability of a Multilevel Power System for a Future Distribution Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Wu, Jan H. van Schuppen, Hai Xiang Lin</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks poses significant challenges to frequency and voltage stability due to their intermittent nature and low-inertia dynamics. This paper proposes a multilevel control framework for a future decarbonized power system, using energy storage systems as power buffers to mitigate frequency and voltage fluctuations. A nonlinear interconnected model is formulated to characterize the complex dynamics across multiple levels of the distribution network. To reduce operational complexity and communication overhead of these dynamics, a distributed linear quadratic regulator control strategy is developed for information exchange in a bottom-up approach, where each level implements local feedback control within a short time horizon. Stability conditions for both open-loop and closed-loop systems are established using Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition, explicit performance bounds are derived to quantify the optimal difference between the proposed distributed strategy and the centralized control method, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Power-Water Coordination: Unlocking Flexibility in Hybrid RO Desalination Plants via Variable-Speed Pumps and Tank Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongxing Hu, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>Water desalination plants (DPs) are among the most critical infrastructures and largest electricity loads in water-scarce regions worldwide. Although reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is the most energy-efficient and dominant technology, it remains energy-intensive but can offer substantial flexibility potential for power systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation framework for power systems and DPs that explicitly accounts for both systems' operational constraints and fully unlocks DP flexibility. To achieve this, a detailed DP model is developed, incorporating the characteristics of an actual high-pressure pump with variable-speed operation, on-off operation with flushing requirements, water quality constraints, and water dynamics and salt mixing in the storage tank. By proactively managing freshwater storage and tank salinity in a closed-loop coordinated scheduling framework, the operational flexibility of the DP is significantly enhanced. With appropriate simplification and linearization, the resulting coordinated scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and a two-step decomposed commitment-scheduling stochastic optimization (TDCSO) is proposed to efficiently address uncertainties. Case studies validate the proposed approach and demonstrate up to a 6% operating cost reduction.</p>

            <h2>Next-Generation Grid Codes: Toward a New Paradigm for Dynamic Ancillary Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Kehao Zhuang, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Hardware-Impaired Wireless Fronthaul</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) enhances spectral and energy efficiency compared to conventional cellular networks by enabling joint transmission and reception across a large number of distributed access points (APs). Since these APs are envisioned to be low-cost and densely deployed, hardware impairments, stemming from non-ideal radio-frequency (RF) chains, are unavoidable. While existing studies primarily address hardware impairments on the access side, the impact of hardware impairments on the wireless fronthaul link has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we fill this important gap by introducing a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless fronthauling scheme tailored for cell-free massive MIMO. Focusing on the uplink, we develop an analytical framework that jointly models the hardware impairments at both the APs and the fronthaul transceivers, derives the resulting end-to-end distorted signal expression, and quantifies the individual contribution of each impairment to the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we design distortion-aware linear combiners that optimally mitigate these effects. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains from distortion-aware processing and illustrate the potential of the proposed AF fronthauling scheme as a cost-effective enabler for future cell-free architectures.</p>

            <h2>Joint Impact of ADC and Fronthaul Quantization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>In the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system, quantization affects performance in two key domains: the time-domain distortion introduced by finite-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the access points (APs), and the fronthaul quantization of signals sent to the central processing unit (CPU). Although quantizing twice may seem redundant, the ADC quantization in orthogonal frequency-division duplex (OFDM) systems appears in the time domain, and one must then convert to the frequency domain, where quantization can be applied only to the signals at active subcarriers. This reduces fronthaul load and avoids unnecessary distortion, since the ADC output spans all OFDM samples while only a subset of subcarriers carries useful information. While both quantization effects have been extensively studied in narrowband systems, their joint impact in practical wideband OFDM-based cell-free massive MIMO remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the gap by modeling the joint distortion and proposing a fronthaul strategy in which each AP processes the received signal to reduce quantization artifacts before transmission. We develop an efficient estimation algorithm that reconstructs the unquantized time-domain signal prior to fronthaul transmission and evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed design offers new insights for implementing efficient, quantization-aware uplink transmission in wideband cell-free architectures.</p>

            <h2>Coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Control of Point Absorbers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhan, Iván Martínez-Estévez, Min Luo, Alejandro J.C. Crespo, Abbas Khayyer</p>
            <p>Wave Energy Converters, particularly point absorbers, have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for harvesting ocean wave energy. Nevertheless, achieving high conversion efficiency remains challenging due to the inherently complex and nonlinear interactions between incident waves and device motion dynamics. This study develops an optimal adaptive damping control model for the power take-off (PTO) system by coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables real-time communication between high-fidelity SPH simulations and intelligent control agents that learn coordinated policies to maximise energy capture. In each training episode, the SPH-based environment provides instantaneous hydrodynamic states to the agents, which output continuous damping actions and receive rewards reflecting power absorption. The Multi-Agent Soft Actor Critic algorithm is employed within a centralised-training and decentralised-execution scheme to ensure stable learning in continuous, multi-body systems. The entire platform is implemented in a unified GPU-accelerated C++ environment, allowing long-horizon training and large-scale three-dimensional simulations. The approach is validated through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark cases under regular and irregular wave conditions. Compared with constant PTO damping, the learned control policy increases overall energy capture by 23.8% and 21.5%, respectively, demonstrating the strong potential of intelligent control for improving the performance of wave energy converter arrays. The developed three-dimensional GPU-accelerated multi-agent platform in computational hydrodynamics, is extendable to other fluid-structure interaction engineering problem that require real-time, multi-body coordinated control.</p>

            <h2>Artificial Intelligence Driven Channel Coding and Resource Optimization for Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasir Ali, Tayyab Manzoor, Huan Yang, Chenhang Yan, Yuanqing Xia</p>
            <p>The ongoing evolution of 5G and its enhanced version, 5G+, has significantly transformed the telecommunications landscape, driving an unprecedented demand for ultra-high-speed data transmission, ultra-low latency, and resilient connectivity. These capabilities are essential for enabling mission-critical applications such as the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and smart city infrastructures. This paper investigates the important role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing the key challenges faced by 5G/5G+ networks, including interference mitigation, dynamic resource allocation, and maintaining seamless network operation. The study particularly focuses on AI-driven innovations in coding theory, which offer advanced solutions to the limitations of conventional error correction and modulation techniques. By employing deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neural network-based approaches, this research demonstrates significant advancements in error correction performance, decoding efficiency, and adaptive transmission strategies. Additionally, the integration of AI with emerging technologies, such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output, intelligent reflecting surfaces, and privacy-enhancing mechanisms, is discussed, highlighting their potential to propel the next generation of wireless networks. This paper also provides insights into the transformative impact of AI on modern wireless communication, establishing a foundation for scalable, adaptive, and more efficient network architectures.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis for Wireless Localization with Random Sensor Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengqi Ma, Aihua Xia</p>
            <p>Accurate wireless localization underpins applications from autonomous systems to smart infrastructure. We study the mean-squared error (MSE) and conditional MSE (CMSE) of a practical fusion-based estimator in d-dimensional, stationary isotropic (translation- and rotation-invariant) random sensor networks, where a central processor combines received-signal-strength (RSS) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements to infer a target's position. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish an approximation theorem: when measurement noise is sufficiently large, the joint law of RSS and AOA observations under a broad class of stationary isotropic deployments is, in distribution, indistinguishable from that induced by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Second, leveraging this equivalence, we investigate a homogeneous PPP-based sensor network. We propose a fusion-based estimator in which a central processor aggregates RSS and AOA measurements from a set of spatially distributed sensors to infer the target position. For this PPP deployment within a finite observation region, we derive tractable analytical upper bounds for both the MSE and CMSE, establishing explicit scaling laws with respect to sensor density, observation radius, and noise variance. The approximation theorem then certifies these PPP-based bounds as reasonable proxies for non-Poisson deployments in noisy regimes. Overall, the results translate deployment and sensing parameters into achievable accuracy targets and provide robust, cost-aware guidance for the design of next-generation location-aware wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Building Envelope Inversion by Data-driven Interpretation of Ground Penetrating Radar</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Nirjhar Alam, Wesley Reinhart, Rebecca Napolitano</p>
            <p>Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) combines depth resolution, non-destructive operation, and broad material sensitivity, yet it has seen limited use in diagnosing building envelopes. The compact geometry of wall assemblies, where reflections from closely spaced studs, sheathing, and cladding strongly overlap, has made systematic inversion difficult. Recent advances in data-driven interpretation provide an opportunity to revisit this challenge and assess whether machine learning can reliably extract structural information from such complex signals. Here, we develop a GPR-based inversion framework that decomposes wall diagnostics into classification tasks addressing vertical (stud presence) and lateral (wall-type) variations. Alongside model development, we implement multiple feature minimization strategies - including recursive elimination, agglomerative clustering, and L0-based sparsity - to promote fidelity and interpretability. Among these approaches, the L0-based sparse neural network (SparseNN) emerges as particularly effective: it exceeds Random Forest accuracy while relying on only a fraction of the input features, each linked to identifiable dielectric interfaces. SHAP analysis further confirms that the SparseNN learns reflection patterns consistent with physical layer boundaries. In summary, this framework establishes a foundation for physically interpretable and data-efficient inversion of wall assemblies using GPR radargrams. Although defect detection is not addressed here, the ability to reconstruct intact envelope structure and isolate features tied to key elements provides a necessary baseline for future inversion and anomaly-analysis tasks.</p>

            <h2>A Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling and Sensor/Actuator Placement Framework for Flexible Spacecraft</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Hilsenrath, Daniel R. Herber</p>
            <p>Flexible spacecraft structures present significant challenges for physical and control system design due to nonlinear dynamics, mission constraints, environmental variables, and changing operational conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for constructing reduced-order surrogate models of a flexible spacecraft using the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), followed by optimal sensor/actuator pair placement. Highfidelity simulation data from a nonlinear flexible spacecraft model, including coupled rigid-body and elastic modes, are captured by defining a mesh of nodes over the spacecraft body. The data-driven methods are then used to construct a modal model from the time histories of these node points. Optimal sensor/actuator placement for controllability and observability is performed via a nonlinear programming technique that maximizes the singular values of the Hankel matrix. Finally, the sensor placement and dynamics modeling approach is iterated to account for changes in the dynamic system introduced by sensor/actuator physical mass. The proposed methodology enables initialization of physical modeling without requiring a direct analytical model and provides a practical solution for onboard implementation in model-based control and estimation systems. Results demonstrate optimal design methodology with substantial model-order reduction while preserving dynamic fidelity, and provide insight into effective sensor-actuator configurations for estimation and control.</p>

            <h2>Koopman Model Dimension Reduction via Variational Bayesian Inference and Graph Search</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Selin Ezgi Ozcan, Mustafa Mert Ankarali</p>
            <p>Koopman operator recently gained increasing attention in the control systems community for its abilities to bridge linear and nonlinear systems. Data driven Koopman operator approximations have established themselves as key enablers for system identification and model predictive control. Nonetheless, such methods commonly entail a preselected definition of states in the function space leading to high dimensional overfitting models and degraded long term prediction performances. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical probabilistic approach for the Koopman model identification problem. In our method, elements of the model are treated as random variables and the posterior estimates are found using variational Bayesian (VB) inference updates. Our model distinguishes from others in the integration of inclusion flags. By the help of the inclusion flags, we intuitively threshold the probability of each state in the model. We then propose a graph search based algorithm to reduce the preselected states of the Koopman model. We demonstrate that our reduction method overcomes numerical instabilities and the reduced models maintain performance in simulated and real experiments.</p>

            <h2>Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Darvishi</p>
            <p>Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA in Block-Based Image Compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yashika Ahlawat</p>
            <p>Block based image compression relies on transform coding to concentrate signal energy into a small number of coefficients. While classical codecs use fixed transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), data driven methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are theoretically optimal for decorrelation. This paper presents an experimental comparison of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA across multiple block sizes and compression rates. Using rate distortion and energy compaction analysis, we show that PCA outperforms fixed transforms only when block dimensionality is sufficiently large, while DCT remains near optimal for standard block sizes such as $8\times8$ and at low bit rates. These results explain the robustness of DCT in practical codecs and highlight the limitations of block wise learned transforms.</p>

            <p>Embedded vision systems need efficient and robust image processing algorithms to perform real-time, with resource-constrained hardware. This research investigates image processing algorithms, specifically edge detection, corner detection, and blob detection, that are implemented on embedded processors, including DSPs and FPGAs. To address latency, accuracy and power consumption noted in the image processing literature, optimized algorithm architectures and quantization techniques are employed. In addition, optimal techniques for inter-frame redundancy removal and adaptive frame averaging are used to improve throughput with reasonable image quality. Simulations and hardware trials of the proposed approaches show marked improvements in the speed and energy efficiency of processing as compared to conventional implementations. The advances of this research facilitate a path for scalable and inexpensive embedded imaging systems for the automotive, surveillance, and robotics sectors, and underscore the benefit of co-designing algorithms and hardware architectures for practical real-time embedded vision applications.</p>

            <h2>FastSLM: Hierarchical Frame Q-Former for Effective Speech Modality Adaptation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junseok Lee, Sangyong Lee, Chang-Jae Chun</p>
            <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-expert-level capabilities, driving significant interest in their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In particular, there is growing momentum in adapting LLMs to various modalities, including vision, video, and speech, through the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, existing speech-language model (SLM) research has largely overlooked cost-effective adaptation strategies for leveraging LLMs in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

            <h2>Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Video Transmission with Asymmetric Context</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuechen Chen, Junting Li, Chuang Chen, Hairong Lin, Yishen Li</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a high-efficiency deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for video transmission based on conditional coding with asymmetric context. The conditional coding-based neural video compression requires to predict the encoding and decoding conditions from the same context which includes the same reconstructed frames. However in JSCC schemes which fall into pseudo-analog transmission, the encoder cannot infer the same reconstructed frames as the decoder even a pipeline of the simulated transmission is constructed at the encoder. In the proposed method, without such a pipeline, we guide and design neural networks to learn encoding and decoding conditions from asymmetric contexts. Additionally, we introduce feature propagation, which allows intermediate features to be independently propagated at the encoder and decoder and help to generate conditions, enabling the framework to greatly leverage temporal correlation while mitigating the problem of error accumulation. To further exploit the performance of the proposed transmission framework, we implement content-adaptive coding which achieves variable bandwidth transmission using entropy models and masking mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep video transmission frameworks in terms of performance and effectively mitigates the error accumulation. By mitigating the error accumulation, our schemes can reduce the frequency of inserting intra-frame coding modes, further enhancing performance.</p>

            <h2>Auditory Filter Behavior and Updated Estimated Constants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samiya A Alkhairy</p>
            <p>Filters from the Gammatone family are often used to model auditory signal processing, but the filter constant values used to mimic human hearing are largely set to values based on historical psychoacoustic data collected several decades ago. Here, we move away from this long-standing convention, and estimate filter constants using a range of more recent reported filter characteristics (such as quality factors and ratios between quality factors and peak group delay) within a characteristics-based framework that clarifies how filter behavior is related to the underlying constants. Using a sharp-filter approximation that captures shared peak-region behavior across certain classes of filters, we analyze the range of behaviors accessible when the full degrees of freedom of the filter are utilized rather than fixing the filter order or exponent to historically prescribed values. Filter behavior is characterized using magnitude-based and phase-based characteristics and their ratios, which reveal which characteristics are informative for constraining filter constants and which are only weakly constraining. We show that these insights and estimation methods extend to multiple realizable filter classes from the Gammatone family and apply them, together with recent physiological and psychoacoustic observations, to derive constraints on and estimates for filter constants for human auditory filters. More broadly, this framework supports the design of auditory filters with arbitrary characteristic-level specifications and enables systematic assessment of how variations in filter characteristics influence auditory models, perceptual findings, and technologies that rely on auditory filterbanks.</p>

            <h2>TagSpeech: End-to-End Multi-Speaker ASR and Diarization with Fine-Grained Temporal Grounding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyue Huo, Yiwen Shao, Yuheng Zhang</p>
            <p>We present TagSpeech, a unified LLM-based framework that utilizes Temporal Anchor Grounding for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization. The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Hardware-in-the-loop wind-tunnel testing of wake interactions between two floating wind turbines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Fontanella, Kristjan Milic, Alan Facchinetti, Sara Muggiasca, Marco Belloli</p>
            <p>Wake interactions in floating wind farms are inherently coupled to platform motion, yet most experimental studies to date neglect this two-way coupling by prescribing platform movements. This work presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind-tunnel methodology to investigate wake interactions between two floating wind turbines with fully coupled aerodynamic loading and platform dynamics. The approach integrates physical wind-tunnel testing of two scaled rotors with a real-time numerical model that accounts for platform motion, mooring restoring forces, and hydrodynamic loads. Experiments conducted under low-turbulence inflow conditions show that a downstream turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine experiences reduced mean thrust and platform deflections due to the decreased inflow velocity, alongside enhanced low-frequency platform motions driven by increased turbulent energy in the wake. The proposed HIL framework provides a controlled experimental basis for studying wake-induced excitation mechanisms and supports the validation of floating wind farm models and control strategies.</p>

            <p>Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.</p>

            <h2>DIVINE: Coordinating Multimodal Disentangled Representations for Oro-Facial Neurological Disorder Assessment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Muskaan Singh</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a multimodal framework for predicting neuro-facial disorders by capturing both vocal and facial cues. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio- only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Attribution and Open-Set Detection using Graph-Augmented Instance Learning in Synthetic Speech</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Farhan Sheth, Muskaan Singh</p>
            <p>We propose a unified framework for not only attributing synthetic speech to its source but also for detecting speech generated by synthesizers that were not encountered during training. This requires methods that move beyond simple detection to support both detailed forensic analysis and open-set generalization. To address this, we introduce SIGNAL, a hybrid framework that combines speech foundation models (SFMs) with graph-based modeling and open-set-aware inference. Our framework integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, allowing it to capture meaningful relationships between utterances and recognize speech that doesn`t belong to any known generator. It constructs a query-conditioned graph over generator class prototypes, enabling the GNN to reason over relationships among candidate generators, while the KNN branch supports open-set detection via confidence-based thresholding. We evaluate SIGNAL using the DiffSSD dataset, which offers a diverse mix of real speech and synthetic audio from both open-source and commercial diffusion-based TTS systems. To further assess generalization, we also test on the SingFake benchmark. Our results show that SIGNAL consistently improves performance across both tasks, with Mamba-based embeddings delivering especially strong results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to unify graph-based learning and open-set detection for tracing synthetic speech back to its origin.</p>

            <h2>Autofocus Method for Human-Body Imaging under Respiratory Motion Using Synthetic Aperture Radar</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaya Kato, Takuya Sakamoto</p>
            <p>This study presents an effective autofocusing approach for synthetic aperture radar imaging of the human body under conditions of respiratory motion. The proposed method suppresses respiratory-motion-induced phase errors by separating radar echoes in the spatial- and time-frequency domains and estimating phase errors individually for each separated echo. By compensating for the estimated phase errors, synthetic aperture radar images focused on all scattering points are generated, even when multiple body parts exhibit different motions due to respiration. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments with four participants in the supine position. Compared with a conventional method, the proposed approach improves image quality by a factor of 5.1 in terms of Muller-Buffington sharpness, and reduces the root-mean-square error with respect to a reference point cloud from 34 mm to 20 mm.</p>

            <h2>Digital Twin for Ultra-Reliable & Low-Latency 6G Wireless Communications in Dense Urban City</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
            <p>High-frequency deployments in dense cities are difficult to plan because coverage, interference, and service reliability depend sensitively on local morphology. This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Aware LoRaWAN Gateway Placement in Dense Urban Cities Using Digital Twins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
            <p>LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required.</p>

            <p>This paper deals with analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant control and attack-resilient of cyber-physical control systems. In our recent work, it has been observed that an attack detector driven by an input residual signal is capable of reliably detecting attacks. In particular, observing system dynamics from the perspective of the system input-output signal space reveals that attacks and system uncertainties act on different system subspaces. These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection. The unified framework is proposed to handle control and detection issues uniformly and in subspaces of system input-output data. Its mathematical and control-theoretic basis is system coprime factorizations with Bezout identity at its core. We firstly explore those methods and schemes of the unified framework, which serve as the major control-theoretic tool in our work. It is followed by re-visiting and examining established attack detection and resilient control schemes. The major part of our work is the endeavours to develop a control-theoretic paradigm, in which analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant and attack-resilient control of cyber-physical control systems are addressed in a unified manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mouaad Boughellaba, Abdelhamid Tayebi, James R. Forbes, Soulaimane Berkane</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the problem of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for rigid body systems evolving in three-dimensional space. We introduce a novel matrix Lie group structure, denoted SE_{3+n}(3), that unifies the pose, gravity, linear velocity, and landmark positions within a consistent geometric framework tailored to the VIO problem. Building upon this formulation, we design an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that tightly integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual sensors. Unlike conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimators that rely on local linearization and thus ensure only local convergence, the proposed observer achieves almost global stability through the decoupling of the rotational and translational dynamics. A globally exponentially stable Riccati-based translational observer along with an almost global input-to-state stable attitude observer are designed such that the overall cascaded observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability. This cascaded architecture guarantees robust and consistent estimation of the extended state, including orientation, position, velocity, gravity, and landmark positions, up to the VIO unobservable directions (i.e., a global translation and rotation about gravity). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations as well as experimental validation on the EuRoC MAV dataset, highlighting its robustness and suitability for real-world VIO applications.</p>

            <p>Computed Laminography (CL) is a key non-destructive testing technology for the visualization of internal structures in large planar objects. The inherent scanning geometry of CL inevitably results in inter-layer aliasing artifacts, limiting its practical application, particularly in electronic component inspection. While deep learning (DL) provides a powerful paradigm for artifact removal, its effectiveness is often limited by the domain gap between synthetic data and real-world data. In this work, we present LaminoDiff, a framework to integrate a diffusion model with a high-fidelity prior representation to bridge the domain gap in CL imaging. This prior, generated via a dual-modal CT-CL fusion strategy, is integrated into the proposed network as a conditional constraint. This integration ensures high-precision preservation of circuit structures and geometric fidelity while suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real PCB datasets demonstrate that LaminoDiff achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with competitive performance in artifact suppression and detail recovery. More importantly, the results facilitate reliable automated defect recognition.</p>

            <p>We investigate antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The objective is to enhance the output direct current (DC) power under RF combining and DC combining schemes by jointly exploiting gains from antenna coding, beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity. We first propose the MIMO WPT system model with binary and continuous antenna coding using the beamspace channel model and formulate the joint antenna coding and beamforming optimization using a nonlinear rectenna model. We propose two efficient closed-form successive convex approximation algorithms to efficiently optimize the beamforming. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose codebook-based antenna coding designs for output DC power maximization based on K-means clustering. Results show that the proposed pixel antenna empowered MIMO WPT system with binary antenna coding increases output DC power by more than 15 dB compared with conventional systems with fixed antenna configuration. With continuous antenna coding, the performance improves another 6 dB. Moreover, the proposed codebook design outperforms previous designs by up to 40% and shows good performance with reduced computational complexity. Overall, the significant improvement in output DC power verifies the potential of leveraging antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas to enhance WPT systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera, Barbara Nicolas, Bruno Gilles, Adrian Basarab, Denis Kouamé</p>
            <p>Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.</p>

            <h2>Directional reflection modeling via wavenumber-domain reflection coefficient for 3D acoustic field simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoshi Hoshika, Takahiro Iwami, Akira Omoto</p>
            <p>This study proposes a framework for incorporating wavenumber-domain acoustic reflection coefficients into sound field analysis to characterize direction-dependent material reflection and scattering phenomena. The reflection coefficient is defined as the amplitude ratio between incident and reflected waves for each propagation direction and is estimated from spatial Fourier transforms of the incident and reflected sound fields. The resulting wavenumber-domain reflection coefficients are converted into an acoustic admittance representation that is directly compatible with numerical methods such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM), enabling simulation of reflections beyond simple specular components. Unlike conventional extended reaction models, the proposed approach avoids explicit modeling of the material interior. This significantly reduces computational cost while allowing direct use of measured data, empirical models, or user-defined directional reflection characteristics. The validity of the proposed formulation was previously demonstrated by the authors through two-dimensional sound field simulations, in which accurate reproduction of direction-dependent reflection behavior was confirmed. In the present work, the framework is extended to three-dimensional analysis, demonstrating its applicability to more realistic and complex acoustic environments. The proposed approach provides a practical and flexible tool for simulating direction-dependent acoustic reflections and scattering, with potential applications in architectural acoustics, material characterization, and noise control.</p>

            <p>Fully convolutional networks have become the backbone of modern medical imaging due to their ability to learn multi-scale representations and perform end-to-end inference. Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.</p>

            <p>Electric vehicles with multiple motors provide a flexibility in meeting the driver torque demand, which calls for minimizing the battery energy consumption through torque allocation. In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhang Ma, Nan Ma, Jianqiao Chen, Wenkai Liu</p>
            <p>Efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for 6G extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate channel interference. However, the massive antenna scale imposes a severe burden on feedback overhead. Meanwhile, existing quantized feedback methods face dual challenges of limited quantization precision and insufficient channel robustness when compressing high-dimensional channel features into discrete symbols. To reduce these gaps, guided by the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) framework, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-aided scheme for CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems considering the near-field effect, named VQ-DJSCC-F. Firstly, taking advantage of the sparsity of near-field channels in the polar-delay domain, we extract energy-concentrated features to reduce dimensionality. Then, we simultaneously design the Transformer and CNN (convolutional neural network) architectures as the backbones to hierarchically extract CSI features, followed by VQ modules projecting features into a discrete latent space. The entropy loss regularization in synergy with an exponential moving average (EMA) update strategy is introduced to maximize quantization precision. Furthermore, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to mitigate the impact of wireless channel fading on the transmission of index sequences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior CSI reconstruction accuracy with lower feedback overheads under varying channel conditions.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the parameter estimation in a bandwidth-constrained sensor network communicating through an insecure medium. The sensor performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an estimation center through a wireless medium where the transmission of information is vulnerable to attackers. Both eavesdroppers and data tampering attackers are considered in our setting. A differential privacy method is used to protect the sensitive information against eavesdroppers. Then, a recursive projection algorithm is proposed such that the estimation center achieves the almost sure convergence and mean-square convergence when quantized measurements, differential privacy, and data tampering attacks are considered in a uniform framework. A privacy analysis including the convergence rate with privacy or without privacy is given. Further, we extend the problem to multi-agent systems. For this case, a distributed recursive projection algorithm is proposed with guaranteed almost sure and mean square convergence. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

            <p>Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.</p>

            <p>We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Safe Navigation under Uncertain Obstacle Dynamics using Control Barrier Functions and Constrained Convex Generators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Matias, Daniel Silvestre</p>
            <p>This paper presents a sampled-data framework for the safe navigation of controlled agents in environments cluttered with obstacles governed by uncertain linear dynamics. Collision-free motion is achieved by combining Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety filtering with set-valued state estimation using Constrained Convex Generators (CCGs). At each sampling time, a CCG estimate of each obstacle is obtained using a finite-horizon guaranteed estimation scheme and propagated over the sampling interval to obtain a CCG-valued flow that describes the estimated obstacle evolution. However, since CCGs are defined indirectly - as an affine transformation of a generator set subject to equality constraints, rather than as a sublevel set of a scalar function - converting the estimated obstacle flows into CBFs is a nontrivial task. One of the main contributions of this paper is a procedure to perform this conversion, ultimately yielding a CBF via a convex optimization problem whose validity is established by the Implicit Function Theorem. The resulting obstacle-specific CBFs are then merged into a single CBF that is used to design a safe controller through the standard Quadratic Program (QP)-based approach. Since CCGs support Minkowski sums, the proposed framework also naturally handles rigid-body agents and generalizes existing CBF-based rigid-body navigation designs to arbitrary agent and obstacle geometries. While the main contribution is general, the paper primarily focuses on agents with first-order control-affine dynamics and second-order strict-feedback dynamics. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Tensor Decompositions for Online Grid-Based Terrain-Aided Navigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Matoušek, J. Krejčí, J. Duník, R. Zanetti</p>
            <p>This paper presents a practical and scalable grid-based state estimation method for high-dimensional models with invertible linear dynamics and with highly non-linear measurements, such as the nearly constant velocity model with measurements of e.g. altitude, bearing, and/or range. Unlike previous tensor decomposition-based approaches, which have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, the proposed method delivers an efficient and practical solution by exploiting decomposable model structure-specifically, block-diagonal dynamics and sparsely coupled measurement dimensions. The algorithm integrates a Lagrangian formulation for the time update and leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to compactly represent and effectively propagate state densities. This enables real-time estimation for models with large state dimension, significantly extending the practical reach of grid-based filters beyond their traditional low-dimensional use. Although demonstrated in the context of terrain-aided navigation, the method is applicable to a wide range of models with decomposable structure. The computational complexity and estimation accuracy depend on the specific structure of the model. All experiments are fully reproducible, with source code provided alongside this paper (GitHub link: this https URL).</p>

            <h2>Predefined-time One-Shot Cooperative Estimation, Guidance, and Control for Simultaneous Target Interception</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha</p>
            <p>This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.</p>

            <h2>Affordable Data Collection System for UAVs Taxi Vibration Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chaoyi Lin Yang, Gabriele Dessena, Oscar E. Bonilla-Manrique</p>
            <p>Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.</p>

            <p>Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</p>

            <p>The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</p>

            <h2>AzeroS: Extending LLM to Speech with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwen Shao, Wei Liu, Jiahong Li, Tianzi Wang, Kun Wei, Meng Yu, Dong Yu</p>
            <p>Extending large language models (LLMs) to the speech domain has recently gained significant attention. A typical approach connects a pretrained LLM with an audio encoder through a projection module and trains the resulting model on large-scale, task-specific instruction-tuning datasets. However, curating such instruction-tuning data for specific requirements is time-consuming, and models trained in this manner often generalize poorly to unseen tasks. In this work, we first formulate that the strongest generalization of a speech-LLM is achieved when it is trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT), in which supervision signals are generated by a frozen LLM using textual representations of speech as input. Our proposed SIFT paradigm eliminates the need for collecting task-specific question-answer pairs and yields the theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce AZeroS (Auden Zero-instruction-tuned Speech-LLM), which is trained on speech-text pairs derived from publicly available corpora, including approximately 25,000 hours of speech with ASR transcripts and 3,000 hours of speech with paralinguistic labels. Built upon Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the model updates only two lightweight projection modules (23.8 million parameters each), while keeping both the LLM and audio encoders frozen. Despite the minimal training cost and modest data scale, AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks, including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Yangxuan Zhou, Yiming Kang, Shijian Li, Gang Pan</p>
            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.</p>

            <p>We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruotong Zhao, Shaokang Hu, Deepak Mishra, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.</p>

Key advancements are the complex positioning system that combines 2D localization using a single motion tracking camera with onboard LiDAR for precise positioning, and a novel flight control algorithm, which works differently along the trajectory and normally to it, ensuring smoothness and high precision of the drawings at the same time. A 100 square meters mural was created using the developed multi-drone system, validating the system's efficacy. Compared to single-drone approaches, our multi-UAV solution significantly improves scalability and operational speed while maintaining high stability even in harsh weather conditions.

While my custom "MaxCRNN" (Inception + Bi-LSTM + Attention) achieved the highest safety (99% Precision) and robustness, I identify Random Forest (74% accuracy) as the Pareto-optimal solution for embedded control on legacy microcontrollers. I demonstrate that reliable, low-latency EMG control is feasible on commodity hardware, with Deep Learning offering a path to near-perfect reliability on modern Edge AI accelerators.</p>

Driving the PA with a significant input power back-off reduces nonlinear effects but is neither power-efficient nor cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, this letter augments the conventional signal generation system applied in QCs by digital predistortion (DPD) to linearize the radio frequency (RF) channel. Numerical analysis of the qubit behavior based on measured representative control signals indicates that DPD improves its fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wataru Uemura, Shogo Kawasaki</p>
            <p>A method of information transmission using visual markers has been widely studied. In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ran Tao, Jifang Qiu, Zhimeng Liu, Hongxiang Guo, Yan Li, Jian Wu</p>
            <p>Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) offer a versatile platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a generic hardware mesh. However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems.</p>

            <p>The detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs) remains a crucial challenge due to their stealthy, multistage nature and the limited availability of realistic, labeled datasets for systematic evaluation. Synthetic dataset generation has emerged as a practical approach for modeling APT campaigns; however, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive alert correlation mechanisms that limit scalability. Motivated by these limitations, this paper presents a near realistic synthetic APT dataset and an efficient alert correlation framework. The proposed approach introduces a machine learning based correlation module that employs K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering with a cosine similarity metric to group semantically related alerts within a temporal context. The dataset emulates multistage APT campaigns across campus and organizational network environments and captures a diverse set of fourteen distinct alert types, exceeding the coverage of commonly used synthetic APT datasets. In addition, explicit APT campaign states and alert to stage mappings are defined to enable flexible integration of new alert types and support stage aware analysis. A comprehensive statistical characterization of the dataset is provided to facilitate reproducibility and support APT stage predictions.</p>

            <p>Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.</p>

            <p>Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Sidorov, Ofer Hadar</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.</p>

            <h2>Large Artificial Intelligence Models for Future Wireless Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chong Huang, Gaojie Chen, Pei Xiao, Zhu Han, Rahim Tafazolli</p>
            <p>The anticipated integration of large artificial intelligence (AI) models with wireless communications is estimated to usher a transformative wave in the forthcoming information age. As wireless networks grow in complexity, the traditional methodologies employed for optimization and management face increasingly challenges. Large AI models have extensive parameter spaces and enhanced learning capabilities and can offer innovative solutions to these challenges. They are also capable of learning, adapting and optimizing in real-time. We introduce the potential and challenges of integrating large AI models into wireless communications, highlighting existing AIdriven applications and inherent challenges for future large AI models. In this paper, we propose the architecture of large AI models for future wireless communications, introduce their advantages in data analysis, resource allocation and real-time adaptation, discuss the potential challenges and corresponding solutions of energy, architecture design, privacy, security, ethical and regulatory. In addition, we explore the potential future directions of large AI models in wireless communications, laying the groundwork for forthcoming research in this area.</p>

            <h2>Directional Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control Based on a Convolutional Neural Network in Reverberant Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxiang Wang, Zhengding Luo, Haowen Li, Dongyuan Shi, Junwei Ji, Ziyi Yang, Woon-Seng Gan</p>
            <p>Selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) is a novel approach capable of mitigating noise with varying frequency characteristics. It offers faster response and greater computational efficiency compared to traditional adaptive algorithms. However, spatial factors, particularly the influence of the noise source location, are often overlooked. Some existing studies have explored the impact of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the noise source on ANC performance, but they are mostly limited to free-field conditions and do not consider the more complex indoor reverberant environments. To address this gap, this paper proposes a learning-based directional SFANC method that incorporates the DoA of the noise source in reverberant environments. In this framework, multiple reference signals are processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the azimuth and elevation angles of the noise source, as well as to identify the most appropriate control filter for effective noise cancellation. Compared to traditional adaptive algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior noise reduction with shorter response times, even in the presence of reverberations.</p>

            <h2>Neuromorphic FPGA Design for Digital Signal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin London</p>
            <p>In this paper, the foundations of neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks (SNNs) and memristors, are analyzed and discussed. Neuromorphic computing is then applied to FPGA design for digital signal processing (DSP). Finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are implemented with and without neuromorphic computing in Vivado using Verilog HDL. The results suggest that neuromorphic computing can provide low-latency and synaptic plasticity thereby enabling continuous on-chip learning. Due to their parallel and event-driven nature, neuromorphic computing can reduce power consumption by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and improve efficiency, but at the cost of reduced numeric precision.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Robust Control for Uncertain Systems with Ellipsoid-Set Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuehui Ma, Shiliang Zhang, Zhiyong Sun, Xiaohui Zhang, Sabita Maharjan</p>
            <p>Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehran Moghadam, Sercan Aygun, M.Hassan Najafi</p>
            <p>The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Compatible Dictionary Learning via Doubly Sparse Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angshul Majumdar</p>
            <p>Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at this https URL. The goal is not to claim exponential speedups, but to realign dictionary learning with the realities of near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhartha Ganguly, Kenji Kashima</p>
            <p>This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

            <p>Smart contract technology facilitates self-executing agreements on the blockchain, eliminating dependency on an external trusted authority. However, smart contracts may expose vulnerabilities that can lead to financial losses and disruptions in decentralized applications. In this work, we evaluate deep learning-based approaches for vulnerability scanning of Ethereum smart contracts. We propose VASCOT, a Vulnerability Analyzer for Smart COntracts using Transformers, which performs sequential analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and incorporates a sliding window mechanism to overcome input length constraints. To assess VASCOT's detection efficacy, we construct a dataset of 16,469 verified Ethereum contracts deployed in 2022, and annotate it using trace analysis with concrete validation to mitigate false positives. VASCOT's performance is then compared against a state-of-the-art LSTM-based vulnerability detection model on both our dataset and an older public dataset. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, providing insights into their detection capabilities and generalizability.</p>

We then use these conditions to build weak nonquadratic Lyapunov functions establishing global asymptotic stability of linear systems in feedback through a saturation, leveraging invariance principles. Our results are shown to be non-conservative (necessary and sufficient) for a family of well known prototypical examples of linear SISO feedbacks that are not globally exponentially stabilizable (the so-called ANCBI plants). Our multi-input extension leads to convex stability analysis tests, formulated as linear matrix inequalities that are applicable to ANCBI non-globally-exponentially-stabilizable plants.</p>

            <p>Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emiel Vanspranghels, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Sofie Pollin</p>
            <p>FR3 ($\approx$7-24 GHz), also referred to as the upper mid-band, has recently emerged as promising spectrum for 6G; however, its propagation and MIMO characteristics vary significantly with frequency and environment, and spectrum availability may be intermittent due to incumbents. Using site-specific ray tracing (Sionna RT) in representative indoor and outdoor scenarios, we evaluate 7, 10, 14, 20, and 24 GHz under SISO and MIMO configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Land-then-transport: A Flow Matching-Based Generative Decoder for Wireless Image Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingwen Fu, Ming Xiao, Mikael Skoglund, Dong In Kim</p>
            <p>Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.</p>

            <h2>Clipped Affine Policy: Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Online Power Control for Energy Harvesting Communications over Fading Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Wu, Shengtian Yang, Huiguo Gao, Diao Wang, Jun Chen, Guanding Yu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</p>

            <h2>Enforcing Priority in Schedule-based User Equilibrium Transit Assignment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyang Feng, Hanlin Sun, Yu Marco Nie, Jun Xie, Jiayang Li</p>
            <p>Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of verifying the finite-time safety of continuous-time perturbed deterministic systems represented by ordinary differential equations in the presence of measurable disturbances. Given a finite-time horizon, if the system is safe, it, starting from a compact initial set, will remain within an open and bounded safe region throughout the specified time horizon, regardless of the disturbances. The main contribution of this work is a converse theorem: we prove that a continuously differentiable, time-dependent barrier certificate exists if and only if the system is safe over the finite-time horizon. The existence problem is explored by finding a continuously differentiable approximation of a unique Lipschitz viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</p>

            <p>When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</p>

            <p>This paper presents our submission to the Iranian division of the Text-Dependent Speaker Verification Challenge (TdSV) 2024. Conventional TdSV approaches typically jointly model speaker and linguistic features, requiring unsegmented inputs during training and incurring high computational costs. Additionally, these methods often fine-tune large-scale pre-trained speaker embedding models on the target domain dataset, which may compromise the pre-trained models' original ability to capture speaker-specific characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we employ a TdSV system that utilizes two pre-trained models independently and demonstrate that, by leveraging pre-trained models with targeted domain adaptation, competitive results can be achieved while avoiding the substantial computational costs associated with joint fine-tuning on unsegmented inputs in conventional approaches. Our best system reached a MinDCF of 0.0358 on the evaluation subset and secured first place in the challenge.</p>

            <p>Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings show that both the STN motor subdivision and STN motor streamlines are consistently engaged under clinical settings, while regions of avoidance receive minimal stimulation. Given these findings, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing anatomical constraints is demonstrated at the example of ten Parkinson's disease patients. The predicted settings were generally found to achieve higher target coverages while providing a better trade-off between maximizing target coverage and minimizing stimulation of regions associated with side effects. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</p>

However, conventional digital processors face limitations in scalability, cost, and power consumption that hinder this vision.

            <p>This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</p>

            <h2>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee</p>
            <p>Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. This adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.</p>

Furthermore, UPM accelerates acquisition by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to localization microscopy.

We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</p>

            <h2>Generative Diffusion Receivers: Achieving Pilot-Efficient MIMO-OFDM Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhi Yang, Omar Alhussein, Atefeh Arani, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference, achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems, generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models, we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.</p>

            <h2>Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruolin Du, Zhiqiang Wei, Zai Yang, Lei Yang, Yong Zeng, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Guanding Yu, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
            <p>In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios.</p>

            <p>Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30% reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Cao, Zishuo Feng, Jicong Zhang, Wei Shi</p>
            <p>Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

            <h2>ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wen, Xiaoming Chen, Maojun Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.</p>

            <p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access, high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage. However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing, hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations, inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC jointly exploits communication, localization, and sensing functionalities, achieving synergistic gains in throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness through shared resources and cooperative design. We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna reconfigurability, and inter-satellite link design. The article concludes by outlining open research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future non-terrestrial networks.</p>

            <h2>A Convergent Generalized Krylov Subspace Method for Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction with Gradient-Driven Denoisers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Hong, Umberto Villa, Jeffrey A. Fessler</p>
            <p>Model-based reconstruction plays a key role in compressed sensing (CS) MRI, as it incorporates effective image regularizers to improve the quality of reconstruction. The Plug-and-Play and Regularization-by-Denoising frameworks leverage advanced denoisers (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers) and have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, their theoretical guarantees remain limited, as practical CNNs often violate key assumptions. In contrast, gradient-driven denoisers achieve competitive performance, and the required assumptions for theoretical analysis are easily satisfied. However, solving the associated optimization problem remains computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized Krylov subspace method (GKSM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Moreover, we also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for GKSM in nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with spiral and radial acquisitions validate both the computational efficiency of GKSM and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. The proposed optimization method is applicable to any linear inverse problem.</p>

            <p>High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated Interactive Auralization of Highly Reverberant Spaces using Graphics Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Rosseel, Toon van Waterschoot</p>
            <p>Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic environments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible, acoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis requires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters that model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in concert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time, resulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the convolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant latency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In this paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based auralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the acoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A comparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated convolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time performance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system integrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU, creating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes processing latency.</p>

            <h2>Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, Y. Thomas Hou</p>
            <p>Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Estimation with Limited Data Rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieming Ke, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information. Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples demonstrate the main results.</p>

In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</p>

            <p>Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a small draft model to predict multiple future tokens for verification by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this enables device-edge collaborative inference but introduces significant uplink overhead, as existing distributed speculative decoding schemes transmit full vocabulary logits at every step. We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability. Experiments show that TSLT significantly reduces uplink communication while maintaining end-to-end inference latency and model quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable, communication-efficient distributed LLM inference in future AI-RAN systems.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety.

            <p>Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Path Loss: Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Modeling for UAV Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf, İsmail Güvenç</p>
            <p>This paper presents a measurement-based framework for characterizing altitude-dependent spectral behavior of signals received by a tethered Helikite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models.</p>

            <p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. An inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Study on the Effectiveness of ASR Representations for Noise-Robust Speech Emotion Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohan Shi, Jiajun He, Xingfeng Li, Tomoki Toda</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an efficient attempt to noisy speech emotion recognition (NSER). Conventional NSER approaches have proven effective in mitigating the impact of artificial noise sources, such as white Gaussian noise, but are limited to non-stationary noises in real-world environments due to their complexity and uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new method for NSER by adopting the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as a noise-robust feature extractor to eliminate non-vocal information in noisy speech. We first obtain intermediate layer information from the ASR model as a feature representation for emotional speech and then apply this representation for the downstream NSER task. Our experimental results show that 1) the proposed method achieves better NSER performance compared with the conventional noise reduction method, 2) outperforms self-supervised learning approaches, and 3) even outperforms text-based approaches using ASR transcription or the ground truth transcription of noisy speech.</p>

            <p>We derive uniform all-time concentration bound of the type 'for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</p>

            <p>In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains >90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</p>

            <p>How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Analysis of Simultaneous Double Q-learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunjun Na, Donghwan Lee</p>
            <p>$Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite its widespread success in various applications, it is prone to overestimation bias in the $Q$-learning update. To address this issue, double $Q$-learning employs two independent $Q$-estimators which are randomly selected and updated during the learning process. This paper proposes a modified double $Q$-learning, called simultaneous double $Q$-learning (SDQ), with its finite-time analysis. SDQ eliminates the need for random selection between the two $Q$-estimators, and this modification allows us to analyze double $Q$-learning through the lens of a novel switching system framework facilitating efficient finite-time analysis. Empirical studies demonstrate that SDQ converges faster than double $Q$-learning while retaining the ability to mitigate the maximization bias. Finally, we derive a finite-time expected error bound for SDQ.</p>

            <p>Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) represent data features by learning the activation functions and demonstrate superior accuracy with fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory usage (Memory), shorter training time (TraT), and testing time (TesT) when handling low-dimensional data. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, which contains significant redundant information, the current activation mechanism of KANs leads to unnecessary computations, thereby reducing computational efficiency. KANs require reshaping high-dimensional data into a one-dimensional tensor as input, which inevitably results in the loss of dimensional information. To address these limitations, we propose weighted activation distribution KANs (WKANs), which reduce the frequency of activations per node and distribute node information into different output nodes through weights to avoid extracting redundant information. Furthermore, we introduce a multilevel tensor splitting framework (MTSF), which decomposes high-dimensional data to extract features from each dimension independently and leverages tensor-parallel computation to significantly improve the computational efficiency of WKANs on high-dimensional data. In this paper, we design SpectralKAN for hyperspectral image change detection using the proposed MTSF. SpectralKAN demonstrates outstanding performance across five datasets, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.9801 and a Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.9514 on the Farmland dataset, with only 8 k parameters, 0.07 M FLOPs, 911 MB Memory, 13.26 S TraT, and 2.52 S TesT, underscoring its superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

            <h2>TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nian Wu, Jiarui Xing, Miaomiao Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>SIGNL: A Label-Efficient Audio Deepfake Detection System via Spectral-Temporal Graph Non-Contrastive Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Falih Gozi Febrinanto, Kristen Moore, Chandra Thapa, Jiangang Ma, Vidya Saikrishna</p>
            <p>Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Cheng, Erjia Xiao, Jing Shao, Yichi Wang, Le Yang, Chao Shen, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Surface-Based Manipulation with Modular Foldable Robots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqiao Wang, Serhat Demirtas, Fabio Zuliani, Jamie Paik</p>
            <p>Intelligence lies not only in the brain (decision-making processes) but in the body (physical morphology). The morphology of robots can significantly influence how they interact with the physical world, crucial for manipulating objects in real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulty in establishing stable forces or geometric constraints. Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By adjusting surfaces' position and orientation, objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasping, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels and can even manipulate the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.</p>

            <h2>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov</p>
            <p>Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengrui Quan, Brian Wang, Kang Yang, Liying Han, Mani Srivastava</p>
            <p>Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.</p>

            <p>Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data.

This approach leverages synthetic EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and speech recordings.</p>

            <p>3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill dataset gaps, we propose a Realistic Anomaly Augmentation that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. Then, a novel framework that integrates OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, OccOoD, is proposed, which uses Cross-Space Semantic Refinement (CSSR) to refine semantic predictions from complementary voxel and BEV representations, improving OoD detection. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 65.50% and an AuPRCr of 31.83 within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive semantic occupancy prediction performance and generalization in real-world urban driving scenes.

            <p>Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.</p>

OpenYAMNet is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality, serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. OpenYAMNet achieved a mean average precision of 0.86 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories relevant to auditory scene recognition. Real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities were demonstrated on edge devices by deploying OpenYAMNet to an Android smartphone.

            <p>Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution.

Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</p>

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and backbone models demonstrate that NFP consistently improves classification performance compared to conventional pooling strategies, while maintaining computational efficiency.

            <p>Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

            <h2>PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huizheng Wang, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin</p>
            <p>Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency. This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria. We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.</p>

            <h2>Sketch&Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuang Shi, Géraldine Morin, Simone Gasparini, Wei Tsang Ooi</p>
            <p>We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail. In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</p>

            <h2>How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Nyangon, Brecht Seifi</p>
            <p>The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis A. Garcia-Reyes, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Vinícius A. Lacerda, Marc Cheah-Mañe</p>
            <p>This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.</p>

            <h2>LLM-DMD: Large Language Model-based Power System Dynamic Model Discovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Ke Zuo, Wenqi Huang, Mingyang Sun</p>
            <p>Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.</p>

            <h2>Explicit Reward Mechanisms for Local Flexibility in Renewable Energy Communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Stegen, Julien Allard, Noé Diffels, François Vallée, Mevludin Glavic, Zacharie De Grève, Bertrand Cornélusse</p>
            <p>Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Spectral Clustering of Low-Inertia Power Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerald Ogbonna, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.</p>

            <p>A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.</p>

            <h2>Invisible Walls: Privacy-Preserving ISAC Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</h2>

            <p>The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.</p>

            <h2>Definition and Formulation of Inertia Service Incorporating Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojin Park, Ross Baldick, Hunyoung Shin</p>
            <p>Increasing concerns over the scarcity of inertia have motivated the procurement of inertia as an ancillary service (AS). Despite numerous academic and practical efforts, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and treatment of inertia service in market operations, particularly the specification of inertia variables and the separation between synchronous inertia (SI) from synchronous generators and virtual inertia (VI) from inverter-based resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a power-oriented (P-oriented) definition based on inertial response, which establishes conceptual consistency between SI and VI and makes the inertia service commensurable with other ASs. This definition explicitly incorporates both positive and negative inertial responses during frequency drop events. We then formulate a security-constrained economic dispatch framework based on this P-oriented definition and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through simulations. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed bidirectional service definition ensures price signals that reflect the economic value of inertial provision.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Dispatch Decisions on Small-Signal Stability of Converter-Dominated Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitraya Avadhut Desai, Ognjen Stanojev, Simon Muntwiler, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Small-signal stability of modern converter-dominated power systems has been the subject of extensive research, particularly from the perspective of device-level control design for grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) converters. However, the influence of power flow variables on system stability has received limited attention. Conventional small-signal stability analyses are typically conducted at a specific operating point, emphasizing the selection of control or system design parameters while neglecting the sensitivity of stability characteristics to operating conditions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by systematically investigating the impact of dispatch decisions on the small-signal stability of converter-based power systems. Our findings are first illustrated on a three-bus system and then validated on the standard IEEE 39-bus test system to demonstrate scalability. Across the test systems, we find that high-voltage capacitive operation of GFL converters limits its active power injection, whereas inductive operation permits higher injections, and it is generally preferable for the GFM converter to supply more active power.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based framework for detecting cyberattacks on transformer current differential relays (TCDRs), which, if undetected, may trigger false tripping of critical transformers. The proposed approach adapts and fine-tunes compact LLMs such as DistilBERT to distinguish cyberattacks from actual faults using textualized multidimensional TCDR current measurements recorded before and after tripping. Our results demonstrate that DistilBERT detects 97.6% of cyberattacks without compromising TCDR dependability and achieves inference latency below 6 ms on a commercial workstation. Additional evaluations confirm the framework's robustness under combined time-synchronization and false-data-injection attacks, resilience to measurement noise, and stability across prompt formulation variants. Furthermore, GPT-2 and DistilBERT+LoRA achieve comparable performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity.

            <p>Without requiring operational costs such as cabling and powering while maintaining reconfigurable phase-shift capability, self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ssRISs) can be deployed in locations inaccessible to conventional relays or base stations, offering a novel approach to enhance wireless coverage. This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong</p>
            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianan Bai, Anubhab Chowdhury, Anders Hansson, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boshuai Zhao, Adam Abdin, Jakob Puchinger</p>
            <p>The Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP) optimizes routing and scheduling for electric autonomous vehicles to transport customers from origins to destinations. It features a combined objective that minimizes travel cost and excess user ride time, and allows partial recharging. Motivated by practical scenarios where time and battery data are available with limited precision, we introduce a discrete variant of the problem, termed D-E-ADARP, in which all time and battery parameters are discretized. This enables the development of our alternative solution approach: the discrete battery-time-space fragment-based formulation (BTSFF). In this framework, a fragment represents a subpath with an associated cost that accounts for both travel cost and excess user ride time. The BTSFF network integrates spatial, temporal, and battery dimensions, with the latter two discretized into finite indices. Computational results show that BTSFF solves D-E-ADARP significantly more efficiently than existing methods applied to the original E-ADARP. In addition, BTSFF efficiently provides high-quality lower bounds for E-ADARP and accelerates solving its battery swap variants. For E-ADARP, a relaxed network is constructed by rounding down travel times and battery consumptions, enabling a valid lower bound. For battery swap variants, BTSFF integrates lazy constraints via callbacks to correct time discretization errors, guaranteeing optimal solutions. Experiments show BTSFF outperforms benchmark methods in efficiency.</p>

            <p>High altitude platform station (HAPS) systems are becoming crucial facilitators for future wireless communication networks, enhancing connectivity across all vertical communication layers, including small Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices, terrestrial users, and aerial devices. In the context of the widely recognized vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture, HAPS systems can provide service to both aerial and ground users. However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Moreover, we explore the system in terms of throughput. The findings reveal that harnessing full potential of EH stands as a viable approach to meet the energy demands of HAPS systems.</p>

            <p>Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Osasumwen Cedric Ogiesoba-Eguakun, Suman Rath</p>
            <p>Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeyeon Park, Jiyu Lee, Junyeol Maeng, Shenghui Cui</p>
            <p>This paper presents a sub-switching period current-limiting control for a grid-tied inverter to prevent transient overcurrents during grid faults and enable seamless fault ride-through (FRT). Sudden grid-voltage disturbances, such as voltage sags or phase jumps, can induce large transient currents within a switching period, particularly at low switching frequencies. Upon disturbance detection, the proposed method immediately modifies the pulse-width modulation carrier, enabling continuous regulation of the inverter output current within a time much shorter than a switching period without interrupting current flow. The proposed method can be implemented on commonly used digital signal processors without requiring specialized analog or digital circuits or high-speed computing devices.

            <h2>Accounting for Optimal Control in the Sizing of Isolated Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems Using Imitation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Halvdansson, Lucas Ferreira Bernardino, Brage Rugstad Knudsen</p>
            <p>Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.</p>

            <h2>Multi-agent Optimization of Non-cooperative Multimodal Mobility Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Nafees Fuad Rafi, Zhaomiao Guo</p>
            <p>While multimodal mobility systems have the potential to bring many benefits to travelers, drivers, the environment, and traffic congestion, such systems typically involve multiple non-cooperative decision-makers who may selfishly optimize their own objectives without considering the overall system benefits. This paper aims to investigate market-based interactions of travelers and ride-sourcing drivers in the context of multimodal mobility systems. We propose a unified mathematical modeling framework to capture the decentralized travelers and drivers' decision-making process and balance the network's demand and supply by equilibrium pricing. Such a model allows analyses of the impact of decentralized decision-making on multimodal mobility efficiencies. The proposed formulation can be further convexified to efficiently compute the equilibrium ride-sourcing prices. We conduct numerical experiments on different settings of transportation networks to gain policy insights. We find that travelers prefer ride-sourcing and multimodal transportation more than the driving option when they are more sensitive to prices. We also find that travelers may need to be subsidized to use multimodal transportation when there is fewer transit hubs in the network or, ride-sourcing drivers become too sensitive to the prices. However, we find that more transit hubs in the network increases the total empty VMT of ride-sourcing drivers by increasing the total relocation time. The proposed model can be used by policymakers and platform operators to design pricing and subsidy schemes that align individual decision-making with system-level efficiency and evaluate the trade-offs between accessibility and environmental impacts in multimodal transportation networks.</p>

            <h2>Flexible-Duplex Cell-Free Architecture for Secure Uplink Communications in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Shi, Wei Xu, Yongming Huang, Jiacheng Yao, Wenhao Hu, Dongming Wang</p>
            <p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.</p>

            <h2>Economic zone data-enabled predictive control for connected open water systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoqiao Chen, Xuewen Zhang, Minghao Han, Adrian Wing-Keung Law, Xunyuan Yin</p>
            <p>The real-time operation of open water systems is essential for ensuring operational safety, satisfying operational requirements, and optimizing energy usage. However, existing rule-based control strategies rely heavily on human experience, while model-based approaches depend on accurate hydrodynamic models, which limit their applicability to water systems with complex dynamics and uncertain disturbances. In this work, we develop a fully data-driven, zone-based control framework with adaptive control target zone selection for safe and energy-efficient operation of connected open water systems. Specifically, we propose a mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach that aims to maintain the water levels of the branches within the desired water-level zone while reducing real-time operational energy consumption. The DeePC-based approach enables direct use of input-output data for predictive control, eliminating the need for explicit dynamic modeling. To handle multiple control objectives with different priorities, we employ lexicographic optimization and reformulate the traditional DeePC cost function to incorporate zone tracking and energy consumption minimization objectives. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is utilized to determine the control target zone, which enables an effective trade-off between zone tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water levels within the desired water-level zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 hour. Compared to rule-based control method, the proposed method lowers zone-violation frequency by 74.96% and the average energy consumption by 22.44%.</p>

            <h2>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong</p>
            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</p>

            <h2>Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer for Predicting Smart Grid Failures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh Le, Phat K. Huynh, Om P. Yadav, Harun Pirim, Chau Le, Trung Q. Le</p>
            <p>Smart grid infrastructure needs improved resilience and preventive maintenance through more accurate predictions. Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework. The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction.</p>

            <h2>Post-Earthquake Restoration of Electricity-Gas Distribution Systems with Damage Information Collection and Repair Vehicle Routing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingxuan Li, Wei Wei, Yin Xu, Chengeng Zhang, Shanshan Shi</p>
            <p>Extreme events such as earthquakes pose significant threats to integrated electricity-gas distribution systems (IEGDS) by causing widespread damage. Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an outage cost comparable to the ideal solution, and reduces the total outage cost by more than 15% compared to strategies based on stochastic programming and heuristic methods.</p>

            <h2>From inconsistency to decision: explainable operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingbo Qu, Yijie Wang, Yujie Fu, Putai Zhang, Weihan Li, Mian Li</p>
            <p>Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are increasingly critical to power-system stability, yet their operation and maintenance remain dominated by reactive, expert-dependent diagnostics. While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Laws of Machine Learning for Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyi Liu, Xuan He, Yize Chen</p>
            <p>Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.</p>

            <h2>Joint BS Deployment and Power Optimization for Minimum EMF Exposure with RL in Real-World Based Urban Scenario</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueyun Long, Yueheng Li, Mario Pauli, Benjamin Nuss, Thomas Zwick</p>
            <p>Base station (BS) deployment remains a critical task with successive wireless communication generations and increasing data rates demands, while the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is often underrated, yielding potential health implications. Therefore, this paper proposes a workflow that adjusts BS deployment and radiated power in a 3D urban scenario to jointly consider EMF exposure and coverage. To achieve this ambition, firstly, a novel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) tool is developed to improve computational efficiency, and simultaneously enhance diffraction modeling} for accurate EMF exposure calculation, validated with real-world measurements. To efficiently extend the computation across the target urban area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed based on the spatial stability of the effective channel while accounting for BS beamforming, enabling global estimation of EMF exposure and signal coverage. Subsequently, to better represent real-world communication network behaviors, the actual maximum transmit power, intercell interference, and channel state information imperfection are incorporated on the BS side, while mobility over the EMF exposure averaging interval is captured on the user equipment side. Upon the aforementioned aspects, the coverage-guaranteed EMF exposure minimization problem is formulated in a realistic and accurate manner, and solved by a geometry-aware algorithm adapted to deterministic channel models, yielding the optimal BS deployment and power configuration. In comparison to a baseline that relies on an empirical channel model, the proposed workflow delivers more reliable estimation of EMF exposure and provides practical guidance for BS construction and operations.</p>

            <p>The principle of learning from errors is pedagogically powerful but often impractical in industrial settings due to risks to safety and equipment.

Operator actions and errors are simulated via experimentable digital twins (EDTs), and the consequences of errors are visualized in AR, enabling safe, experiential learning. A Petri Net model formally represents the process, including typical faults and recovery paths, and is implemented in VEROSIM using SOML++. This hybrid framework provides a scalable foundation for AR-guided training systems that reduce risk and accelerate skill acquisition.</p>

            <p>This study examines long-term CO$_2$ emission trajectories across five major economies: Nigeria, the United States, China, Brazil, and Russia, by integrating national energy-mix characteristics with time-series forecasting models. Annual emissions from 2000-2023 were analyzed alongside energy production data to classify countries into fossil-dependent, transition-phase, or renewable-accelerated profiles. Three forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R$^2$ metrics. Results show that Holt-Winters provided the most accurate forecasts for Nigeria, the United States, China, and Brazil, while SARIMA performed best for Russia due to its relatively stable emissions. Long-term projections from 2024 to 2060 indicate divergent decarbonization pathways. Brazil aligns most closely with a low-emission future owing to its renewable-dominant energy system, whereas Nigeria continues on an upward emissions trajectory driven by fossil dependence. The United States and China maintain moderate declines but require accelerated mitigation to reach their respective net-zero commitments. Russia's emissions remain largely flat under current conditions. These findings highlight the strong influence of energy structures on national decarbonization prospects and underscore the need for targeted energy policy reforms to align with global climate objectives.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a hybrid hydrogen electrolyzer-supercapacitor system (HESS) with a novel control strategy for renewable-dominant power grids. The HESS consists of alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL), and supercapacitors (SC). The interfacing inverters between HESS and power grid are regulated by an inertia emulation control strategy. From HESS, AEL is with conventional DC power control, whereas PEMEL and SC are designed with the proposed dynamic inertia control and capacitive inertia control, respectively. Benefitting from the coordination of three controls, within the HESS, high-frequency transient power components are autonomously handled by SC, stable frequency power components are regulated by PEMEL, and low-frequency steady-state power is addressed by AEL, characterized by low operational gains and longer lifetimes. SC delivers transient power, significantly alleviating energy losses on electrolyzers and achieving adequate inertia recovery capabilities while requiring no additional communication. Implementing SOC recovery control enables the SC to withstand more than three times more stability discharge cycles compared to an SC without SOC recovery. Furthermore, a large-signal mathematical model based on mixed potential theory is established, providing clear stability boundaries for system parameters. Dynamic analyses theoretically verify system feasibility, and extensive hardware-in-the-loop experimental results fully validate the proposed HESS along with the corresponding transient power allocation controls.</p>

            <p>An operational optimization strategy for microgrid energy storage systems (ESSs) is developed to address practical user-oriented application requirements, and its effectiveness is validated using real-world operational data. First, a fundamental ESS model is established to characterize system dynamics and operational constraints, providing a theoretical basis for optimization. Subsequently, a multi-objective operational optimization framework is formulated to simultaneously minimize electricity cost, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance renewable energy utilization. To ensure computational efficiency and scalability, the commercial optimization solver Gurobi is employed. The proposed strategy is evaluated using actual microgrid operational data, demonstrating that the developed ESS model accurately represents real system constraints. Compared with existing user operational strategies, the proposed approach achieves an average reduction of 13.47% in electricity cost. Moreover, by dynamically adjusting the weighting factors of the multi-objective formulation, the strategy enables flexible operational modes and significantly improves adaptability to varying operating scenarios. In addition, the proposed framework provides decision support for user-side microgrids participating in surplus electricity feed-in policies. The main contribution of this work lies in its user-centric optimization design, which enhances operational flexibility and scenario adaptability through multi-objective weight allocation, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world microgrid ESS operation.</p>

            <p>Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
            <p>Parallel cyber--physical attacks (PCPA) can simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and disrupt measurement data transmission in power grids, severely impairing system situational awareness and attack diagnosis. This paper investigates the attack diagnosis problem for linearized AC/DC power flow models under PCPA, where physical attacks include not only line disconnections but also admittance modifications, such as those caused by compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-assisted attack diagnosis framework based on meta--mixed-integer programming (MMIP), which integrates a convolutional graph cross-attention attack localization (CGCA-AL) model. First, sufficient conditions for measurement reconstruction are derived, enabling the recovery of unknown measurements in attacked areas using available measurements and network topology information. Based on these conditions, the attack diagnosis problem is formulated as an MMIP model. The proposed CGCA-AL employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to predict a probability distribution over potential physical attack locations, which is incorporated into the MMIP as informative objective coefficients. By solving the resulting MMIP, both the locations and magnitudes of physical attacks are optimally estimated, and system states are subsequently reconstructed. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed attack diagnosis framework under complex PCPA scenarios.</p>

            <p>Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Gokul Krishnan, Mohd. Asim Aftab, Nabil Mohammed, Shehab Ahmed, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The decarbonization of the energy sector has led to a significant high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.</p>

            <p>This study considers a point-to-point wireless link, in which both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains.</p>

            <p>Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</p>

            <h2>Dual-Scale Channel Estimation in Sensing-Assisted Communication Systems: Joint Time Allocation and Beamforming Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bai Zhiyue, Dai Minghui, Hou Fen, Shan hangguan, Cai X Lin, Shen (Sherman)Xuemin</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled dual-scale channel estimation framework, where large-scale channel estimation benefits from sensing, and the temporal variation of small-scale channel state information is modeled via channel aging. By characterizing the impact of angular sensing error on the communication spatial correlation matrix, we derive a closed form expression for the achievable rate under dual-scale channel estimation errors. Considering the different characteristics in time scales, we design the sensing duration for slow-varying large-scale channel and determine the update timing and frequency for fast-varying small-scale channel information within a given frame structure. We formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem under limited time resources and sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints, and propose a segmented golden based joint optimization algorithm to efficiently solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes, which further validate that the system can leverage additional sensing capabilities to enhance communication efficiency.</p>

            <h2>RUL-QMoE: Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life Predictions of Varying Battery Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sel Ly, Rufan Yang, Ninad Dixit, Hung Dinh Nguyen</p>
            <p>Lithium-ion batteries are the major type of battery used in a variety of everyday applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), mobile devices, and energy storage systems. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the economic and technical feasibility of integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology in the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) sector. These often-idling assets, with their substantial battery capacities, present a unique opportunity to participate in energy markets, providing grid services and generating additional revenue. A novel methodology is introduced that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the energy infrastructure together with an operating strategy optimization to reduce the electricity costs while enhancing grid interaction. While the focus lies on the methodology, the financial opportunities for the use-case of an electric NRMM rental service will be presented. However, the study is limited by the availability of real-world data on the usage of electric NRMM and does not address regulatory challenges of V2G. Further research is needed to extend the model accuracy and validate these findings.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Voltage and Current Control Method for Harmonic Mitigation of Single-Phase AC Loads in DC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Baharizadeh, Mohammad Sadegh Golsorkhi, Neda Keshavarzi, Thomas Ebel</p>
            <p>DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.</p>

            <h2>A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Zijun Chen, Haiwang Zhong, Di Cao, Guangchun Ruan</p>
            <p>In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</p>

            <p>With great flexibility to adjust antenna positions, pinching antennas (PAs) are promising for alleviating large-scale attenuation in wireless networks. In this work, we investigate the antenna positioning and beamforming (AP-BF) design in a multi-PA multi-user system under probabilistic light-of-sight (LoS) blockage and formulate a power minimization problem subject to per-user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For a single PA, we prove the convexity of the simplified problem and obtain its global optimum. For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya, Sajad Khodadadian, Taylan G. Topcu</p>
            <p>As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a confidence level-based distributionally information gap decision theory (CL-DIGDT) framework for the two-stage robust optimal operation of distribution networks, aiming at deriving an optimal operational scheme capable of addressing asymmetric uncertainties related to renewable energy and load demands. Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.</p>

            <p>This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach.</p>

The scenario evaluation showed that interconnecting photovoltaic (PV), biomass generator (BG), wind power (WP), diesel generator (DG), battery, and converter can effectively provide the Hospital's daily energy consumption of 11,214.66 kWh while conforming reliability and reducing emissions. The PV/BG/batt/conv configuration emerged as the most cost-effective and sustainable alternative, attaining the lowest LCOE of \$0.339/kWh, an NPC of \$25.7 million, and a 100% renewable energy fraction with simple pay back of 7.26 yr. As a result, the operational cost associated with the consumption of 500.00 L of diesel per month can be entirely avoided. The DG-integrated hybrids exhibit advanced techno-economic capability with significant worth, strong ROI (20\%) and IRR (18\%), endorsed by fast capital recovery (7.21-8.71 years). Overall, the hybrid system offers an optimal balance of cost, reliability, and sustainability, making it a promising and scalable solution for electrification of energy scare institution and areas in Ethiopia, thereby contributing to national sustainable energy development goals.</p>

            <h2>A Learning-Driven Stochastic Hybrid System Framework for Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari</p>
            <p>This paper presents a new learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) framework designed for the detection and classification of contingencies in modern power systems. Unlike conventional monitoring schemes, the proposed approach is capable of identifying unobservable events that remain hidden from standard sensing infrastructures, such as undetected protection system malfunctions. The framework operates by analyzing deviations in system outputs and behaviors, which are then categorized into three groups: physical, control, and measurement contingencies based on their impact on the SHS model. The SHS model integrates both system dynamics and observer-driven state estimation error dynamics. Within this architecture, machine learning classifiers are employed to achieve rapid and accurate categorization of contingencies. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus systems, where results indicate substantial improvements in both detection speed and accuracy compared with existing approaches.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources.

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then synthesize speech based on the translated units and source speaker's identity using a conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace, while achieving competitive translation performance.

            <h2>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Schildbach</p>
            <p>Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Svyatoslav Covanov, Cedric Pradalier</p>
            <p>This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach.</p>

            <h2>Combined Learning of Linear Parameter-Varying Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Alberto Bemporad</p>
            <p>Dynamical models identified from data are frequently employed in control system design. However, decoupling system identification from controller synthesis can result in situations where no suitable controller exists after a model has been identified. In this work, we introduce a novel control-oriented regularization in the identification procedure to ensure the existence of a controller that can enforce constraints on system variables robustly. The combined identification algorithm includes: (i) the concurrent learning of an uncertain model and a nominal model using an observer; (ii) a regularization term on the model parameters defined as the size of the largest robust control invariant set for the uncertain model. To make the learning problem tractable, we consider nonlinear models in quasi Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) form, utilizing a novel scheduling function parameterization that facilitates the derivation of an associated uncertain linear model. The robust control invariant set is represented as a polytope, and we adopt novel results from polytope geometry to derive the regularization function as the optimal value of a convex quadratic program. Additionally, we present new model-reduction approaches that exploit the chosen model structure. Numerical examples on classical identification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A simple control scheme is also derived to provide an example of data-driven control of a constrained nonlinear system.</p>

            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but suffered from prolonged acquisition time. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to accelerate acquisition and demonstrate promising performance, they rely on high-quality fully-sampled datasets for training in a supervised manner. However, such datasets are time-consuming and expensive-to-collect, which constrains their broader applications. On the other hand, self-supervised methods offer an alternative by enabling learning from under-sampled data alone, but most existing methods rely on further partitioned under-sampled k-space data as model's input for training, resulting in a loss of valuable information. Additionally, their models have not fully incorporated image priors, leading to degraded reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel re-visible dual-domain self-supervised deep unfolding network to address these issues when only under-sampled datasets are available. Specifically, by incorporating re-visible dual-domain loss, all under-sampled k-space data are utilized during training to mitigate information loss caused by further partitioning. This design enables the model to implicitly adapt to all under-sampled k-space data as input. Additionally, we design a deep unfolding network based on Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (DUN-CP-PPA) to achieve end-to-end reconstruction, incorporating imaging physics and image priors to guide the reconstruction process. By employing a Spatial-Frequency Feature Extraction (SFFE) block to capture global and local feature representation, we enhance the model's efficiency to learn comprehensive image priors. Experiments conducted on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction performance.</p>

            <p>Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences.

            <p>The increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) requires efficient route planning solutions that take into account the limited range of EVs and the associated charging times, as well as the different types of charging stations. In this work, we model and solve an electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) designed for a cross-platform navigation system for individual transport. The aim is to provide users with an efficient route for their daily appointments and to reduce possible inconveniences caused by charging their EV. Based on these assumptions, we propose a multi-day model in the form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that takes into account the vehicle's battery capacity and the time windows of user's appointments. The model is solved using various established metaheuristics, including tabu search (TS), adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), and ant colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the performance of the individual approaches is analyzed using generated ensembles to estimate their behavior in reality and is compared with the exact results of the Google OR-Tools solver.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhu, Yu Yang, Liang Yu, Qing-Shan Jia, Costas J. Spanos, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system dominates building's energy consumption and meanwhile exhibits substantial operational flexibility that can be exploited for providing grid services. However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khaled Bin Walid, Feng Ye, Jiaxiang Ji, Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, Travis Miles, Yazhou Leo Jiang</p>
            <p>This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</p>

This paper formulates a techno economic siting problem in which each candidate data center site is mapped to a bus of the distribution network and is assumed to deploy on site renewable generation and power electronic interfaces, resulting in a controllable net active power injection equivalent to distributed generation. A mixed integer nonlinear optimization model is developed to jointly select the connection bus and size the DG capacity while respecting network operating limits. The objective combines three normalized terms including active power losses, a voltage deviation index capturing profile quality, and investment cost derived from location dependent land price and unit DG cost. To address the discrete continuous search space, an intelligent genetic algorithm is embedded in a multi scenario decision framework with adaptive weight tuning. Three stakeholder scenarios prioritize losses, voltage quality, or techno economic balance, and additional balanced scenarios are generated automatically until the optimal bus decision converges. A case study on the IEEE 33 bus radial system demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The converged design selects bus 14 with 1.10 MW DG, reducing total losses from 202.67 kW to 129.37 kW while improving the minimum bus voltage to 0.933 per unit at a moderate investment cost of 1.33 MUSD. The proposed framework provides an interpretable pathway to integrate economic indicators into distribution aware data center siting.</p>

            <h2>Low-cost Pyranometer-Based ANN Approach for MPPT in Solar PV Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiz Fernando M. Arruda, Moises Ferber, Diego Greff</p>
            <p>This article presents a study on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems using low-cost pyranometer sensors. The proposed approach integrates pyranometers, temperature sensors, and an ANN to estimate the duty cycle of a DC/DC converter, enabling the system to consistently operate at its maximum power point. The strategy was implemented in the local control of a Cuk converter and experimentally validated against the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based technique, leveraging affordable sensor technology, achieves accurate MPPT performance with reduced fluctuations, enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of PV tracking systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Rolling Allocation of Outages for Damage Assesment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hritik Gopal Shah, Catherine Tajmajer, Elli Ntakou</p>
            <p>Natural disasters often inflict severe damage on distribution grids. Rapid, reliable damage assessment (DA) is essential for storm restoration, yet most optimization work targets repair dispatch after faults are identified. This paper presents a production, rolling horizon DA crew allocation system deployed across multiple U.S. states in Eversource Energy's service territory and used during live storms. The method implements a sequential k-job assignment policy per available crew, executed on a fixed cadence and on operators' control. The objective jointly prioritizes critical facilities and customer impact while controlling travel time on the actual road network via the Google Maps API. A key constraint is the absence of live crew GPS; we infer crew locations from the last confirmed DA site and robustify travel estimates for staleness, yielding stable recommendations without continuous tracking. The operator remains in the loop with controls to limit churn and to publish a feasible plan. Using data from the March 7 New Hampshire storm with 90 moderate outages and seven DA crews, we observe shorter time to first assessment, fewer revisits with reduced distance traveled. To our knowledge, this is among the first multi-state enterprise integrated deployments to treat DA crews as a first-class optimized resource in storm restoration.</p>

            <p>Underground pumped hydro energy storage (UPHES) systems play a critical role in grid-scale energy storage for renewable integration, yet optimal day-ahead scheduling remains computationally prohibitive due to nonlinear turbine performance characteristics and discrete operational modes. This paper presents a decision-focused learning (DFL) framework that addresses the computational-accuracy trade-off in UPHES day-ahead scheduling. The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark. Thus, the presented DFL framework enables flexible prioritization between profit maximization and real-time responsiveness.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Sadi</p>
            <p>As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.</p>

            <p>This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zar Chi Phyo, Shreya Khisa, Chadi Assi, Sanaa Sharafaddine</p>
            <p>This paper investigates a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for uplink pinching antenna system (PASS). Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods.</p>

            <h2>Robust and Secure Transmission for Movable-RIS Assisted ISAC with Imperfect Sense Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Zhuang, Ximing Xie, Fang Fang, Ali Attaran, Zhizhong Zhang</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface.</p>

            <p>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems enable cellular networks to jointly operate as communication technology and sense the environment. While opportunities and potential performance have been largely investigated in simulations, few experimental works have showcased Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) effectiveness in a real-world deployment based on cellular radio units. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an initial study investigating the feasibility of ATR for ISAC. Our ATR solution uses a Deep Learning (DL)-based detector to infer the target class directly from the radar images generated by the ISAC system. The DL detector is evaluated with experimental data from a ISAC testbed based on commercially available mmWave radio units in the ARENA 2036 industrial research campus located in Stuttgart, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate accurate classification performance, demonstrating the feasibility of ATR ISAC with cellular hardware in our setup. We finally provide insights about the open generalization challenges, that will fuel future work on the topic.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Christos Masouros, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extend the coverage but yield marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Roh, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</p>

Two key aspects are examined: the dependence of the DBD electrical model on reactor geometry, and application-driven requirements for injected waveform characteristics, including shapes, voltage amplitude, frequency, and modulation techniques. On this basis, the paper systematically reviews two major categories of power supplies: sinusoidal types comprising transformerless and transformer-based resonant inverters, and pulsed power supplies (PPSs). The review summarizes performance trade-offs, highlights untested topologies and emerging applications, and offers guidance for advancing high-performance DBD power supply design for next-generation systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Deakin, Rahmat Heidari, Xu Deng</p>
            <p>The mitigation of unbalanced grid voltages or currents by voltage source converters results in power ripple on the dc link, and is a key converter design parameter due to hardware or stability considerations. Despite the importance of this issue for system design and operation, the use of Optimal Power Flow (OPF)-based methods capturing the interaction between dc link ripple and converter unbalanced operation has been largely unexplored. In this work, the magnitude of the power ripple is derived for generic multi-terminal converters, then introduced as a bilinear OPF constraint for two-level converter topologies. OPF case studies demonstrate the necessity to model both neutral current and dc link ripple, with tradeoffs between capacitor sizing and leg sizing highlighted for phase current unbalance mitigation applications. Time domain simulations of a grid-connected four-wire voltage source converter verify the accuracy and validity of the algebraic formulation. It is concluded that awareness of dc link ripple impacts and constraints will be of growing importance for distribution system operators.</p>

            <p>We study optimal charging of large electric vehicle populations that are exposed to a single real-time imbalance price. The problem is naturally cast as a multistage stochastic linear programme (MSLP), which can be solved by algorithms such as Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming. However, these methods scale poorly with the number of devices and stages. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this curse of dimensionality. Building prior work that characterises the aggregate flexibility sets of populations of EVs as a permutahdron, we reformulate the original problem in terms of aggregated quantities. The geometric structure of permutahedra lets us (i) construct an optimal disaggregation policy, (ii) derive an exact, lower-dimensional MSLP, and (iii) characterise the expected recourse function as piecewise affine with a finite, explicit partition. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the slopes and intercepts of each affine region via truncated expectations of future prices, yielding an exact form for the recourse function and first-stage policy. Comprehensive numerical studies validate our claims and demonstrate the practical utility of this work.</p>

            <h2>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gokul Puthumanaillam, Paulo Padrao, Jose Fuentes, Leonardo Bobadilla, Melkior Ornik</p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semih Cayci</p>
            <p>In this work, we establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for the Gauss-Newton method in training neural networks with smooth activations. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow in parameter space induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional embedded submanifold of the function space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we establish geodesic Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Lipschitz-smoothness conditions for the loss under appropriately chosen output scaling, yielding geometric convergence to the optimal in-class predictor at an explicit rate independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix. In the overparameterized regime, we propose adaptive, curvature-aware regularization schedules that ensure fast geometric convergence to a global optimum at a rate independent of the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel and, locally, of the modulus of strong convexity of the loss. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Newton achieves accelerated convergence rates in settings where first-order methods exhibit slow convergence due to ill-conditioned kernel matrices and loss landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ningwei Bai, Chi Pui Chan, Qichen Yin, Tengyang Gong, Yunda Yan, Zezhi Tang</p>
            <p>This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faisal Ahmed</p>
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans. We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification. PseudoColorViT-Alz offers a robust and interpretable framework that outperforms current methods, providing a promising tool to support clinical decision-making and early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative Energy Scheduling of Multi-Microgrids Based on Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongxiang Zhang, Bo Li, Jinghua Li, Yuguang Song, Ziqing Zhu, Wentao Yang, Zhengmao Li, Edris Pouresmaeil, Joshua Y. Kim</p>
            <p>With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy, multi-microgrids play an increasingly important role in improving the flexibility and reliability of energy supply. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance.</p>

            <h2>Dispatch-Aware Learning for Optimal Transmission Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Andy Sun, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability and generalization ability.</p>

            <h2>Techno-Economic Case Study of a Rural Local Electricity Community in Switzerland</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerard Marias Gonzalez, Alejandro Pena-Bello, Jérémy Dumoulin, Nicolas Wyrsch</p>
            <p>Local Electricity Communities (communautés électriques locales, CEL) will become operational in Switzerland in 2026, allowing prosumers, consumers, and storage operators within the same municipality and distribution system operator (DSO) area to exchange electricity over the public grid with reduced distribution tariffs. This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying the Dunkelflaute -- An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Kittel, Wolf-Peter Schill</p>
            <p>Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Joint Coverage and Electromagnetic Field Exposure Analysis in Downlink and Uplink for RIS-assisted Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Chen, Ahmed Elzanaty, Mustafa A Kishk, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage, especially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted large-scale networks remain open issues. This paper proposes a stochastic geometry (SG) based framework to characterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios. Particularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of RISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power control mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed framework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in downlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided. Additionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a user to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient identification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs. From numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the downlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved SINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS deployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE compliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics through joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in improving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can contribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between coverage and compliance when deploying RISs.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Voltage Control of AC Microgrids with Constant Power Loads using Control Barrier Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grigoris Michos, George C. Konstantopoulos</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of time-varying constant power loads. Modelling the load demand as a constantly evolving unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, \ie uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. By adopting a suitable control barrier function, we formulate a continuous-time control law and derive analytic conditions on the tuning parameters, such that the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories is bounded. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated both via simulation and real-time HIL scenarios, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.</p>

            <p>Designing controllers that simultaneously achieve strong performance and provable closed-loop stability remains a central challenge in control engineering. This work introduces a diffusion-based generative framework for linear controller synthesis grounded in the Youla-Kucera parameterization, enabling the construction of stabilizing controllers by design. The diffusion model learns a conditional mapping from plant dynamics and desired performance metrics to feasible Youla parameters, guaranteeing internal stability while flexibly accommodating user-specified targets. Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.</p>

It employs an identifiable-model-based controller and predictor, coupled with an iterative loop that updates model parameters using the error between a measurable output and its prediction. Simulations on electromechanical switching devices show effective tracking of the desired position trajectory using only coil current measurements.</p>

            <h2>Black-Start Power Capacity Sizing and Control Strategy for an Islanded DFIG Wind-to-Hydrogen System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bosen Yang, Kang Ma, Jin Lin, Yonghua Song</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p>Scheduling and loading of chillers in a multi-chiller plant is considered. A new framework is introduced considering an extended set of independent variables for the optimization problem of energy consumption. In this way the number of decision variables is increased, providing extra degrees of freedom to optimize cooling plant operation. The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation solution is deployed for the problem and the proposed method is compared with a similar but static approach showing the benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption.</p>

            <p>Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.</p>

            <p>Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.</p>

            <p>We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low computational complexity on average.</p>

            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose the method of hull clustering with blended RPs to enhance traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), approximating the full time horizon more accurately and with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>The integration of heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capability can enhance primary frequency response and improve stability in power systems with high renewable penetration. This study evaluates the technical potential of heavy-duty EV fleets to support the California power grid under three practical charging strategies: immediate charging, delayed charging, and constant-minimum-power charging. We develop a simulation framework that couples aggregated frequency dynamics with battery and charger constraints, state-of-charge management, and fleet-availability profiles. Performance is assessed using standard frequency security metrics, including nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, overshoot, and settling time, across credible contingency scenarios and renewable generation conditions. Results indicate that both non-V2G modes and V2G-enabled operation can contribute meaningful primary response, with V2G providing the strongest and fastest support while respecting mobility and network limits. Sensitivity analyses show that the relative benefits depend on charging strategy, control parameters, and renewable output, highlighting design trade-offs between response magnitude, duration, and battery usage. Overall, heavy-duty EV fleets-when coordinated by appropriate charging and V2G controls-offer a viable resource for strengthening primary frequency control on the California grid and mitigating stability challenges associated with increasing renewable penetration.</p>

            <p>The increasing electrification of human activities and the rapid integration of variable renewable energy sources strain the power grid. A solution to address the need for more grid storage is to use the battery of electric vehicles as a back-up capacity. However, drivers tend to disconnect their electric vehicle when its battery is needed the most. We propose a charge scheduler that incentivizes drivers to delay their disconnection to improve vehicle-to-grid services. We also leverage drivers' temporal flexibility to alleviate congestion in oversubscribed charging stations. We formulate the computation of an optimal flexible schedule as a mixed-integer quadratic problem. We tractably approximate its solution using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Considering the possibility that strategic drivers misreport their charging preferences to the station coordinator, we then propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism that incentivizes truthful reporting. We conclude with a simulated case study using real-world data to quantitatively assess the added value of drivers' temporal flexibility for enhancing vehicle-to-grid services and reducing station congestion.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable generation has significantly reduced system inertia, making modern power grids more vulnerable to rapid frequency deviations following disturbances. While a wide range of flexible resources-including electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-have demonstrated the physical capability to provide fast frequency response (FFR), existing studies primarily focus on individual resource performance or controller-level designs. A systematic framework that translates heterogeneous FFR capabilities into deployable, system-level frequency services remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a service-oriented coordination framework for fast frequency response from flexible loads and energy storage, bridging the gap between physical capability assessment and grid-operational utilization. The framework decomposes frequency support into multiple time-critical service layers based on response speed, power capacity, and energy sustainability, and dynamically allocates FFR responsibilities among heterogeneous resources accordingly. By explicitly accounting for response latency, saturation limits, and energy constraints, the proposed approach enables coordinated dispatch that prioritizes ultra-fast resources for initial frequency arrest while leveraging slower but energy-rich resources to sustain recovery.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Influence of Residential Electric Vehicle Charging on Distribution System Hosting Capacity -- A Case-Study in Arizona</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Golgol, Anamitra Pal, Vijay Vittal, Christine Fini, Ernest Palomino, Kyle Girardi</p>
            <p>The installation of high-capacity fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) is posing a significant risk to the distribution grid as the increased demand from widespread residential EV charging could exceed the technical limits of the distribution system. Addressing this issue is critical, given that current infrastructure upgrades to enhance EV hosting capacity are both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the inherent uncertainties associated with EV charging parameters make it challenging for power utilities to accurately assess the impact of EVs added to specific locations. To address these knowledge gaps, this study (a) introduces an algorithm to coordinate residential EV charging, and (b) proposes a comprehensive framework that evaluates all transformers within a feeder. The proposed method is applied to a real-world feeder, which includes 120 transformers of varying capacities. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively manages a substantial number of EVs without overloading any of the transformers, while also pinpointing locations that must be prioritized for future upgrades. This framework can serve as a valuable reference for utilities when conducting distribution system evaluations for supporting the growing EV penetration.</p>

            <h2>Missing Money and Market-Based Adequacy in Deeply Decarbonized Power Systems with Long-Duration Energy Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Suski, Elina Spyrou, Richard Green</p>
            <p>The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaun Sweeney, Robert Shorten, Mark O'Malley</p>
            <p>This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics.

In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes. The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule. Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage.

            <h2>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Passos</p>
            <p>In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</p>

            <h2>Fast Frequency Response Potential of Data Centers through Workload Modulation and UPS Coordination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced system inertia and increased the need for fast frequency response (FFR) in modern power systems. Data centers, as large and flexible electrical consumers, hold great potential to contribute to frequency stabilization due to their controllable IT workloads and on-site uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging data centers for providing fast frequency response through real-time workload modulation and UPS coordination. A dynamic model combining data center power consumption and grid frequency dynamics is developed, capturing the interactions between IT servers, cooling systems, and energy storage. Control strategies based on frequency deviation are implemented to adjust server power and discharge UPS batteries during frequency events. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce frequency nadir and shorten recovery time without compromising service quality. The results highlight the promising role of data centers as grid-supporting resources in future low-inertia systems.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Fast Frequency Response from Electric Vehicles, Data Centers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh</p>
            <p>High renewable penetration has significantly reduced system inertia in modern power grids, increasing the need for fast frequency response (FFR) from distributed and non-traditional resources. While electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have each demonstrated the capability to provide sub-second active power support, their combined frequency response potential has not been systematically evaluated. This paper proposes a coordinated control framework that aggregates these heterogeneous resources to provide fast, stable, and reliable FFR. Dynamic models for EV fleets, data center UPS and workload modulation, and BESS are developed, explicitly capturing their response times, power limits, and operational constraints. A hierarchical control architecture is introduced, where an upper-level coordinator dynamically allocates FFR among resources based on response speed and available capacity, and lower-level controllers implement the actual power response. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the coordinated EV-DC-BESS framework improves frequency nadir by up to 0.2 Hz, reduces RoCoF, and accelerates frequency recovery compared with single-resource FFR. Results confirm that synergistic coordination significantly enhances grid stability, especially in low-inertia scenarios. This work highlights the value of multi-resource aggregation for future frequency regulation markets in renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <p>We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\Delta$ are provided.

            <h2>On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez</p>
            <p>Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Wang, Junwei Liu, Jialin Zheng, Yangbin Zeng, Di Mou, Zian Qin</p>
            <p>Multi-active bridge (MAB) converters, the core of the state-of-the-art medium-voltage power electronic transformers, can flexibly connect multiple DC ports among distributed DC grids and loads, but suffer from hard switching under conventional single phase-shift control, especially under unbalanced voltage conversion ratios and light load conditions. Although some offline methods manage to improve the efficiency through complex optimization structures, there lacks online optimization methods that are simple but effective due to the strong coupling among ports of the converter. By leveraging the time-domain model of the MAB converter under the multiple phase-shift modulation scheme, this paper simplifies the optimization process and proposes an online optimization method that can achieve full zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation regardless of the load conditions. The proposed method has simple solutions with only voltage conversion ratios involved and can be implemented within a wide operation range without additional sensors or advanced controllers. A four-port MAB converter is constructed as the prototype. The simulation and experimental results have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed online strategy in achieving ZVS operation, dynamic response, and efficiency improvement.</p>

            <p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy for power electronics, but it highly relies on manually-derived and topology-specific analytical models, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming in practical designs. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper introduces a Digital-Twin-based MPC (DT-MPC) framework for generic power converters that can systematically translate a high-level circuit into an objective-aware control policy by leveraging a DT as a high-fidelity system model. Furthermore, a physics-informed neural surrogate predictor is proposed to accelerate predictions by DT and enable real-time operation. A gradient-free simplex search optimizer is also introduced to efficiently handle complex multi-objective optimization. The efficacy of the framework has been validated through a cloud-to-edge deployment on a 1500 W dual active bridge converter. Experimental results show that the synthesized predictive model achieves an inference speed over 7 times faster than real time, the DT-MPC controller outperforms several human-designed counterparts, and the overall framework reduces engineering design time by over 95\%, verifying the superiority of DT-MPC on generalized power converters.</p>

            <p>Growing EV adoption can worsen traffic conditions if chargers are sited without regard to their impact on congestion. We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minghao Mou, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Transportation electrification introduces strong coupling between the power and transportation systems. In this paper, we generalize the classical notion of Braess' paradox to coupled power and transportation systems, and examine how the cross-system coupling induces new types of Braess' paradoxes. To this end, we model the power and transportation networks as graphs, coupled with charging points connecting to nodes in both graphs. The power system operation is characterized by the economic dispatch optimization, while the transportation system user equilibrium models travelers' route and charging choices. By analyzing simple coupled systems, we demonstrate that capacity expansion in either transportation or power system can deteriorate the performance of both systems, and uncover the fundamental mechanisms for such new Braess' paradoxes to occur. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the occurrences of Braess' paradoxes for general coupled systems, leading to managerial insights for infrastructure planners. For general networks, through characterizing the generalized user equilibrium of the coupled systems, we develop efficient algorithms to detect Braess' paradoxes and novel charging pricing policies to mitigate them.</p>

            <p>The transition to electric transportation is a key enabler for intelligent and sustainable cities; however, inadequate charging infrastructure remains a major barrier to large-scale electric vehicle (EV) adoption. This paper presents a scalable Electric Road System (ERS) architecture that enables Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC) of EVs during motion. The proposed framework integrates inductive charging coils embedded in road pavement, real-time vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, and adaptive energy management coordinated with smart grid systems. Modular road segments with a standardized charging process are employed to ensure scalability across urban corridors and interoperability among different EV platforms. System performance is evaluated using a co-simulation framework combining MATLAB-based power analysis with traffic inputs generated in SUMO. Key performance metrics include charging efficiency, energy cost per kilometer, and battery lifecycle improvement. Simulation results indicate a potential reduction in range anxiety and an increase in battery lifespan due to frequent shallow charging cycles. The study further discusses deployment challenges, policy considerations, and energy distribution strategies aligned with climate-resilient urban development. A case study of a tier-1 Indian city is presented to analyze the cost-benefit trade-offs of retrofitting high-density urban corridors with ERS. The proposed framework provides a practical foundation for next-generation EV infrastructure planning in smart cities.</p>

            <p>Mid-band extra-large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), emerging as a critical enabler for future communication systems, is expected to deliver significantly higher throughput by leveraging the extended bandwidth and enlarged antenna aperture. However, power consumption remains a significant concern due to the enlarged system dimension, underscoring the need for thorough investigations into efficient system design and deployment. To this end, an in-depth study is conducted on mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, a comprehensive power consumption model is proposed, encompassing the power consumption of major hardware components and signal processing procedures, while capturing the influence of key system parameters. Considering typical near-field propagation characteristics, closed-form approximations of throughput are derived, providing an analytical framework for assessing energy efficiency (EE). Based on the proposed framework, the scaling law of EE with respect to key system configurations is derived, offering valuable insights for system design. Subsequently, extensions and comparisons are conducted among representative multi-antenna technologies, demonstrating the superiority of mid-band XL-MIMO in EE. Extensive numerical results not only verify the tightness of the throughput analysis but also validate the EE evaluations, unveiling the potential of energy-efficient mid-band XL-MIMO systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingwei Cao, Yan Xu</p>
            <p>High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.</p>

            <p>This comprehensive literature review examines the emerging applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in power system engineering. Through a systematic analysis of recent research published between 2020 and 2025, we explore how LLMs are being integrated into various aspects of power system operations, planning, and management. The review covers key application areas including fault diagnosis, load forecasting, cybersecurity, control and optimization, system planning, simulation, and knowledge management. Our findings indicate that while LLMs show promising potential in enhancing power system operations through their advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities, significant challenges remain in their practical implementation. These challenges include limited domain-specific training data, concerns about reliability and safety in critical infrastructure, and the need for enhanced explainability. The review also highlights emerging trends such as the development of power system-specific LLMs and hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional power engineering methods. We identify crucial research directions for advancing the field, including the development of specialized architectures, improved security frameworks, and enhanced integration with existing power system tools. This survey provides power system researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM applications in the field and outlines future pathways for research and development.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Ellemund, Thomas Hübner, Quentin Lété, Stefano Bracco, Matteo Fresia, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Bidding flexibility in day-ahead and intraday auctions would enable decentralized flexible resources, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, to efficiently align their consumption with the intermittent generation of renewable energy. However, because these resources are individually too small to participate in those auctions directly, an aggregator (e.g., a utility) must act on their behalf. This requires aggregating many decentralized resources, which is a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient and highly accurate method that is readily applicable to European day-ahead and intraday auctions. Distinct from existing methods, we aggregate only economically relevant power profiles, identified through price forecasts. The resulting flexibility is then conveyed to the market operator via exclusive groups of block bids. We evaluate our method for a utility serving the Swiss town of Losone, where flexibility from multiple heat pumps distributed across the grid must be aggregated and bid in the Swiss day-ahead auction. Results show that our method aggregates accurately, achieving 98% of the theoretically possible cost savings. This aggregation accuracy remains stable even as the number of heat pumps increases, while computation time grows only linearly, demonstrating strong scalability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudolf Reiter, Chao Qin, Leonard Bauersfeld, Davide Scaramuzza</p>
            <p>Many aerial tasks involving quadrotors demand both instant reactivity and long-horizon planning. High-fidelity models enable accurate control but are too slow for long horizons; low-fidelity planners scale but degrade closed-loop performance. We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon.

            <h2>Can Carbon-Aware Electric Load Shifting Reduce Emissions? An Equilibrium-Based Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Olivier Huber, Michael C. Ferris, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing number of electric loads, such as hydrogen producers or data centers, can be characterized as carbon-sensitive, meaning that they are willing to adapt the timing and/or location of their electricity usage in order to minimize carbon footprints. However, the emission reduction efforts of these carbon-sensitive loads rely on carbon intensity information such as average carbon emissions, and it is unclear whether load shifting based on these signals effectively reduces carbon emissions. To address this open question, we design a carbon-aware equilibrium model, which expands the commonly used equilibrium model for standard (carbon-agnostic) electricity market clearing to include carbon-sensitive consumers that adapt their consumption based on average carbon emission signals and carbon costs. This analysis represents an idealized situation for carbon-sensitive consumers, where their carbon preferences are reflected directly in the market clearing, and contrasts with current practice, where carbon emission signals only become known to consumers a posteriori (i.e., after the market has already been cleared). Furthermore, we extend our model to consider temporal load shifting and time-varying maximum renewable generations. We employ illustrative three-bus examples and numerical simulations on the IEEE RTS-GMLC system to reveal the limitations of the widely adopted average carbon emission signal for guiding carbon emission reduction. Our model offers a novel perspective for evaluating the effectiveness of different carbon signals and contributes to new carbon signal design.</p>

            <h2>SpectrumFM: A Foundation Model for Intelligent Spectrum Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuhui Zhou, Chunyu Liu, Hao Zhang, Wei Wu, Qihui Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek, Chan-Byoung Chae</p>
            <p>Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <h2>Controlled Evolution-Based Day-Ahead Robust Dispatch Considering Frequency Security with Frequency Regulation Loads and Curtailable Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Kang, Xiaoyu Peng, Kui Luo, Xi Ru, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>With the extensive integration of volatile and uncertain renewable energy, power systems face significant challenges in primary frequency regulation due to instantaneous power fluctuations. However, the maximum frequency deviation constraint is inherently non-convex, and commonly used two-stage dispatch methods overlook causality, potentially resulting in infeasible day-ahead decisions. This paper presents a controlled evolution-based day-ahead robust dispatch method to address these issues. First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability. Additionally, a novel controlled evolution-based algorithm is developed to solve this framework efficiently. Case studies on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in enhancing frequency security and system reliability.</p>

            <h2>Source Localization and Power Estimation through RISs: Performance Analysis and Prototype Validations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuhai Wang, Tiebin Mi, Chun Wang, Rujing Xiong, Zhengyu Wang, Robert Caiming Qiu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the capabilities and effectiveness of backward localization centered on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive--via rank analysis--the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds.</p>

            <p>Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling full-space signal manipulation and enhancing wireless network coverage and capacity. In this article, we present a comprehensive analytical comparison of STAR-RIS-assisted systems with single-input single-output (SISO), conventional RISs, and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying schemes, including both half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) modes. Closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable secrecy rates of STAR-RIS-aided communications under both the absence and presence of eavesdroppers. Unlike most existing works, the direct source destination link is incorporated in all considered schemes, and optimal transmit power allocation is investigated for HD and FD-DF relaying. Furthermore, we provide the conditions under which STAR-RIS outperforms HD- and FD-DF relaying and quantify the minimum number of STAR-RIS elements required to achieve superior rates. The impacts of key system parameters including transmit power, number of elements, reflection-to-transmission power ratio, element-splitting factor, and deployment positions on both achievable and secrecy performance are investigated. The results reveal that STAR-RIS systems can achieve superior rates and secrecy rates compared to all benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p>The maritime sector is undergoing a disruptive technological change driven by three main factors: autonomy, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations. This paper presents the design and development of a decision support system for ferry operations based on a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance. This enables enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining predefined maneuver durations. The findings suggest that optimal control applications hold substantial promise for advancing future ferry operations on inland waters.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxuan Li, Yilong Chen, Fan Liu, Jie Xu</p>
            <p>This letter addresses the joint air corridor planning and base station (BS) deployment problem for low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunzhe Zhu, Xuewen Liao, Zhenzhen Gao, Linzhou Zeng, Yong Zeng</p>
            <p>The ability to construct channel knowledge map (CKM) with high precision is essential for environment awareness in 6G wireless systems. However, most existing CKM construction methods formulate the task as an image super-resolution or generation problem, thereby employing models originally developed for computer vision. As a result, the generated CKMs often fail to capture the underlying physical characteristics of wireless propagation. In this paper, considering that acquiring channel observations incurs non-negligible time and cost, we focus on constructing CKM for large-scale fading scenarios without relying on prior observations, and we design three physics-based constraints to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of large-scale fading. By integrating these physical constraints with state-of-the-art diffusion model that possesses superior generative capability, a physics-inspired diffusion model for CKM construction is proposed. Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Chong Ma, Yuanzheng Li, Sen Li, Yanbo Chen, Zhaoyang Dong</p>
            <p>Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Zelaya-Arrazabal, Sebastian Martinez-Lizana, Hector Pulgar-Painemal, Jin Zhao</p>
            <p>This paper presents a hybrid model-AI framework for real-time dynamic security assessment of frequency stability in power systems. The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches.</p>

            <h2>Impact and Mitigation of Current Saturation Algorithms in Grid-Forming Inverters on Power Swing Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs) are widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, and are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. The corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory. To mitigate this issue, an optimal current saturation strategy is proposed. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p>

We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Frequency and Voltage Strength in Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems Based on Eigen-subsystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huisheng Gao, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Zhiyi Li, Ping Ju</p>
            <p>The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.</p>

            <p>In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.</p>

            <p>The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor (CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Seung Ko, Jae Woong Shim, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)-based control framework that enables comprehensive power smoothing for hyperscale AI datacenters with large load variations. Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Miller, Petros Karamanakos, Tobias Geyer</p>
            <p>Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation technique in which a switching signal is computed offline through an optimization process that accounts for selected performance criteria, such as current harmonic distortion. The optimization determines both the switching angles (i.e., switching times) and the pattern structure (i.e., the sequence of voltage levels). This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs</p>

            <h2>High-performance computing enabled contingency analysis for modern power networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Gracia-Calvo, Francesca Rossi, Eduardo Iraola, Juan Carlos Olives-Camps, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo</p>
            <p>Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments.</p>

            <h2>Saturation-based robustly optimal hierarchical operation control of microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ujjwal Pratap, Steffen Hofmann</p>
            <p>This paper studies the problem of robustly optimal operation control of microgrids with a high share of renewable energy sources. The main goal is to ensure optimal operation under a wide range of circumstances, given the highly intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable sources and load demand. We formally state this problem, and, in order to solve it, we make effective use of the hierarchical power system control approach. We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy. We prove that this enables the use of constant power setpoints to achieve optimal operation under certain conditions. In order to relax these conditions, the approach is combined with an energy management system, which solves a robust unit commitment problem within a model predictive control framework. Finally, a case study demonstrates the viability of the control design.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Transmission Switching and Busbar Splitting in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Bastianel, Marta Vanin, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun</p>
            <p>Driven by global climate goals, an increasing amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is currently being installed worldwide. Especially in the context of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most effective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid AC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and meshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited literature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the total power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed. The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.</p>

            <p>This article investigates on the improvement and stabilization of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) output voltages in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a vertical-axis tidal turbine using advanced control strategies. The research integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to enhance voltage stability and efficiency. Initially, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach based on Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy logic controllers is explored. To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers. The hybrid ANN-PSO technique improves the voltage regulation by dynamically adapting to system variations and providing real-time reference speed adjustments. This research highlights the AI-based hybrid optimization benefit to stabilize the output voltage of tidal energy systems, thereby increasing reliability and efficiency in renewable energy applications.</p>

            <p>Shading faults remain one of the most critical challenges affecting photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, as they not only reduce power generation but also disturb maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\&O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and clarifying a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies indicating speedup opportunities, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that quantum algorithms, including their gate-level realizations, can benefit from the design intuition applied in communication engineering.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Hsiang Shen</p>
            <p>This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.</p>

            <h2>Online Energy Storage Arbitrage under Imperfect Predictions: A Conformal Risk-Aware Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqian Wu, Ming Yi, Bolun Xu, James Anderson</p>
            <p>This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risk arising from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Neural Approximations for Bilevel Adversarial Problems in Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Harsha Nagarajan, Deepjyoti Deka, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>The adversarial worst-case load shedding (AWLS) problem is pivotal for identifying critical contingencies under line outages. It is naturally cast as a bilevel program: the upper level simulates an attacker determining worst-case line failures, and the lower level corresponds to the defender's generator redispatch operations. Conventional techniques using optimality conditions render the bilevel, mixed-integer formulation computationally prohibitive due to the combinatorial number of topologies and the nonconvexity of AC power flow constraints. To address these challenges, we develop a novel single-level optimal value-function (OVF) reformulation and further leverage a data-driven neural network (NN) surrogate of the follower's optimal value. To ensure physical realizability, we embed the trained surrogate in a physics-constrained NN (PCNN) formulation that couples the OVF inequality with (relaxed) AC feasibility, yielding a mixed-integer convex model amenable to off-the-shelf solvers. To achieve scalability, we learn a sparse, area-partitioned NN via spectral clustering; the resulting block-sparse architecture scales essentially linearly with system size while preserving accuracy. Notably, our approach produces near-optimal worst-case failures and generalizes across loading conditions and unseen topologies, enabling rapid online recomputation. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems demonstrate the method's scalability and solution quality for large-scale contingency analysis, with an average optimality gap of 5.8% compared to conventional methods, while maintaining computation times under one minute.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Bai, Xinfeng Ru, Andreas A. Malikopoulos</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate cooperative platoon formation and benefit allocation in mixed-energy truck fleets composed of both electric and fuel-powered trucks. The central challenge arises from the platoon-size constraint, which limits the number of trucks permitted in each platoon and introduces combinatorial coupling into the search for optimal platoon formation structures. We formulate this problem as a coalitional game with bounded coalition sizes and derive a closed-form characterization of the optimal coalition structure that maximizes the fleet-wide platooning benefit. Building on this structure, we develop a type-based least-core payoff allocation scheme that guarantees stability within the coalition-structure core (CS-core). For cases in which the CS-core is empty, we compute the least-core radius to determine the minimal relaxation required to achieve approximate stability. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves the highest total platooning benefit among all feasible formation configurations while providing stable benefit allocations that outperform existing baseline methods.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</p>

            <h2>From Forecast to Action: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Power Outages During Tropical Cyclones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongchuan Yang, Naiyu Wang, Zhenguo Wang, Min Ouyang, Can Wan</p>
            <p>Power outages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) pose serious risks to electric power systems and the communities they serve. Accurate, high-resolution outage forecasting is essential for enabling both proactive mitigation planning and real-time emergency response. This study introduces the SpatioTemporal Outage ForeCAST (STO-CAST) model, a deep learning framework developed for real-time, regional-scale outage prediction during TC events with high-resolution outputs in both space and time. STO-CAST integrates static environmental and infrastructure attributes with dynamic meteorological and outage sequences using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully connected layers, and is trained via a Leave-One-Storm-Out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy along with holdout grid experiments to demonstrate its preliminary generalization capability to unseen storms and grids. The model produces hourly outage forecasts at a 4 km * 4 km resolution and supports dual forecasting modes: short-term nowcasting with a 6-hour lead time via assimilation of real-time observations, and long-term forecasting with a 60-hour lead time based on evolving meteorological projections. A case study on Typhoon Muifa (2022) demonstrates STO-CAST's operational effectiveness, including error decomposition across model design, meteorological uncertainty, and observation gaps, while highlighting the value of real-time data assimilation and the model's capacity to identify evolving outage hotspots. STO-CAST offers a scalable, data-driven solution to support risk-informed emergency response and enhance power system resilience under intensifying TC threats.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we first clarify the concepts of green AI versus frugal AI, positioning frugality as efficiency by design and green AI as transparency and accountability. We then argue that these approaches, while complementary, are insufficient without a shared quantitative foundation that links AI computing to power system contexts. This motivates the development of standardized carbon metrics as a bridge between algorithmic decisions and their physical consequences. We next embed these signals into scheduling and planning frameworks, presenting two architectures: (i) an iterative signal-response loop for real-time operations, and (ii) an integrated optimization that learns and encodes flexible-load behavior for long-term planning. Finally, we show how the same coordination stack supports resilience, enabling signals to shift from emissions-first to stability-first during stress events, providing targeted relief and faster restoration.</p>

By evaluating frontier VLMs on both synthetic and real-world image-data pairs, this paper establishes a performance baseline attained by current FLMs. In addition, this paper presents empirical results suggesting that test time scaling or parameter scaling alone does not lead to improved joint angle predictions.</p>

            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad H. Dinan, Khatereh Nadali, Mark F. Flanagan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted generalized receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-GRQSM) scheme to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of RIS-aided \textit{quadrature} spatial modulation (QSM) systems. By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.</p>

However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art. Video: this https URL</p>

The application of this methodology simplifies establishing the link between impedance matrix terms and closed-loop stability properties. Moreover, Pauli decomposition transforms impedance matrices in a quaternion-like form that is helpful to assess the root cause of instabilities. The theoretical contributions are validated using a case study consisting of a power electronic converter connected to a weak grid that has been previously analysed in the literature using existing techniques.</p>

            <p>The increasing electric power consumption and the shift towards renewable energy resources demand for new ways to operate transmission and subtransmission grids. Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a feedback real-time control method that can be employed to enable optimal operation of these grids. Such controllers can maximize grid efficiency (e.g., minimizing curtailment) while satisfying grid constraints like voltage and current limits. The OFO control method is tailored and extended to handle discrete inputs and it is explained how to design an OFO controller for the subtransmission grid. A novel benchmark is presented and published that corresponds to the real French subtransmission grid on which the proposed controller is analyzed in terms of robustness against model mismatch, constraint satisfaction, and tracking performance. It is shown that OFO controllers can help utilize the grid to its full extent, virtually reinforce it, and operate it optimally and in real-time by using the flexibility offered by renewable generators connected to distribution grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjian Tuo, Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>Day-ahead generation scheduling is typically conducted by solv-ing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, with fast-growing of inverter-based resources, grid inertia has been dramatically reduced, compromising the dy-namic stability system. Traditional SCUC (T-SCUC), without any inertia requirements, may no longer be effective for renewa-bles-dominated grids. To address this, we propose the active linearized sparse neural network-embedded SCUC (ALSNN-SCUC) model, utilizing machine learning (ML) to incorporate system dynamic performance. A multi-output deep neural net-work (DNN) model is trained offline on strategically-selected data samples to accurately predict frequency stability metrics: locational RoCoF and frequency nadir. Structured sparsity and active ReLU linearization are implemented to prune redundant DNN neurons, significantly reducing its size while ensuring pre-diction accuracy even at high sparsity levels. By embedding this ML-based frequency stability predictor into SCUC as con-straints, the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model minimizes its com-putational complexity while ensuring frequency stability follow-ing G-1 contingency. Case studies show that the proposed ALSNN-SCUC can enforce pre-specified frequency requirements without being overly conservative, outperforming five bench-mark models including T-SCUC, two physics-based SCUC, and two ML-based SCUC. The proposed sparsification and active linearization strategies can reduce the DNN-SCUC computing time by over 95% for both IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Scheduling for High Renewables-Integrated Energy Systems with Battery Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunzhi Zhao, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>In high renewables-integrated power systems, irrespective to their sizes, energy storage is commonly included and utilized to mitigate fluctuations from both the load and renewable power generation, ensuring system reliability, among which battery energy storage system (BESS) are experiencing fast-growth in recent years. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithi-um-ion batteries, have been extensively deployed. The degrada-tion of these batteries significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately quantify the battery degrada-tion; however, the model complexity hinders their applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different scales. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach, in-troducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery deg-radation model (SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the scheduled BESS operational profiles. This approach achieves accurate degradation prediction while substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network model. The computational burden of day-ahead energy scheduling when integrating battery degradation can thus be substantially alleviated. Case studies, conducted on both small-scale microgrids and large-scale bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency and suitability of the proposed optimal energy scheduling model that can effectively address battery degrada-tion concerns while optimizing day-ahead energy scheduling op-erations.</p>

            <h2>Generation Expansion Planning with Upstream Supply Chain Constraints on Materials, Manufacturing, and Deployment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyu Yao, Andrey Bernstein, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Embedded Dynamic Security Control using Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Masoumi, Mert Korkali</p>
            <p>Dynamic security control (DSC) is considered a pivotal step for the future power grid, which is increasingly penetrated by inverter-based resources. However, the efficiency of such practices, whether governed by automatic generation control or virtual inertia scheduling, can be intractable due to the complexity of the problem and the need to solve the differentialalgebraic equation in a timely manner with the required accuracy. In this regard, the model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates reliable performance. In addition, the introduction of fault-tolerant and near-term quantum computing terminologies, i.e., noisy intermediate-scale quantum, opens avenues for improving the performance of model-free algorithms leveraging quantum capabilities. This paper provides an organized framework and assesses its dependability by evaluating the performance of a quantum-embedded algorithm on the DSC of the IEEE 39-bus test system. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate promising applications, along with shortcomings that can be addressed and further developed later.</p>

            <h2>PINN vs LSTM: A Comparative Study for Steam Temperature Control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mojtaba Fanoodi, Farzaneh Abdollahi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a direct comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for adaptive steam temperature control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs), particularly under valve leakage faults. Maintaining precise steam temperature in HRSGs is critical for efficiency and safety, yet traditional control strategies struggle with nonlinear, fault-induced dynamics. Both architectures are designed to adaptively tune the gains of a PI-plus-feedforward control law in real-time. The LSTM controller, a purely data-driven approach, was trained offline on historical operational data, while the PINN controller integrates fundamental thermodynamic laws directly into its online learning process through a physics-based loss function. Their performance was evaluated using a model validated with data from a combined cycle power plant, under normal load changes and a challenging valve leakage fault scenario. Results demonstrate that while the LSTM controller offers significant improvement over conventional methods, its performance degrades under the unseen fault. The PINN controller consistently delivered superior robustness and performance, achieving a 54\% reduction in integral absolute error compared to the LSTM under fault conditions. This study concludes that embedding physical knowledge into data-driven control is essential for developing reliable, fault-tolerant autonomous control systems in complex industrial applications.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Vladimir Dvorkin, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Masoumi, Mert Korkali</p>
            <p>In modern power systems, frequency regulation is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring system reliability and assessing the robustness of expansion projects. Conventional feedback control schemes, however, exhibit limited accuracy under varying operating conditions because their gains remain static. Consequently, deep reinforcement learning methods are increasingly employed to design adaptive controllers that can be generalized to diverse frequency control tasks. At the same time, recent advances in quantum computing provide avenues for embedding quantum capabilities into such critical applications. In particular, the potential of quantum algorithms can be more effectively explored and harnessed on near-term quantum devices by leveraging insights from active controller design. In this work, we incorporate a quantum circuit together with an ansatz into the operation of a deep deterministic policy gradient agent. The simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach that can achieve reliable, robust performance across diverse real-world challenges.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing DER Aggregate Flexibility via Network Reconfiguration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feixiang Zhang, Hongyi Li, Bai Cui, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Fritz, Waqquas Bukhsh</p>
            <p>Enhanced computational capabilities of modern decision-making software have allowed us to solve increasingly sophisticated optimisation problems. But in complex socio-economic, technical environments such as electricity markets, transparent operation is key to ensure a fair treatment of all parties involved, particularly regarding dispatch decisions. We address this issue by building on the concept of counterfactual explanations, answering questions such as "Why was this generator not dispatched?" by identifying minimum changes in the input parameters that would have changed the optimal solution. Both DC Optimal Power Flow and Unit Commitment problems are considered, wherein the variable parameters are the spatial and temporal demand profiles, respectively. The thereby obtained explanations allow users to identify the most important differences between the real and expected market outcomes and observe which constraints have led to the solution. The framework uses a bilevel optimisation problem to find the counterfactual demand scenarios. State-of-the-art methods are compared with data-driven heuristics on the basis of computational efficiency and explanation accuracy. Results show that leveraging historical data from previously solved instances can provide significant speed benefits and allows us to derive explanations in cases where conventional methods would not be tractable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Rossi, Juan Carlos Olives-Camps, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt</p>
            <p>This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</p>

            <h2>Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maoyuan Ma, Wangyi Guo, Lei Yang, Zhanbo Xu, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.</p>

            <p>Industrial installations across several sectors have seen a dramatic increase in productivity, accuracy and efficiency over the last decade due to expanded utilization of medium voltage, variable speed power electronic converters to drive their processes. Specifically, active front-end (AFE) drives have become popular due to their ability to deliver power while maintaining safe electrical setpoints. However, under abnormal grid conditions such as phase loss, conventional AFE control may fail to enforce safety constraints, potentially leading to drive shutdown and significant financial losses. In this work, we propose using reference-tracking Performance Boosting (rPB) to improve the resilience of standard AFE control to faults. This neural-network control framework provides a principled way to optimize transient performance while preserving the steady-state tracking properties of AFE-based drives. By carefully shaping the input signals to the rPB controller, we ensure that it activates only during grid faults, leaving nominal operation unaffected. Simulation results show that the proposed approach successfully maintains the DC bus voltage and the grid current within safe limits during single-phase loss events.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a hybrid Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) framework for solving the unbalanced three-phase AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. The method combines a fixed McCormick outer approximation of bilinear voltage-current terms, first-order Taylor linearisations, and an adaptive trust-region constraint to preserve feasibility and promote convergence. The resulting formulation remains convex at each iteration and ensures convergence to a stationary point that satisfies the first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the nonlinear OPF. Case studies on standard IEEE feeders and a real low-voltage (LV) network in Cyprus demonstrate high numerical accuracy with optimality gap below 0.1% and up to 2x faster runtimes compared to IPOPT. These results confirm that the method is accurate and computationally efficient for large-scale unbalanced distribution networks.</p>

            <p>The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm for future wireless systems due to spectrum reuse, hardware sharing, and joint waveform design. In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant control framework for steam temperature regulation in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) subject to actuator faults. Addressing the critical challenge of valve degradation in superheater spray attemperators, we propose a synergistic architecture comprising three components: (1) a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of unmeasured thermal states, (2) a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for estimating multiplicative actuator faults using physical laws as constraints, and (3) a one-sided Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that adapts to the estimated faults while minimizing excessive actuation. The key innovation lies in the framework of closed-loop physics-awareness, where the PINN continuously informs both the observer and controller about fault severity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. Rigorous uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) is established via Lyapunov analysis under practical assumptions. Validated on real HRSG operational data, the framework demonstrates effective fault adaptation, reduced temperature overshoot, and maintains steam temperature within 1°C of the setpoint under valve effectiveness loss. This work bridges control theory and physics-guided machine learning to deliver a practically deployable solution for power plant resilience, with extensions applicable to thermal systems subject to multiplicative faults.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Jamróz, Rafał Kucharski, David Watling</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities.</p>

            <p>This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory, along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue, we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches over benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p>Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner, delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates, without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.</p>

Conventional wireless methods, however, often face limitations in accuracy, reliability, and coverage, especially in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing. To validate the theoretical concepts in real-world conditions, recent experimental results using an RIS prototype are detailed, showcasing the technology's efficacy and illustrating key performance trade-offs.</p>

            <h2>DySTAN: Joint Modeling of Sedentary Activity and Social Context from Smartphone Sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Sneh, Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Snehil Gupta, Haroon R. Lone</p>
            <p>Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.</p>

            <h2>Hardware Distortion Aware Precoding for ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murat Babek Salman, Emil Björnson, Özlem Tugfe Demir</p>
            <p>The impact of hardware impairments on the spectral efficiency of communication systems is well studied, but their effect on sensing performance remains unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the influence of hardware impairments on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in cluttered environments. We derive the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) and show that hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, which masks target echoes. The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming hardware- and clutter-induced limitations, demonstrating significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.</p>

            <h2>Fleet Size and Mix Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Mobile Fast Chargers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhang Motallebi Araghi, Armin Abdolmohammdi, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari</p>
            <p>The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging.</p>

            <h2>Modal Analysis of Core Inertial Dynamics: Re-evaluating Grid-Forming Control Design Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerardo Medrano, Santiago Cóbreces</p>
            <p>This paper employs modal analysis to study the core inertial dynamics of governor-controlled synchronous generators (GC-SG), droop-based grid-forming (GFM) converters, and their most fundamental interactions. The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements.</p>

            <h2>Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems with Applications to Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often (i) computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or (ii) infeasible due to the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP) to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We remark that the application of our proposed approach is limited to the class of SOF controllers in perturbed linear systems. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Moreover, such extensive numerical simulations corroborate that although we utilize a heuristic optimization method to compute the MDRP, it performs quite well in practice compared to an existing approximation method in the literature, namely the hybrid expansion-contraction (HEC) method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of multi-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the traditional SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less computational time.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Efficient Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Systems over Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenchao Liu, Xuhui Zhang, Chunjie Wang, Jinke Ren, Zheng Xing, Bo Yang, Shuqiang Wang, Yanyan Shen</p>
            <p>With the development of artificial intelligence integrated next-generation communication networks, mobile users (MUs) are increasingly demanding the efficient processing of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs. Fortunately, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) supported mobile edge computing (MEC) is regarded as an effective solution, offering the MUs multi-tier and efficient computing services. In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Zafari, Rang Liu, A. Lee Swindlehurst</p>
            <p>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS). The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free architectures.</p>

            <h2>Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala, Lei Wu, Panos J. Antsaklis</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a dissipativity-based framework for the joint design of distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs), providing robust performance guarantees for voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing across distributed generators (DGs). The closed-loop AC MG is represented as a networked system in which DGs, distribution lines, and loads function as interconnected subsystems linked through cyber-physical networks. Each DG utilizes a three-layer hierarchical control structure: a steady-state controller for operating point configuration, a local feedback controller for voltage tracking, and a distributed droop-free controller implementing normalized power consensus for frequency coordination and proportional power distribution. The operating point design is formulated as an optimization problem. Leveraging dissipativity theory, we derive necessary and sufficient subsystem dissipativity conditions. The global co-design is then cast as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization that jointly determines distributed controller parameters and sparse communication architecture while managing the highly nonlinear, coupled dq-frame dynamics characteristic of AC systems.</p>

            <h2>Polynomial Order Selection for Savitzky-Golay Smoothers via N-fold Cross-Validation (extended version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cagatay Candan</p>
            <p>Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothers are noise suppressing filters operating on the principle of projecting noisy input onto the subspace of polynomials. A poorly selected polynomial order results in over- or under-smoothing which shows as either bias or excessive noise at the output. In this study, we apply the N-fold cross-validation technique (also known as leave-one-out cross-validation) for model order selection and show that the inherent analytical structure of the SG filtering problem, mainly its minimum norm formulation, enables an efficient and effective order selection solution. More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method. The suggested solution compares favorably with the state-of-the-art Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) rule in non-asymptotic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sample size regimes. MATLAB codes reproducing the numerical results are provided.</p>

            <h2>From Range Loss to Recovery - Cold Weather Challenges and Design Strategies for Commercial Electric Vehicle Fleets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Arpit Bohra, Karthik Saikumar</p>
            <p>The North American commercial electric vehicle (EV) sector is undergoing rapid expansion, with unit sales rising from 21,120 in 2022 to 36,491 in 2023 - a 73% increase, according to the International Energy Agency. However, this accelerating adoption brings emerging technical challenges. One critical concern is the impact of low to extreme winter temperatures (25 degree F to -25 degree F) on EV performance, including reduced energy efficiency and extended charging times. This paper presents a systematic analysis of commercial EV performance degradation under cold weather conditions and its broader implications on grid operations. Monte Carlo simulations, applied using real-world fleet parameters, indicate that approximately 200 MWh of additional daily energy demand may be required in the U.S. alone to offset efficiency losses during severe cold events. The resulting strain on an already stressed winter grid could exacerbate reliability risks. Moreover, increased harmonic distortion associated with cold weather charging behaviors has also been observed, raising concerns about power quality. To address these challenges, this study proposes two practical mitigation strategies: (1) a 'design-integrated safety' battery swapping station model operating in thermally controlled environments to significantly reduce charging downtime, and (2) a hybrid architecture combining roadside fast charging with depot-based deep charging to support continuous fleet utilization without compromising range. Together, these interventions provide a robust foundation for resilient commercial EV integration in cold climates, supporting fleet operators and utilities in managing seasonal performance variability.</p>

            <h2>Constraint-Aware Grid-Forming Control for Current Limiting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominic Groß</p>
            <p>This work develops a constraint-aware grid-forming (GFM) control that explicitly accounts for current limits and modulation limits within the GFM oscillator dynamics generating the GFM voltage reference (i.e., phase angle and magnitude). Broadly speaking, the voltage reference generated by the constraint-aware GFM control minimizes the deviation from conventional unconstrained GFM droop control, while respecting current and modulation limits. The resulting GFM control achieves fast current limiting while preserving transient stability, e.g., exhibiting infinite critical clearing time. To develop the control, we first characterize and analyze the set of converter voltages that do not result in constraint violations. Next, an efficient algorithm for projecting voltages onto the feasible set is developed. Subsequently, these results are used to restrict the dynamics of GFM droop control to the set of feasible voltages. Finally, detailed simulation studies and hardware experiments are used to illustrate and validate the response to short-circuit faults and phase jumps.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Constrained Neural Dynamics: A Unified Manifold Framework for Large-Scale Power Flow Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuezhi Liu</p>
            <p>Power flow analysis is a fundamental tool for power system analysis, planning, and operational control. Traditional Newton-Raphson methods suffer from limitations such as initial value sensitivity and low efficiency in batch computation, while existing deep learning-based power flow solvers mostly rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving of numerous cases and struggling to guarantee physical consistency. This paper proposes a neural physics power flow solving method based on manifold geometry and gradient flow, by describing the power flow equations as a constraint manifold, and constructing an energy function \(V(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})\|^2\) and gradient flow \(\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = -\nabla V(\mathbf{x})\), transforming power flow solving into an equilibrium point finding problem for dynamical systems. Neural networks are trained in an unsupervised manner by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true "end-to-end" physics-constrained learning.</p>

            <h2>Frequency-Dynamics-Aware Economic Dispatch with Optimal Grid-Forming Inverter Allocation and Reserved Power Headroom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) reduces system inertia, leading to frequency stability concerns, especially during synchronous generator (SG) outages. To maintain frequency dynamics within secure limits while ensuring economic efficiency, frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) is employed. However, existing studies either neglect the frequency support capability and allocation of grid-forming (GFM) IBRs or suffer from limited accuracy in representing frequency dynamics due to model simplifications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based FCOPF (DL-FCOPF) framework. A DL model is first developed as a predictor to accurately estimate frequency-related metrics: the required reserved headroom and allocation of GFM IBRs, the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir. After being trained with data obtained from electromagnetic transient simulations, the DL model is reformulated and incorporated into FCOPF. Case studies conducted on two test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the traditional OPF and linear FCOPF benchmarks, the DL-FCOPF can optimally coordinate SGs and IBRs with minimum cost, achieving desired frequency response, within an acceptable computing time. Further-more, sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify the most suit-able structure and linearization approach of the DL-based frequency predictor.</p>

            <p>Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating "trend-driven" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\sim3\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (this https URL). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiko Fias, Md Umar Hashmi, Geert Deconinck</p>
            <p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) generation and electric vehicle (EV) charging intro- duces significant uncertainty in electricity consumption patterns, particularly at the distribution level. This paper presents a comparative study for selecting metrics for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for net load profiles of residential, industrial, and office buildings under increased DER penetration. A variety of statistical metrics is evaluated for their usefulness in quantifying un- certainty, including, but not limited to, standard deviation, entropy, ramps, and distance metrics. The proposed metrics are classified into baseline-free, with baseline and error-based. These UQ metrics are evaluated for increased penetration of EV and PV. The results highlight suitable metrics to quantify uncertainty per consumer type and demonstrate how net load uncertainty is affected by EV and PV adoption. Additionally, it is observed that joint consideration of EV and PV can reduce overall uncertainty due to compensatory effects of EV charging and PV generation due to temporal alignment during the day. Uncertainty reduction is observed across all datasets and is most pronounced for the office building dataset.</p>

            <p>Real-world intelligence systems usually operate by combining offline learning and online adaptation with highly correlated and non-stationary system data or signals, which, however, has rarely been investigated theoretically in the literature. This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm. This two-stage framework, integrating offline learning with online adaptation, demonstrates superior prediction performances compared with either purely offline or online methods. Both theoretical guarantees and empirical studies are provided.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Procopio, Marco Esposito, Sara Raggiunto, Andrey Gizdov, Alberto Belli, Paola Pierleoni</p>
            <p>We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.</p>

            <p>The rapid evolution of edge computing has exposed fundamental limitations in traditional operating system and hypervisor architectures, particularly in managing heterogeneous platforms and meeting the constraints of limited resources. Existing solutions often rely on monolithic or layered combinations of hypervisors and guest OSes, which are difficult to tailor for the diverse and dynamic requirements of edge scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TenonOS, a demand-driven, self-generating, and lightweight operating system framework that fundamentally rethinks and reconstructs both the hypervisor and OS architectures. TenonOS introduces a novel LibOS-on-LibOS approach, in which both virtualization and OS functionalities are modularized into fine-grained, reusable micro-libraries. A dynamic orchestration engine composes these modules on demand to construct customized, application-specific runtime environments. At the core of TenonOS are two key components: Mortise, a minimal, modularized hypervisor, and Tenon, a real-time LibOS. Mortise provides low-overhead resource isolation, fast inter-VM communication, and manages the full lifecycle of Tenon instances - including on-demand creation, suspension, and termination - enabling TenonOS to flexibly adapt its runtime layout to workload variations. Tenon delivers deterministic scheduling and multi-process support for time-critical applications. Through this unified and modular architecture, TenonOS eliminates redundant layers, reduces system overhead, and enhances scalability, security, and maintainability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TenonOS achieves superior real-time scheduling (40.28% improvement), a compact memory footprint (361 KiB), and high adaptability to dynamic edge workloads, making it an ideal foundation for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge systems.</p>

            <p>Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) provides a rigorous framework for complex robotic tasks, yet existing methods often rely on accurate dynamics models or expensive online interactions. In this work, we address LTL-constrained control in a challenging offline, model-free setting, utilizing only fixed, task-agnostic datasets of fragmented trajectories. We propose SAGAS, a novel framework combining graph-assisted trajectory stitching with automata-guided planning. First, we construct a latent reachability graph from a learned temporal-distance representation. To bridge the semantic gap, we augment this graph with certified anchor nodes and probabilistic soft labels. We then translate the specification into a Büchi automaton and search the implicit product space to derive a cost-minimal prefix-suffix plan. Finally, a subgoal-conditioned low-level policy is deployed to execute these latent waypoints. Experiments on OGBench locomotion domains demonstrate that SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for diverse LTL tasks, effectively bridging the gap between fragmented offline data and complex logical constraints.</p>

            <h2>A Novel MDP Decomposition Framework for Scalable UAV Mission Planning in Complex and Uncertain Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Muzakkir Quamar, Ali Nasir, Sami ELFerik</p>
            <p>This paper presents a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission management in complex and uncertain environments. The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality. The proposed framework establishes a practical and robust foundation for scalable decision-making in real-time UAV mission execution.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Causal Foundation Model in Prescriptive Maintenance Framework for Optimizing Production Line OEE</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Saretzky, Lucas Andersen, Thomas Engel, Fazel Ansari</p>
            <p>The transition to prescriptive maintenance in manufacturing is critically constrained by a dependence on predictive models. These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a "what-if" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes.</p>

            <p>Continuous energy monitoring is essential for identifying potential savings and predicting the energy requirements of buildings. Energy meters are often located in underground spaces that are difficult to reach with wireless technology. This paper presents an experimental study comparing different Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technologies in terms of building penetration and radio coverage. The technologies Low Power Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN), Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Sigfox 0G and Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks (Wi-SUN) are evaluated experimentally. It also proposes a distributed hybrid IoT architecture that combines multiple LPWAN technologies using an abstraction layer to optimize cost and coverage. Communication is message-based using the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. It is implemented using the MQTT protocol. The abstraction layer decodes the proprietary binary data and converts it to a normalized JSON format.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian dynamic scheduling of multipurpose batch processes under incomplete look-ahead information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taicheng Zheng, Dan Li, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.</p>

            <p>This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control strategy for adaptive lighting regulation in controlled environments using a low-power microcontroller. A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Otman A. Basir</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations. We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Forootani, Mohammad Sadr, Danial Esmaeili Aliabadi, Daniela Thraen</p>
            <p>Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.</p>

            <h2>Value of Communication in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Pareto Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiping Luo, Bowen Li, Nikolaos Pappas</p>
            <p>Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tal Shuster, Eliya Nachmani</p>
            <p>Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.</p>

            <p>Combined effects of transient ionizing and electromagnetic pulse on vertical NPN bipolar transistor were experimentally investigated under pulsed X-ray irradiation. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments.</p>

            <h2>Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Alimohammadi, Samara Mayhoub, Sotiris Chatzimiltis, Mohammad Shojafar, Muhammad Nasir Mumtaz Bhutta</p>
            <p>Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</p>

            <p>Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are envisioned to enable autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments, where adversaries may act strategically to deceive or evade detection. These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.</p>

            <p>Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as efficient tools to address the safe navigation problem for robot applications. However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.</p>

            <p>Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.</p>

            <p>Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

            <p>In today's digital age, access to the Internet is essential, yet a significant digital divide exists, particularly in rural areas of developing nations. This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.</p>

We will take into account prior knowledge on system-theoretic properties of the system, in particular, controllability and stabilizability. For this, we extend the notion of universal inputs to incorporate prior knowledge on the system. An input is called universal for identification (resp., stabilization) if, when applied to any system complying with the prior knowledge, it results in data suitable for identification (resp., stabilization) regardless of the initial condition. We provide a full characterization of such universal inputs. In addition, we discuss online experiment design using prior knowledge, and we study cases where this approach results in the shortest possible experiment for identification and stabilization.</p>

In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost.

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.</p>

            <h2>Hidden Markov Models for Stock Market Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luigi Catello, Ludovica Ruggiero, Lucia Schiavone, Mario Valentino</p>
            <p>The stock market presents a challenging environment for accurately predicting future stock prices due to its intricate and ever-changing nature. However, the utilization of advanced methodologies can significantly enhance the precision of stock price predictions. One such method is Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs are statistical models that can be used to model the behavior of a partially observable system, making them suitable for modeling stock prices based on historical data. Accurate stock price predictions can help traders make better investment decisions, leading to increased profits. In this article, we trained and tested a Hidden Markov Model for the purpose of predicting a stock closing price based on its opening price and the preceding day's prices. The model's performance has been evaluated using two indicators: Mean Average Prediction Error (MAPE), which specifies the average accuracy of our model, and Directional Prediction Accuracy (DPA), a newly introduced indicator that accounts for the number of fractional change predictions that are correct in sign.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeke Zexi Hu, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen</p>
            <p>The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the foundational component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets, and it offers a favorable balance between model performance and efficiency, yielding higher-quality LFSR results with substantially lower demand for memory and computation. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linrui Dai, Rongzhao Zhang, Yongrui Yu, Xiaofan Zhang</p>
            <p>The recently emerging conditional diffusion models seem promising for mitigating the labor and expenses in building large 3D medical imaging datasets. However, previous studies on 3D CT generation primarily focus on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast and have yet to fully capitalize on the benefits of both semantic and textual conditions. In this paper, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework based on easily-acquired text prompts to generate anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; an anatomy-aware high-dynamic-range (HDR) autoencoder for high-fidelity feature extraction across varying intensity levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. Combined, these components enable data synthesis for segmentation tasks from only textual instructions. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.

            <h2>Characterizing Demand Response Capability of Thermostatically Controlled Loads with Reach and Hold Sets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mazen Elsaadany, Hamid R. Ossareh, Mads R. Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners, offer valuable flexibility to the power grid. The aggregate power consumption of a TCL fleet can be controlled by adjusting thermostat setpoints. An ex-ante quantification of the flexibility that results from such setpoint change can inform grid operator decisions. This paper develops a rigorous, yet practical method to quantify flexibility in terms of the `reach-and-hold' set of TCL aggregations, which defines how much power can be shifted (reach) and for how long (hold). To quantify the reach-and-hold set, we employ a Markov-chain-based model of the TCL aggregation that captures second-order TCL dynamics, enabling accurate characterization of reach-and-hold sets. A tractable optimization problem is then formulated to numerically compute an inner approximation of these sets. Simulation results validate that our method accurately characterizes the fleet's flexibility and effectively controls its power consumption. Furthermore, a robustness analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of uncertainty in initial conditions and TCL parameters.</p>

            <h2>Self-Supervised One-Step Diffusion Refinement for Snapshot Compressive Imaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoguang Huang, Yunzhen Wang, Haijin Zeng, Hongyu Chen, Hongyan Zhang</p>
            <p>Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multispectral images (MSIs) using a single coded two-dimensional (2-D) measurement, but reconstructing high-fidelity MSIs from these compressed inputs remains a fundamentally ill-posed challenge. While diffusion-based reconstruction methods have recently raised the bar for quality, they face critical limitations: a lack of large-scale MSI training data, adverse domain shifts from RGB-pretrained models, and inference inefficiencies due to multi-step sampling. These drawbacks restrict their practicality in real-world applications. In contrast to existing methods, which either follow costly iterative refinement or adapt subspace-based embeddings for diffusion models (e.g. DiffSCI, PSR-SCI), we introduce a fundamentally different paradigm: a self-supervised One-Step Diffusion (OSD) framework specifically designed for SCI. The key novelty lies in using a single-step diffusion refiner to correct an initial reconstruction, eliminating iterative denoising entirely while preserving generative quality. Moreover, we adopt a self-supervised equivariant learning strategy to train both the predictor and refiner directly from raw 2-D measurements, enabling generalization to unseen domains without the need for ground-truth MSI. To further address the challenge of limited MSI data, we design a band-selection-driven distillation strategy that transfers core generative priors from large-scale RGB datasets, effectively bridging the domain gap. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach sets a new benchmark, yielding PSNR gains of 3.44 dB, 1.61 dB, and 0.28 dB on the Harvard, NTIRE, and ICVL datasets, respectively, while reducing reconstruction time by 97.5%. This remarkable improvement in efficiency and adaptability makes our method a significant advancement in SCI reconstruction, combining both accuracy and practicality for real-world deployment.</p>

            <h2>Learning Dissipative Chaotic Dynamics with Boundedness Guarantee</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunbochen Tang, Themistoklis Sapsis, Navid Azizan</p>
            <p>Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate prediction challenging. Recent approaches have focused on developing data-driven models that attempt to preserve invariant statistics over long horizons since many chaotic systems exhibit dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Despite the recent progress in such models, they are still often prone to generating unbounded trajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce a modular framework that provides formal guarantees of trajectory boundedness for neural network chaotic dynamics models. Our core contribution is a dissipative projection layer that leverages control-theoretic principles to ensure the learned system is dissipative. Specifically, our framework simultaneously learns a dynamics emulator and an energy-like function, where the latter is used to construct an algebraic dissipative constraint within the projection layer. Furthermore, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the system's strange attractor, which is known to be difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We demonstrate our model's ability to produce bounded long-horizon forecasts that preserve invariant statistics for chaotic dynamical systems, including Lorenz 96 and a reduced-order model of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoshen Wang, Zhentao Liu, Kaicong Sun, Xiaodong Wang, Dinggang Shen, Zhiming Cui</p>
            <p>The generation of medical images presents significant challenges due to their high-resolution and three-dimensional nature. Existing methods often yield suboptimal performance in generating high-quality 3D medical images, and there is currently no universal generative framework for medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce a 3D Medical Latent Diffusion (3D MedDiffusion) model for controllable, high-quality 3D medical image generation. 3D MedDiffusion incorporates a novel, highly efficient Patch-Volume Autoencoder that compresses medical images into latent space through patch-wise encoding and recovers back into image space through volume-wise decoding. Additionally, we design a new noise estimator to capture both local details and global structural information during diffusion denoising process. 3D MedDiffusion can generate fine-detailed, high-resolution images (up to 512x512x512) and effectively adapt to various downstream tasks as it is trained on large-scale datasets covering CT and MRI modalities and different anatomical regions (from head to leg). Experimental results demonstrate that 3D MedDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generative quality and exhibits strong generalizability across tasks such as sparse-view CT reconstruction, fast MRI reconstruction, and data augmentation for segmentation and classification.

            <h2>Aggregative games with bilevel structures: Distributed algorithms and convergence analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaihong Lu, Huanshui Zhang, Long Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, the problem of distributively seeking the equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of a virtual leader's objective function in the inner level, which depends on the actions of the players in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function of the virtual leader is formed by the sum of some local functions with two arguments, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument. When making decisions, each player in the outer level only has access to a local part of the virtual leader's objective function. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the leader are involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions while cooperatively minimizing the objective function of the virtual leader to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium point. Then, for the case where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the virtual leader are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of players' cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions to the Nash equilibrium point are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in bidirectional EV charging and discharging systems have spurred interest in workplace applications. However, real-world deployments face various dynamic factors, such as fluctuating electricity prices and uncertain EV departure times, that hinder effective energy management. To address these issues and minimize building electricity costs while meeting EV charging requirements, we design a hierarchical multi-agent structure in which a high-level agent coordinates overall charge or discharge decisions based on real-time pricing, while multiple low-level agents manage individual power level accordingly. For uncertain EV departure times, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware critic augmentation mechanism for low-level agents that improves the evaluation of power-level decisions and ensures robust control under such uncertainty. Building upon these two key designs, we introduce HUCA, a real-time charging control framework that coordinates energy supply among the building and EVs. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets show that HUCA significantly reduces electricity costs and maintains competitive performance in meeting EV charging requirements under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios. The results further highlight the importance of hierarchical control and the proposed critic augmentation under the uncertain departure scenario. A case study illustrates HUCA's capability to allocate energy between the building and EVs in real time, underscoring its potential for practical use.</p>

            <h2>RIFT: Entropy-Optimised Fractional Wavelet Constellations for Ideal Time-Frequency Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James M. Cozens, Simon J. Godsill</p>
            <p>We introduce a new method for estimating the Ideal Time-Frequency Representation (ITFR) of complex nonstationary signals. The Reconstructive Ideal Fractional Transform (RIFT) computes a constellation of Continuous Fractional Wavelet Transforms (CFWTs) aligned to different local time-frequency curvatures. This constellation is combined into a single optimised time-frequency energy representation via a localised entropy-based sparsity measure, designed to resolve auto-terms and attenuate cross-terms. Finally, a positivity-constrained Lucy-Richardson deconvolution with total-variation regularisation is applied to estimate the ITFR, achieving auto-term resolution comparable to that of the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), yielding the high-resolution RIFT representation. The required Cohen's class convolutional kernels are fully derived in the paper for the chosen CFWT constellations. Additionally, the optimisation yields an Instantaneous Phase Direction (IPD) field, which allows the localised curvature in speech or music extracts to be visualised and utilised within a Kalman tracking scheme, enabling the extraction of signal component trajectories and the construction of the Spline-RIFT variant. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world signals demonstrates the algorithm's ability to effectively suppress cross-terms and achieve superior time-frequency precision relative to competing methods. This advance holds significant potential for a wide range of applications requiring high-resolution cross-term-free time-frequency analysis.</p>

            <p>The U-Net architecture and its variants have remained state-of-the-art (SOTA) for retinal vessel segmentation over the past decade. In this study, we introduce a Full-Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where a novel feature representation module using modernized convolution blocks effectively captures full-scale structural information, while a guided convolution block subsequently refines this information. Specifically, we introduce an attention-guided filter within the guided convolution block, leveraging its similarity to unsharp masking to enhance fine vascular structures. Passing full-scale information to the attention block facilitates the generation of more contextually relevant attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, providing further refinement to the segmentation performance. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, ensuring flexibility and scalability across various segmentation tasks. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its compact architecture, FSG-Net delivers performance competitive with SOTA methods across multiple public datasets. Ablation studies further demonstrate that each proposed component meaningfully contributes to this competitive performance. Our code is available on this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Safeguarding Privacy in Edge Speech Understanding with Tiny Foundation Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsara Benazir, Felix Xiaozhu Lin</p>
            <p>Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce SpeechShield, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of SpeechShield hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement SpeechShield on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. SpeechShield with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. SpeechShield is 16x smaller in memory, 3.3x faster and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</p>

            <p>Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by introducing an explainability tool for spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, this tools retrieves the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compares it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We apply our tool on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. The tool reveals that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that require accurate imaging-based diagnosis, with segmentation playing a critical role in evaluating morphology and treatment decisions. Manual delineation of gliomas is time-consuming and prone to variability, motivating the use of deep learning to improve consistency and alleviate clinical workload. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the information available in multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), particularly inter-slice contextual features, and typically require considerable computational resources while lacking robustness across tumor type variations. We present GBT-SAM, a parameter-efficient deep learning framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a large-scale vision model, to volumetric mp-MRI data. GBT-SAM reduces input complexity by selecting fewer than 2.6\% of slices per scan while incorporating all four MRI modalities, preserving essential tumor-related information with minimal cost. Furthermore, our model is trained by a two-step fine-tuning strategy that incorporates a depth-aware module to capture inter-slice correlations and lightweight adaptation layers, resulting in just 6.5M trainable parameters, which is the lowest among SAM-based approaches. GBT-SAM achieves a Dice Score of 93.54 on the BraTS Adult Glioma dataset and demonstrates robust performance on Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. These results highlight GBT-SAM's potential as a computationally efficient and domain-robust framework for brain tumor segmentation using mp-MRI.

            <p>Structured state-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful architecture at the intersection of machine learning and control, featuring layers composed of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems followed by pointwise nonlinearities. These models combine the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the interpretability and inductive bias of dynamical systems, offering strong performance on long-sequence tasks with favorable computational complexity. However, their adoption in applications such as system identification and optimal control remains limited by the difficulty of enforcing stability and robustness in a principled and tractable manner. We introduce L2RU, a class of SSMs endowed with a prescribed $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain bound, guaranteeing input--output stability and robustness for all parameter values. The L2RU architecture is derived from free parametrizations of LTI systems satisfying an $\mathcal{L}_2$ constraint, enabling unconstrained optimization via standard gradient-based methods while preserving rigorous stability guarantees. Specifically, we develop two complementary parametrizations: a non-conservative formulation that provides a complete characterization of square LTI systems with a given $\mathcal{L}_2$-bound, and a conservative formulation that extends the approach to general (possibly non-square) systems while improving computational efficiency through a structured representation of the system matrices. Both parametrizations admit efficient initialization schemes that facilitate training long-memory models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a nonlinear system identification benchmark, where L2RU achieves improved performance and training stability compared to existing SSM architectures, highlighting its potential as a principled and robust building block for learning and control.</p>

            <p>Vector fields are advantageous in handling nonholonomic motion planning as they provide reference orientation for robots. However, additionally incorporating curvature constraints becomes challenging, due to the interconnection between the design of the curvature-bounded vector field and the tracking controller under underactuation. In this paper, we present a novel framework to co-develop the vector field and the control laws, guiding the nonholonomic robot to the target configuration with curvature-bounded trajectory. First, we formulate the problem by introducing the target positive limit set, which allows the robot to converge to or pass through the target configuration, depending on different dynamics and tasks. Next, we construct a curvature-constrained vector field (CVF) via blending and distributing basic flow fields in workspace and propose the saturated control laws with a dynamic gain, under which the tracking error's magnitude decreases even when saturation occurs. Under the control laws, kinematically constrained nonholonomic robots are guaranteed to track the reference CVF and converge to the target positive limit set with bounded trajectory curvature. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CVF method outperforms other vector-field-based algorithms. Experiments on Ackermann UGVs and semi-physical fixed-wing UAVs demonstrate that the method can be effectively implemented in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijie Pan, Zaint A. Alexakis, S Subhash Lakshminarayana, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE 118-bus test system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeder model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.</p>

            <p>Deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, but prior work has largely targeted conditions where diagnosis is relatively straightforward. More challenging problems remain underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. These lesions are difficult to diagnose due to subtle imaging features, often necessitating invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). We introduce ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and present a deep learning framework for Bankart lesion detection on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI contains shoulder MRIs from patients who underwent arthroscopy, providing ground-truth labels from intraoperative findings, the diagnostic gold standard. Separate models were trained for MRIs and MRAs using CNN- and transformer-based architectures, with predictions ensembled across multiple imaging planes. Our models achieved radiologist-level performance, with accuracy on standard MRIs surpassing radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation on independent hospital data demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluation, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and foster development of datasets and models that address clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.</p>

            <h2>PhySense: Sensor Placement Optimization for Accurate Physics Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuezhou Ma, Haixu Wu, Hang Zhou, Huikun Weng, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long</p>
            <p>Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

            <h2>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> TaeJun Ha, Chaehyun Jung, Hyeonuk Kim, Jeongwoo Park, Jeonghun Park</p>
            <p>In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation</p>

            <h2>Real-Time High-Accuracy Digital Wireless Time, Frequency, and Phase Calibration For Coherent Distributed Antenna Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason M. Merlo, Samuel Wagner, John Lancaster, Jeffrey A. Nanzer</p>
            <p>This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling radio frequency (RF) phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Tiranti, Francesco Wanderlingh, Enrico Simetti, Marco Baglietto, Giovanni Indiveri, Antonio Pascoal</p>
            <p>Accurate tracking of underwater acoustic sources is critical for a variety of marine applications, yet remains a challenging task due to communication constraints and environmental uncertainties. In this regard, this paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking using a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The core idea is to optimize the guidance of each agent to achieve coordinated motion planning that leads to optimal geometric configurations with respect to the target, thereby enhancing tracking performance. To tackle this, we propose a Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) framework to improve performance and robustness. The control problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization task, incorporating geometric observability, proximity to the target, and communication connectivity. A Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach, coupled with an Unscented Transform (UT)-based prediction scheme, is employed to ensure longterm tracking accuracy while accounting for uncertainties. The optimization is distributed using the sequential multi-agent decision-making framework, combined with the Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) communication protocol. The proposed methodology is implemented in a simulation environment that accounts for the constraints of acoustic communication. The approach is compared with existing methods such as decentralized MPC and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).</p>

            <h2>Zero-shot Denoising via Neural Compression: Theoretical and algorithmic framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Zafari, Xi Chen, Shirin Jalali</p>
            <p>Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: this https URL.</p>

            <p>This study presents a novel environment-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to augment the operational capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in underwater environments. Departing from traditional RL architectures, the proposed framework integrates an environment-aware network module that dynamically captures flow field data, effectively embedding this critical environmental information into the state space. This integration facilitates real-time environmental adaptation, significantly enhancing the AUV's situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Furthermore, the framework incorporates AUV structure characteristics into the optimization process, employing a large language model (LLM)-based iterative refinement mechanism that leverages both environmental conditions and training outcomes to optimize task performance. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework's superior performance, robustness and adaptability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Favaro, Jean-François Toubeau, François Vallée, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major electricity end-use with a substantial potential for providing grid services, such as demand response. Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics of buildings, a difficult task because nonlinear heat transfer and recurring daily cycles make historical data highly correlated and insufficient to generalize to new weather, occupancy, and control scenarios. This paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. Unlike traditional training approaches that minimize prediction errors, we employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) to learn the NN parameters with the objective of directly improving the HVAC cost performance. However, the discrete nature of MIQP hinders DFL, as it leads to undefined and discontinuous gradients, thus impeding standard gradient-based training. We leverage Stochastic Smoothing (SS) to enable efficient gradient computation without the need to differentiate the MIQP. Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms conventional identify-then-optimize (i.e., the thermal dynamics model is identified on historical data then used in optimization) and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-aware building control.</p>

            <p>Headphone-based spatial audio uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to simulate real-world acoustic environments. HRTFs are unique to everyone, due to personal morphology, shaping how sound waves interact with the body before reaching the eardrums. Here we present the extended SONICOM HRTF dataset which expands on the previous version released in 2023. The total number of measured subjects has now been increased to 300, with demographic information for a subset of the participants, providing context for the dataset's population and relevance. The dataset incorporates synthesised HRTFs for 200 of the 300 subjects, generated using Mesh2HRTF, alongside pre-processed 3D scans of the head and ears, optimised for HRTF synthesis. This rich dataset facilitates rapid and iterative optimisation of HRTF synthesis algorithms, allowing the automatic generation of large data. The optimised scans enable seamless morphological modifications, providing insights into how anatomical changes impact HRTFs, and the larger sample size enhances the effectiveness of machine learning approaches. To support analysis, we also introduce the Spatial Audio Metrics (SAM) Toolbox, a Python package designed for efficient analysis and visualisation of HRTF data, offering customisable tools for advanced research. Together, the extended dataset and toolbox offer a comprehensive resource for advancing personalised spatial audio research and development.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clement Ruah, Houssem Sifaou, Osvaldo Simeone, Bashir M. Al-Hashimi</p>
            <p>Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.</p>

            <h2>Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei Liu, Luping Ji, Jiaxiang Gou, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
            <p>Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwei Guo, Bohan Li, Hankun Wang, Zhihan Li, Shuai Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
            <p>Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from prompt sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Fluid-Antenna-aided AAV Secure Communications in Eavesdropper Uncertain Location</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingjie Wu, Junshan Luo, Weiyu Chen, Shilian Wang, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding</p>
            <p>For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.</p>

            <p>This letter explores intelligent scheduling of sensor-to-controller communication in networked control systems, particularly when data transmission incurs a cost. While the optimal controller in a standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, determining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling.</p>

            <p>Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are key enablers of next-generation wireless communications but face significant challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact channel features for feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure of near-field CSI and incur prohibitive computational overhead on practical mobile devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose the near-field efficient feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate near-field CSI feedback with reduced overhead under diverse hardware constraints. NEFT builds on a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone with progressive token reduction and multi-scale feature extraction, enabling compact and effective modeling of near-field channel characteristics. Furthermore, NEFT is extended with lightweight variants: NEFT-Compact applies multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce model complexity while preserving accuracy; NEFT-Hybrid adopts an attention-free CNN encoder to reduce encoder-side computation; and NEFT-Edge combines NEFT-Hybrid with KD to enable deployment on highly resource-constrained edge devices. Extensive simulations show that NEFT achieves a 15--21dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error over state-of-the-art methods, NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total FLOPs by 25-36% with negligible accuracy loss, while NEFT-Hybrid reduces encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.</p>

            <p>While mel-spectrograms have been widely utilized as intermediate representations in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), their inherent redundancy leads to inefficiency in learning text-speech alignment. Compact VAE-based latent representations have recently emerged as a stronger alternative, but they also face a fundamental optimization dilemma: higher-dimensional latent spaces improve reconstruction quality and speaker similarity, but degrade intelligibility, while lower-dimensional spaces improve intelligibility at the expense of reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we propose Semantic-VAE, a novel VAE framework that utilizes semantic alignment regularization in the latent space. This design alleviates the reconstruction-generation trade-off by capturing semantic structure in high-dimensional latent representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-VAE significantly improves synthesis quality and training efficiency. When integrated into F5-TTS, our method achieves 2.10% WER and 0.64 speaker similarity on LibriSpeech-PC, outperforming mel-based systems (2.23%, 0.60) and vanilla acoustic VAE baselines (2.65%, 0.59). We also release the code and models to facilitate further research.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems with multiplicative noise over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the regularized policy gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and almost-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-based regularized policy gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.</p>

            <p>Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters.

            <p>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at this http URL and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at this https URL.</p>

            <p>The consideration of stochastic uncertainty in optimal and predictive control is a well-explored topic. Recently Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) have seen a lot of considerations for problems involving stochastically uncertain system parameters and also for problems with additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances. While there exist a number of open-source PCE toolboxes, tailored open-source codes for the solution of OCPs involving additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances in julia are not available. Hence, this paper introduces the toolbox \texttt{this http URL} which enables to efficiently solve stochastic OCPs for a large class of disturbance distributions. We explain the main mathematical concepts between the PCE transcription of stochastic OCPs and how they are provided in the toolbox. We draw upon two examples to illustrate the functionalities of \texttt{this http URL}.</p>

            <h2>Assessing the Technical and Environmental Impacts of Energy Management Systems in Smart Ports</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youzhe Yang, Hafiz Majid Hussain, Juha Haakana, Pedro Nardelli</p>
            <p>A vital strategy for ports to mitigate the environmental impact of the maritime industry, while complying with frameworks such as the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), entails the systematic implementation of comprehensive energy management solutions. This paper provides a baseline evaluation of the energy management systems (EMSs) implementation and their impact on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and operational costs in smart ports. Initially, we provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on case studies from prominent ports, including Hamburg, Genoa, Jurong, and Shanghai Yangshan Phase IV. The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%. The study also identifies critical challenges, including system integration, data quality issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for standardization. These findings provide valuable insights for port authorities and policymakers, supporting the transition toward more sustainable and efficient port operations.</p>

            <h2>An Exact, Finite Dimensional Representation for Full-Block, Circle Criterion Multipliers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Biertümpfel, Bin Hu, Geir Dullerud, Peter Seiler</p>
            <p>This paper provides the first finite-dimensional characterization for the complete set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.</p>

            <h2>Deep Learning for Restoring MPI System Matrices Using Simulated Training Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artyom Tsanda, Sarah Reiss, Konrad Scheffler, Marija Boberg, Tobias Knopp</p>
            <p>Magnetic particle imaging reconstructs tracer distributions using a system matrix obtained through time-consuming, noise-prone calibration measurements. Methods for addressing imperfections in measured system matrices increasingly rely on deep neural networks, yet curated training data remain scarce. This study evaluates whether physics-based simulated system matrices can be used to train deep learning models for different system matrix restoration tasks, i.e., denoising, accelerated calibration, upsampling, and inpainting, that generalize to measured data. A large system matrices dataset was generated using an equilibrium magnetization model extended with uniaxial anisotropy. The dataset spans particle, scanner, and calibration parameters for 2D and 3D trajectories, and includes background noise injected from empty-frame measurements. For each restoration task, deep learning models were compared with classical non-learning baseline methods. The models trained solely on simulated system matrices generalized to measured data across all tasks: for denoising, DnCNN/RDN/SwinIR outperformed DCT-F baseline by >10 dB PSNR and up to 0.1 SSIM on simulations and led to perceptually better reconstuctions of real data; for 2D upsampling, SMRnet exceeded bicubic by 20 dB PSNR and 0.08 SSIM at $\times 2$-$\times 4$ which did not transfer qualitatively to real measurements. For 3D accelerated calibration, SMRnet matched tricubic in noiseless cases and was more robust under noise, and for 3D inpainting, biharmonic inpainting was superior when noise-free but degraded with noise, while a PConvUNet maintained quality and yielded less blurry reconstructions. The demonstrated transferability of deep learning models trained on simulations to real measurements mitigates the data-scarcity problem and enables the development of new methods beyond current measurement capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Building Energy Management System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoit Boulet Huiliang Zhang, Di Wu, Arnaud Zinflou</p>
            <p>The building sector is one of the largest contributors to global energy consumption. Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Scheduling and Aggregation Design for Asynchronous Federated Learning over Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chung-Hsuan Hu, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Palmeira Ferraz, Marcely Zanon Boito, Caroline Brun, Vassilina Nikoulina</p>
            <p>Whisper is a multitask and multilingual speech model covering 99 languages. It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Feng, Cong Zhang, Bo Wei</p>
            <p>We propose an SDP-based framework to address the stabilization of input delay systems while taking into account dissipative constraints. A key to our approach is the introduction of the concept of parameterized linear dynamical state feedbacks (LDSFs), which draws inspiration from recent advancements in the analyses of distributed delays. The parameterized LDSFs generalize conventional predictor controllers, where the interpretation of state prediction is concealed and their degree of parameterization can be increased by adjusting the integral kernels. A sufficient condition for the existence of dissipative LDSFs is formulated as matrix inequalities by constructing a complete type Krasovski\uı functional. To solve the bilinear matrix inequality in the synthesis condition, we employ an off-line inner convex approximation algorithm that can be initialized using the gains of predictor controllers obtained via explicit construction. So the unknowns of our LTDS can be computed by solving convex semidefinite programs. Numerical examples and simulations were experimented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanjie Cui, Xiaohong Liu, Jing Liang, Yamin Fu</p>
            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p>

            <p>Construction of a general-purpose post-recognition error corrector poses a crucial question: how can we most effectively train a model on a large mixture of domain datasets? The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark. NeKo performs competitively on grammar and post-OCR correction as a multi-task model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Akamatsu, Akinori F. Ebihara, Terumi Umematsu</p>
            <p>Blood pressure (BP) measurement is crucial for daily health assessment. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which extracts pulse waves from face videos captured by a camera, has the potential to enable convenient BP measurement without specialized medical devices. However, there are various uncertainties in BP estimation using rPPG, leading to limited estimation performance and reliability. In this paper, we propose U-FaceBP, an uncertainty-aware Bayesian ensemble deep learning method for face video-based BP measurement. U-FaceBP models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in face video-based BP estimation with a Bayesian neural network (BNN). Additionally, we design U-FaceBP as an ensemble method, estimating BP from rPPG signals, PPG signals derived from face videos, and face images using multiple BNNs. Large-scale experiments on two datasets involving 1197 subjects from diverse racial groups demonstrate that U-FaceBP outperforms state-of-the-art BP estimation methods. Furthermore, we show that the uncertainty estimates provided by U-FaceBP are informative and useful for guiding modality fusion, assessing prediction reliability, and analyzing performance across racial groups.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its diagonal scattering matrix. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on integrating a hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS into CF mMIMO systems to enhance coverage and spatial multiplexing. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, we propose a Riemannian limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (R-L-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence and finds higher-quality solutions compared with baselines, while also demonstrating a favorable performance-complexity trade-off.</p>

            <p>The growing scale of power systems and the increasing uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources necessitates novel optimization techniques that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy.</p>

This paper empirically evaluates two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra (SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate), and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS. Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue generation, despite higher computational demands.</p>

            <p>Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity are widely observed in the biological brain, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we find that when a learning method is regularized with L2 weight decay, its learning signal will gradually align with the direction of the Hebbian learning signal as it approaches stationarity. This Hebbian-like behavior is not unique to SGD: almost any learning rule, including random ones, can exhibit the same signature long before learning has ceased. We also provide a theoretical explanation for anti-Hebbian plasticity in regression tasks, demonstrating how it can arise naturally from gradient or input noise, and offering a potential reason for the observed anti-Hebbian effects in the brain. Certainly, our proposed mechanisms do not rule out any conventionally established forms of Hebbian plasticity and could coexist with them extensively in the brain. A key insight for neurophysiology is the need to develop ways to experimentally distinguish these two types of Hebbian observations.</p>

            <p>Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground-truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for evaluating brain visual decoding methods.</p>

            <p>We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.

            <p>Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps. This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness. Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability, demonstrates improved adaptability across multiple robotic hands, helping to alleviate annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping.

            <p>This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Venkatraman Renganathan, Sei Zhen Khong</p>
            <p>While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two stochastic linear time invariant systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.</p>

            <p>This note presents a novel, efficient economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. A new conception of convergence filters is defined to address the stability issue of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems. Three convergence filters are designed accordingly to be imposed into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon idea without explicit terminal state constraints is adopted to compromise the convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden of EMPC. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of the EMPC. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated by a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear optimization-based control policies, such as those those arising in nonlinear Model Predictive Control, have seen remarkable success in recent years. These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs online at each time-step. The resulting solution map, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the control policy is embedded in a gradient-based policy optimization scheme. We propose a principled way to regularize the nonlinear optimization problem, obtaining a surrogate derivative even if when the original problem is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.</p>

            <h2>HQCNN: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for Medical Image Classification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahjalal, Jahid Karim Fahim, Pintu Chandra Paul, Md Robin Hossain, Md. Tofael Ahmed, Dulal Chakraborty</p>
            <p>Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.</p>

            <h2>Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest distillation model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zilai Li</p>
            <p>The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that samples images by applying a neural network iteratively. However, the original sampling algorithm requires substantial computation cost, and reducing the sampling step is a prevailing research area. To cope with this problem, one mainstream approach is to treat the sampling process as an algorithm that solves an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our study proposes a training-free inference plugin compatible with most few-step ODE solvers. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first training-free algorithm to sample a 1024 x 1024-resolution image in 6 steps and a 512 x 512-resolution image in 5 steps, with an FID result that outperforms the SOTA distillation models and the 20-step DPM++ 2m solver, respectively. Based on analyses of the latent diffusion model's structure, the diffusion ODE, and the Free-U mechanism, we explain why specific hyperparameter couplings improve stability and inference speed without retraining. Meanwhile, experimental results also reveal a new design space of the latent diffusion ODE solver. Additionally, we also analyze the difference between the original diffusion model and the diffusion distillation model via an information-theoretic study, which shows the reason why the few-step ODE solver designed for the diffusion model can outperform the training-based diffusion distillation algorithm in few-step inference. The tentative results of the experiment prove the mathematical analysis. code base is below: this https URL</p>

            <h2>Towards Ethical AI in Power Electronics: How Engineering Practice and Roles Must Adapt</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fanfan Lin, Peter Wilson, Xinze Li, Alan Mantooth</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and the preparation of an AI-ready engineering workforce. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards, talent development initiatives, and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also oriented toward human and societal benefit.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Legged Locomotion via Online Learning for Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Zhou, Xiaoyu Zhang, Vasileios Tzoumas</p>
            <p>We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations, where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$, where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation. The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.</p>

            <h2>Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawei Dai, Yinxiu Zhou, Chenghang Li, Guolai Jiang, Chengfang Zhang</p>
            <p>In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.</p>

            <h2>SAD-Flower: Flow Matching for Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically Consistent Planning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzu-Yuan Huang, Armin Lederer, Dai-Jie Wu, Xiaobing Dai, Sihua Zhang, Stefan Sosnowski, Shao-Hua Sun, Sandra Hirche</p>
            <p>Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>PANDA -- Patch And Distribution-Aware Augmentation for Long-Tailed Exemplar-Free Continual Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddeshwar Raghavan, Jiangpeng He, Fengqing Zhu</p>
            <p>Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.</p>

            <h2>SCI: A Metacognitive Control for Signal Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Joshua Meesala</p>
            <p>Modern deep learning systems are typically deployed as open-loop function approximators: they map inputs to outputs in a single pass, without regulating how much computation or explanatory effort is spent on a given case. In safety-critical settings, this is brittle: easy and ambiguous inputs receive identical processing, and uncertainty is only read off retrospectively from raw probabilities. We introduce the Surgical Cognitive Interpreter (SCI), a lightweight closed-loop metacognitive control layer that wraps an existing stochastic model and turns prediction into an iterative process. SCI monitors a scalar interpretive state SP(t), here instantiated as a normalized entropy-based confidence signal, and adaptively decides whether to stop, continue sampling, or abstain. The goal is not to improve accuracy per se, but to regulate interpretive error {\Delta}SP and expose a safety signal that tracks when the underlying model is likely to fail. We instantiate SCI around Monte Carlo dropout classifiers in three domains: vision (MNIST digits), medical time series (MIT-BIH arrhythmia), and industrial condition monitoring (rolling-element bearings). In all cases, the controller allocates more inference steps to misclassified inputs than to correct ones (up to about 3-4x on MNIST and bearings, and 1.4x on MIT-BIH). The resulting {\Delta}SP acts as a usable safety signal for detecting misclassifications (AUROC 0.63 on MNIST, 0.70 on MIT-BIH, 0.86 on bearings). Code and reproducibility: this https URL</p>

            <h2>APULSE: A Scalable Hybrid Algorithm for the RCSPP on Large-Scale Dense Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nuno Soares, António Grilo</p>
            <p>The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.</p>

            <p>Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.</p>

            <h2>Automated Enumeration of Reconfigurable Architectures for Thermal Management Systems in Battery Electric Vehicles</h2>

            <p>As the automotive industry moves towards vehicle electrification, designing and optimizing thermal management systems (TMSs) for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) has become a critical focus in recent years. The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities.</p>

            <h2>An Equality Set Projection Approach for TSO-DSO Coordination Dispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Xicong Pang, Guangrui Wei, Haiwang Zhong, Grant Ruan, Zhengmao Li, Edris Pouresmaeil</p>
            <p>Coordinated optimization dispatch (COD) of transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO) can effectively ensure system security and efficiency under high-penetration distributed energy resource (DER) integration. Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching. Therefore, it is less sensitive to the increase of vertices and could efficiently construct the projection of high-dimensional FR. Case studies on a polyhedron dataset, IEEE 33-Bus System and T118D10 TSO-DSO system demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed COD approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward Moroshko, Weizhe Qin, Desen Kirli, Mohammed Qais, Sotirios Tsaftaris, Aristides Kiprakis</p>
            <p>Due to changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and storms, power systems around the globe are having to deal with increased imbalance between demand and supply and additional risk of loss of supply, calling for advanced control strategies that strengthen system resilience. This paper develops a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for coordination of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) that manages photovoltaic (PV) systems, batteries, and loads before, during, and after extreme weather events. A multi-objective mixed-integer quadratically constrained program is solved to enforce customer-priority tiers, serving critical loads first, while minimizing operating cost and PV curtailment under network and device constraints. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with real UK heatwave data show that, under realistic forecast errors and modeling uncertainties, MPC improves resilience by 11-20% relative to traditional full-horizon optimization. These results indicate the practical viability of receding-horizon coordination for resilient, low-carbon VPP operation during extreme weather.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Singular Perturbation-based Model Reduction for Heterogeneous Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Huang, Dixant B. Sapkota, Manish K. Singh</p>
            <p>Power systems are globally experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and complexity due to the advent of nonconventional generation and consumption technologies. To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation. However, several technical assumptions enabling traditional approaches are being challenged due to the heterogeneous, and often black-box, nature of modern power system component models. This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model. Numerical studies on a test system featuring synchronous machines, inverters, and line dynamics demonstrate the generalizability and accuracy of the developed approaches.</p>
