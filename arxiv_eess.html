            <h2>Finite Abstractions of Network of Impulsive Systems Using Dissipativity Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdalla Swikir</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a compositional framework for constructing finite abstractions of nonlinear interconnected impulsive systems using dissipativity-based conditions. Central to our approach is the concept of "alternating simulation functions," which serve to relate the concrete dynamics of impulsive subsystems to their finite abstractions. Dissipativity conditions are employed to ensure the compositionality of the finite abstractions, enabling the representation of complex interconnected systems as compositions of their subsystem abstractions. The methodology relies on incremental passivity properties such as supply rates and storage functions, alongside forward completeness, to construct finite abstractions for individual impulsive subsystems.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Efficient RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems: Application, Opportunities, and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Lu, Jiayi Zhang, Enyu Shi, Peng Zhang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) systems have emerged as a promising technology for sixth-generation communication systems. These systems capitalize on RIS to minimize power consumption, thereby achieving consistent performance and enhancing communication quality through the establishment and shaping of auxiliary signal propagation pathways between access points (APs) and users. However, integrating RIS into existing CF mMIMO infrastructures presents several technical challenges. This study delves into the signal transmission scheme and deployment architecture of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, addressing inherent challenges such as interference induced by RIS and the increased complexity in beam alignment. Furthermore, we address the complexities arising from the joint optimization of the reflection phase of RIS and beamforming technology at the APs, intending to fully exploit the reflection capabilities of RISs and beamforming technology to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. To overcome these challenges, we propose cooperation communication to suppress RIS-induced interference, beam tracking, and joint optimization to improve system EE. We also present specific examples of cooperative communication under the constraint of electromagnetic interference and the beam tracking of a mobile system. Additionally, we emphasize important research directions for RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, aiming to inspire future investigations.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Review: Impacts of Extreme Temperatures due to Climate Change on Power Grid Infrastructure and Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kishan Prudhvi Guddanti, Alok Kumar Bharati, Sameer Nekkalapu, Joseph McWheter, Scott Morris</p>
            <p>The power grid is experiencing a multi-fold transformation while the global climate evolves with record-breaking extreme temperatures during heat domes, polar vortices, and severe ice. Over the decades, these extreme temperature events have increased in frequency, duration, and intensity. The power grid infrastructure is geographically spread over thousands of square miles with millions of small and large components, and the impact of extreme temperature operations on the grid infrastructure needs to be researched further. This paper reviews academic literature, standards, industry articles, and federal reports to identify the impacts of heat domes, polar vortices, and icing on all the T&D grid equipment, including substations (assets owned and operated by the utilities and independent system operators). This paper classifies the equipment into primary and auxiliary equipment and determines its vulnerability to extreme temperatures for a deeper analysis of a more critical and vulnerable set of grid equipment. For each equipment under consideration, its fundamental role in the system, the impact of extreme temperatures on its operation, available monitoring, and mitigation of these impacts are discussed. The paper develops insights on standards readiness and identifies gaps concerning extreme temperature definitions. The paper also develops summary tables to identify the critical failure modes for each type of equipment, failure influence diagrams, and cascading influence diagrams to highlight and aid in translating the equipment vulnerability information into power grid contingency definitions that need to be considered in grid planning and operations.</p>

            <h2>LSCodec: Low-Bitrate and Speaker-Decoupled Discrete Speech Codec</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Chenpeng Du, Hankun Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
            <p>Although discrete speech tokens have exhibited strong potential for language model-based speech generation, their high bitrates and redundant timbre information restrict the development of such models. In this work, we propose LSCodec, a discrete speech codec that has both low bitrate and speaker decoupling ability. LSCodec adopts a three-stage unsupervised training framework with a speaker perturbation technique. A continuous information bottleneck is first established, followed by vector quantization that produces a discrete speaker-decoupled space. A discrete token vocoder finally refines acoustic details from LSCodec. By reconstruction experiments, LSCodec demonstrates superior intelligibility and audio quality with only a single codebook and smaller vocabulary size than baselines. The 25Hz version of LSCodec also achieves the lowest bitrate (0.25kbps) of codecs so far with decent quality. Voice conversion evaluations prove the satisfactory speaker disentanglement of LSCodec, and ablation study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed training framework.</p>

            <h2>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahran Rahman Alve, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan</p>
            <p>AI and deep learning are two recent innovations that have made a big difference in helping to solve problems in the clinical space. Using clinical imaging and sound examination, they also work on improving their vision so that they can spot diseases early and correctly. Because there aren't enough trained HR, clinical professionals are asking for help with innovation because it helps them adapt to more patients. Aside from serious health problems like cancer and diabetes, the effects of respiratory infections are also slowly getting worse and becoming dangerous for society. Respiratory diseases need to be found early and treated quickly, so listening to the sounds of the lungs is proving to be a very helpful tool along with chest X-rays. The presented research hopes to use deep learning ideas based on Convolutional Brain Organization to help clinical specialists by giving a detailed and thorough analysis of clinical respiratory sound data for Ongoing Obstructive Pneumonic identification. We used MFCC, Mel-Spectrogram, Chroma, Chroma (Steady Q), and Chroma CENS from the Librosa AI library in the tests we ran. The new system could also figure out how serious the infection was, whether it was mild, moderate, or severe. The test results agree with the outcome of the deep learning approach that was proposed. The accuracy of the framework arrangement has been raised to a score of 96% on the ICBHI. Also, in the led tests, we used K-Crisp Cross-Approval with ten parts to make the presentation of the new deep learning approach easier to understand. With a 96 percent accuracy rate, the suggested network is better than the rest. If you don't use cross-validation, the model is 90% accurate.</p>

            <h2>BEST-STD: Bidirectional Mamba-Enhanced Speech Tokenization for Spoken Term Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anup Singh, Kris Demuynck, Vipul Arora</p>
            <p>Spoken term detection (STD) is often hindered by reliance on frame-level features and the computationally intensive DTW-based template matching, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that encodes speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic semantic tokens. This facilitates fast retrieval using text-based search algorithms and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary terms. Our approach focuses on generating consistent token sequences across varying utterances of the same term. We also propose a bidirectional state space modeling within the Mamba encoder, trained in a self-supervised learning framework, to learn contextual frame-level features that are further encoded into discrete tokens. Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks. Empirical evaluation on LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases indicates that our method outperforms existing STD baselines while being more efficient.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Resource-Efficient CNN Architectures for Brain Tumor Classification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Ashik Khan, Rafath Bin Zafar Auvee</p>
            <p>Accurate brain tumor classification in MRI images is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment planning. While deep learning models like ResNet-18, VGG-16 have shown high accuracy, they often come with increased complexity and computational demands. This study presents a comparative analysis of effective yet simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and pre-trained ResNet18, and VGG16 model for brain tumor classification using two publicly available datasets: Br35H:: Brain Tumor Detection 2020 and Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. The custom CNN architecture, despite its lower complexity, demonstrates competitive performance with the pre-trained ResNet18 and VGG16 models. In binary classification tasks, the custom CNN achieved an accuracy of 98.67% on the Br35H dataset and 99.62% on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. For multi-class classification, the custom CNN, with a slight architectural modification, achieved an accuracy of 98.09%, on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. Comparatively, ResNet18 and VGG16 maintained high performance levels, but the custom CNNs provided a more computationally efficient alternative. Additionally,the custom CNNs were evaluated using few-shot learning (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 80 shots) to assess their robustness, achieving notable accuracy improvements with increased shots. This study highlights the potential of well-designed, less complex CNN architectures as effective and computationally efficient alternatives to deeper, pre-trained models for medical imaging tasks, including brain tumor classification. This study underscores the potential of custom CNNs in medical imaging tasks and encourages further exploration in this direction.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Feature-Based Subtyping and Model Ensemble for Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation</h2>

            <p>Accurate and automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is essential for quantitative measurements, which play an increasingly important role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving segmentation performance and generalizability for various brain tumor types.

            <h2>Adult Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa using Transfer Learning on Stratified Finetuning Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijeet Parida, Daniel Capellán-Martín, Zhifan Jiang, Austin Tapp, Xinyang Liu, Syed Muhammad Anwar, María J. Ledesma-Carbayo, Marius George Linguraru</p>
            <p>Gliomas, a kind of brain tumor characterized by high mortality, present substantial diagnostic challenges in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper introduces a novel approach to glioma segmentation using transfer learning to address challenges in resource-limited regions with minimal and low-quality MRI data. We leverage pre-trained deep learning models, nnU-Net and MedNeXt, and apply a stratified fine-tuning strategy using the BraTS2023-Adult-Glioma and BraTS-Africa datasets. Our method exploits radiomic analysis to create stratified training folds, model training on a large brain tumor dataset, and transfer learning to the Sub-Saharan context. A weighted model ensembling strategy and adaptive post-processing are employed to enhance segmentation accuracy. The evaluation of our proposed method on unseen validation cases on the BraTS-Africa 2024 task resulted in lesion-wise mean Dice scores of 0.870, 0.865, and 0.926, for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions and was ranked first for the challenge. Our approach highlights the ability of integrated machine-learning techniques to bridge the gap between the medical imaging capabilities of resource-limited countries and established developed regions. By tailoring our methods to a target population's specific needs and constraints, we aim to enhance diagnostic capabilities in isolated environments. Our findings underscore the importance of approaches like local data integration and stratification refinement to address healthcare disparities, ensure practical applicability, and enhance impact.

            <h2>Supertoroid fitting of objects with holes for robotic grasping and scene generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Badia Torres, Eric Carmona, Abhijit Makhal, Omid Heidari, Alba Perez Gracia</p>
            <p>One of the strategies to detect the pose and shape of unknown objects is their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities. Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders, but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to a wider variety of shapes. One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole. Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric modeling.</p>

            <h2>TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Krejčí, Oliver Kost, Ondřej Straka, Yuxuan Xia, Lennart Svensson, Ángel F. García-Fernández</p>
            <p>Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with unique performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</p>

            <h2>6D Rigid Body Localization and Velocity Estimation via Gaussian Belief Propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niclas Führling, Volodymyr Vizitiv, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Osvaldo Gonsa</p>
            <p>We propose a novel message-passing solution to the sixth-dimensional (6D) moving rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) translation vector and rotation angles, as well as their corresponding translational and angular velocities, are all estimated by only utilizing the relative range and Doppler measurements between the "anchor" sensors located at an 3D (rigid body) observer and the "target" sensors of another rigid body. The proposed method is based on a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework, employed to estimate the absolute sensor positions and velocities using a range- and Doppler-based received signal model, which is then utilized in the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized under a small-angle approximation. The method further incorporates a second bivariate GaBP designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation vectors, including an interference cancellation (IC) refinement stage to improve the angle estimation performance, followed by the estimation of the angular and the translational velocities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via simulations, which confirms its improved performance compared to equivalent state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques.</p>

            <h2>Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models are Simple Streaming Text to Speech Synthesizers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Yang, Ziyang Ma, Shujie Liu, Jinyu Li, Hui Wang, Lingwei Meng, Haiyang Sun, Yuzhe Liang, Ruiyang Xu, Yuxuan Hu, Yan Lu, Rui Zhao, Xie Chen</p>
            <p>This paper introduces Interleaved Speech-Text Language Model (IST-LM) for streaming zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS). Unlike many previous approaches, IST-LM is directly trained on interleaved sequences of text and speech tokens with a fixed ratio, eliminating the need for additional efforts in duration prediction and grapheme-to-phoneme alignment. The ratio of text chunk size to speech chunk size is crucial for the performance of IST-LM. To explore this, we conducted a comprehensive series of statistical analyses on the training data and performed correlation analysis with the final performance, uncovering several key factors: 1) the distance between speech tokens and their corresponding text tokens, 2) the number of future text tokens accessible to each speech token, and 3) the frequency of speech tokens precedes their corresponding text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate how to achieve an optimal streaming TTS system without complicated engineering optimization, which has a limited gap with the non-streaming system. IST-LM is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, paving the way for streaming TTS with minimal overhead while largely maintaining performance, showcasing broad prospects coupled with real-time text stream from LLMs.</p>

            <h2>A Language Model With Million Context Length For Raw Audio</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prateek Verma</p>
            <p>Modeling long-term dependencies for audio signals is a particularly challenging problem, as even small-time scales yield on the order of a hundred thousand samples. With the recent advent of Transformers, neural architectures became good at modeling dependencies over longer time scales, but they suffered from quadratic constraints to scale them. We propose a generative auto-regressive architecture that can model audio waveforms over quite a large context, greater than 500,000 samples. Our work is adapted to learn time dependencies by learning a latent representation by a CNN front-end, and then learning dependencies over these representations using Transformer encoders, fully trained end-to-end: thereby allowing to learn representations as it deems fit for the next sample. Unlike previous works that compared different time scales to show improvement, we use a standard dataset, with the same number of parameters/context to show improvements. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance as compared to other approaches such as Wavenet, SaSHMI, and Sample-RNN on a standard dataset for modeling long-term structure. This work gives very exciting direction for the field, given improvements in context modeling that can be scaled with more data, as well as potentially better results by using billions/trillions of parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Abate, Alec Edwards, Mirco Giacobbe, Hashan Punchihewa, Diptarko Roy</p>
            <p>We present a data-driven approach to the quantitative verification of probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models. Our approach leverages neural networks to compute tight and sound bounds for the probability that a stochastic process hits a target condition within finite time. This problem subsumes a variety of quantitative verification questions, from the reachability and safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models, to the study of assertion-violation and termination analysis of probabilistic programs. We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed. We demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmarks that, thanks to the expressive power of neural networks, our method yields smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing symbolic methods in all cases, and that our approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.</p>

            <h2>Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihab S. Mohamed, Junhong Xu, Gaurav S Sukhatme, Lantao Liu</p>
            <p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p>

            <h2>Symbolic Infinite-State LTL Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaun Azzopardi, Nir Piterman, Luca Di Stefano, Gerardo Schneider</p>
            <p>Recently interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to more practical richer-than-Boolean domains. One of the major challenges in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. This isolated problem, by itself, is already undecidable, and forms part of the overall difficulty of this kind of synthesis tasks. Relatively successful approaches exist for deterministic games with at most B{ü}chi conditions. Our contribution goes beyond, being the first effective approach for solving symbolic synthesis problems with full LTL objectives, based on novel liveness refinements guided by the underlying game. Our CEGAR-based approach relies on a sound boolean abstraction of the problem, spuriousness checking of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and extracting fresh safety or liveness properties of the concrete game from counterexamples. The latter are used to refine the abstraction, which is used to re-attempt synthesis. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on LIA benchmarks from literature. We also introduce benchmarks that are out of scope for all other approaches.</p>

            <h2>Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

            <h2>On the Spectral Efficiency of Indoor Wireless Networks with a Rotary Uniform Linear Array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo Noboro Tominaga, Onel Luis Alcaraz López, Tommy Svensson, Richard Demo Souza, Hirley Alves</p>
            <p>Contemporary wireless communication systems rely on Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) techniques. In such systems, each Access Point (AP) is equipped with multiple antenna elements and serves multiple devices simultaneously. Notably, traditional systems utilize fixed antennas, i.e., antennas without any movement capabilities, while the idea of movable antennas has recently gained traction among the research community. By moving in a confined region, movable antennas are able to exploit the wireless channel variation in the continuous domain. This additional degree of freedom may enhance the quality of the wireless links, and consequently the communication performance. However, movable antennas for MU-MIMO proposed in the literature are complex, bulky, expensive and present a high power consumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative to such systems that has lower complexity and lower cost. More specifically, we propose the incorporation of rotation capabilities to APs equipped with Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs) of antennas. We consider the uplink of an indoor scenario where the AP serves multiple devices simultaneously. The optimal rotation of the ULA is computed based on estimates of the positions of the active devices and aiming at maximizing the per-user mean achievable Spectral Efficiency (SE). Adopting a spatially correlated Rician channel model, our numerical results show that the rotation capabilities of the AP can bring substantial improvements in the SE in scenarios where the line-of-sight component of the channel vectors is strong. Moreover, our proposed system is robust against imperfect positioning estimates.</p>

            <p>Cyborg insects refer to hybrid robots that integrate living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control. These creatures exhibit advantages over conventional robots in adaption to complex terrain and sustained energy efficiency. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. Regarding this issue, we propose a swarm navigation algorithm and verify it under experiments. This research advances swarm robotics by integrating biological organisms with control theory to develop intelligent autonomous systems for real-world applications.</p>

            <h2>Saturation of the Multiparameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound at the Single-Copy Level with Projective Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendra I. Nurdin</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyang Cai, Chuchu Fan, Stanley Bak</p>
            <p>Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</p>

            <p>Edge-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies are increasingly prevalent in the development of intelligent and personalized assistants. However, resource-constrained ASR models face significant challenges in adaptivity, incrementality, and inclusivity when faced with a diverse population. To tackle those challenges, we propose PI-Whisper, a novel ASR system that adaptively enhances recognition capabilities by identifying speakers' characteristics in real-time. In this work, we show how the design of PI-Whisper allows for incremental adaptation of new characteristics without the need for repetitive retraining, enhances recognition capabilities, and improves equity and fairness across diverse speaker groups. PI-Whisper demonstrates these advantages by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing the word error rate (WER) by up to 13.7% relative to baselines while scaling linearly to computing resources.</p>

            <h2>Behavioral Learning of Dish Rinsing and Scrubbing based on Interruptive Direct Teaching Considering Assistance Rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shumpei Wakabayashi, Kento Kawaharazuka, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba</p>
            <p>Robots are expected to manipulate objects in a safe and dexterous way. For example, washing dishes is a dexterous operation that involves scrubbing the dishes with a sponge and rinsing them with water. It is necessary to learn it safely without splashing water and without dropping the dishes. In this study, we propose a safe and dexterous manipulation system. The robot learns a dynamics model of the object by estimating the state of the object and the robot itself, the control input, and the amount of human assistance required (assistance rate) after the human corrects the initial trajectory of the robot's hands by interruptive direct teaching. By backpropagating the error between the estimated and the reference value using the acquired dynamics model, the robot can generate a control input that approaches the reference value, for example, so that human assistance is not required and the dish does not move excessively. This allows for adaptive rinsing and scrubbing of dishes with unknown shapes and properties. As a result, it is possible to generate safe actions that require less human assistance.</p>

            <h2>Full-text Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential for error correction in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most research focuses on utterances from short-duration speech recordings, which are the predominant form of speech data for supervised ASR training. This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for error correction in full-text generated by ASR systems from longer speech recordings, such as transcripts from podcasts, news broadcasts, and meetings. First, we develop a Chinese dataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that involves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor. This dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both full-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the correction process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the constructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and evaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design prompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats, such as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs. Through various test settings, including homogeneous, up-to-date, and hard test sets, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs perform well in the full-text setting with different prompts, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. This establishes a promising baseline for further research. The dataset is available on the website.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sripathi Sridhar, Mark Cartwright</p>
            <p>Human auditory perception is compositional in nature -- we identify auditory streams from auditory scenes with multiple sound events. However, such auditory scenes are typically represented using clip-level representations that do not disentangle the constituent sound sources. In this work, we learn source-centric audio representations where each sound source is represented using a distinct, disentangled source embedding in the audio representation. We propose two novel approaches to learning source-centric audio representations: a supervised model guided by classification and an unsupervised model guided by feature reconstruction, both of which outperform the baselines. We thoroughly evaluate the design choices of both approaches using an audio classification task. We find that supervision is beneficial to learn source-centric representations, and that reconstructing audio features is more useful than reconstructing spectrograms to learn unsupervised source-centric representations. Leveraging source-centric models can help unlock the potential of greater interpretability and more flexible decoding in machine listening.</p>

By incorporating a novel trainable scale matrix, NanoVoice mitigates potential performance degradation during parameter sharing. NanoVoice achieves performance comparable to the baselines, while training 4 times faster and using 45 percent fewer parameters for speaker adaptation with 40 reference voices.

            <h2>HDMoLE: Mixture of LoRA Experts with Hierarchical Routing and Dynamic Thresholds for Fine-Tuning LLM-based ASR Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingshen Mu, Kun Wei, Qijie Shao, Yong Xu, Lei Xie</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with automatic speech recognition (ASR) have performed remarkably in general domains. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of all model parameters is often employed to adapt pre-trained LLM-based ASR models to specific domains, it imposes high computational costs and notably reduces their performance in general domains. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient multi-domain fine-tuning method for adapting pre-trained LLM-based ASR models to multi-accent domains without catastrophic forgetting named \textit{HDMoLE}, which leverages hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds based on combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with the mixer of experts (MoE) and can be generalized to any linear layer. Hierarchical routing establishes a clear correspondence between LoRA experts and accent domains, improving cross-domain collaboration among the LoRA experts. Unlike the static Top-K strategy for activating LoRA experts, dynamic thresholds can adaptively activate varying numbers of LoRA experts at each MoE layer. Experiments on the multi-accent and standard Mandarin datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HDMoLE. Applying HDMoLE to an LLM-based ASR model projector module achieves similar performance to full fine-tuning in the target multi-accent domains while using only 9.6% of the trainable parameters required for full fine-tuning and minimal degradation in the source general domain.</p>

            <p>Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p>

            <p>Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize reverberant speech for the spoken content. Previous works focus on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS2KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and Gemini-generated semantic captions as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to effectively integrate both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on the respective contributions of each this http URL enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive speech experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech. Demos and code are available at: this https URL.</p>

            <p>In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers are computationally expensive, and Mambas face CUDA dependence and local correlation loss. In this paper, we propose CDXFormer, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Our submission secured the first place among all participating teams, excluding the official baseline.

The PS-SQA is designed based on the self-supervised-learning (SSL) MOS predictor, incorporating singing pitch and spectral information, which are extracted using pitch histogram and non-quantized neural codec, respectively. Additionally, the PS-SQA introduces a bias correction strategy to address prediction biases caused by low-resource training samples, and employs model fusion technology to further enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that our proposed PS-SQA significantly outperforms all competing systems across all system-level metrics, confirming its strong sing quality assessment capabilities.</p>

Further, we provide a set of conditions equivalent to testing a given H-infinity norm bound, as in the bounded real lemma. These feature the stability of a coefficient matrix similar to the Hamiltonian, a solution to two conic inequalities, and a stabilizing cone-preserving solution to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Ran, Zhichang Guo, Jia Li, Yao Li, Martin Burger, Boying Wu</p>
            <p>The removal of multiplicative Gamma noise is a critical research area in the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, where neural networks serve as a potent tool. However, real-world data often diverges from theoretical models, exhibiting various disturbances, which makes the neural network less effective. Adversarial attacks can be used as a criterion for judging the adaptability of neural networks to real data, since adversarial attacks can find the most extreme perturbations that make neural networks ineffective. In this work, the diffusion equation is designed as a regularization block to provide sufficient regularity to the whole neural network, due to its spontaneous dissipative nature. We propose a tunable, regularized neural network framework that unrolls a shallow denoising neural network block and a diffusion regularity block into a single network for end-to-end training. The linear heat equation, known for its inherent smoothness and low-pass filtering properties, is adopted as the diffusion regularization block. In our model, a single time step hyperparameter governs the smoothness of the outputs and can be adjusted dynamically, significantly enhancing flexibility. The stability and convergence of our model are theoretically proven. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively eliminates high-frequency oscillations induced by adversarial attacks. Finally, the proposed model is benchmarked against several state-of-the-art denoising methods on simulated images, adversarial samples, and real SAR images, achieving superior performance in both quantitative and visual evaluations.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized audio-driven talking head synthesis. Beyond precise lip synchronization, diffusion-based methods excel in generating subtle expressions and natural head movements that are well-aligned with the audio signal. However, these methods are confronted by slow inference speed, insufficient fine-grained control over facial motions, and occasional visual artifacts largely due to an implicit latent space derived from Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which prevent their adoption in realtime interaction applications. To address these issues, we introduce Ditto, a diffusion-based framework that enables controllable realtime talking head synthesis. Our key innovation lies in bridging motion generation and photorealistic neural rendering through an explicit identity-agnostic motion space, replacing conventional VAE representations. This design substantially reduces the complexity of diffusion learning while enabling precise control over the synthesized talking heads. We further propose an inference strategy that jointly optimizes three key components: audio feature extraction, motion generation, and video synthesis. This optimization enables streaming processing, realtime inference, and low first-frame delay, which are the functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and substantially outperforms existing methods in both motion control and realtime performance.</p>

            <p>Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</p>

            <p>With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication for sixth-generation (6G) network is emerging as a revolutionary architecture. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a retrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication technologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers to the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In addition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the standardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that could drive the evolution and refinement of AI and communication for 6G, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation communication infrastructure.</p>

We integrate an implicit proximal denoiser prior, associated with a deep learning based denoiser, within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework to effectively remove noise from the eigenimages linked to the low-rank representation. Anomalies are characterized using a generalized group sparsity measure, denoted as $\|\cdot\|_{2,\psi}$. To solve the resulting orthogonal constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, we develop a PnP-proximal block coordinate descent (PnP-PBCD) method, where the eigenimages are updated using a proximal denoiser within the PnP framework. We prove that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the PnP-PBCD method is a stationary point. We evaluate the effectiveness of the PnP-PBCD method on hyperspectral anomaly detection in scenarios with and without Gaussian noise contamination. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect anomalous objects, outperforming the competing methods that may mistakenly identify noise as anomalies or misidentify the anomalous objects due to noise interference.</p>

            <h2>LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sangmin Lee, Woo-Jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang</p>
            <p>Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</p>

            <h2>Improving diabetic retinopathy screening using Artificial Intelligence: design, evaluation and before-and-after study of a custom development</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imanol Pinto, Álvaro Olazarán, David Jurío, Borja de la Osa, Miguel Sainz, Aritz Oscoz, Jerónimo Ballaz, Javier Gorricho, Mikel Galar, José Andonegui</p>
            <p>Background: The worst outcomes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be prevented by implementing DR screening programs assisted by AI. At the University Hospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus images in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening level (ophthalmologist) target patients. Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom AI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper introduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique combination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its impact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares 19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients screened after. Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing their sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for non-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\% to 86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in most of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them as referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study visualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of sight-threatening DR referred by a GP. Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which could be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening. This shows how AI devices, when seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, can help improve clinical pathways in the long term.</p>

            <p>Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) represent the future of transportation, utilizing detailed traffic information to enhance control and decision-making. Eco-driving of CAVs has the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency, and the benefits are maximized when both vehicle speed and powertrain operation are optimized. In this paper, we studied the co-optimization of vehicle speed and powertrain management for energy savings in a dual-motor electric vehicle. Control-oriented vehicle dynamics and electric powertrain models were developed to transform the problem into an optimal control problem specifically designed to facilitate real-time computation. Simulation validation was conducted using real-world data calibrated traffic simulation scenarios in Chattanooga, TN. Evaluation results demonstrated a 12.80-24.52% reduction in the vehicle's power consumption under ideal predicted traffic conditions, while maintaining benefits with various prediction uncertainties, such as Gaussian process uncertainties on acceleration and time-shift effects on predicted speed. The energy savings of the proposed eco-driving strategy are achieved through effective speed control and optimized torque allocation. The proposed model can be extended to various CAV and electric vehicle applications, with potential adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios.</p>

            <p>The growing threats of uncertainties, anomalies, and cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry-standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non-actionable results. Estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge. This thesis addresses robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm -- Physics-ML Synergy -- which integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats, pinpointing dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimizations to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by interconnecting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akram Shafie, Jinhong Yuan, Nan Yang, Hai Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the time-frequency (TF) localization characteristics of the prototype pulse of orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing modulation, namely, the DD plane orthogonal pulse (DDOP). The TF localization characteristics examine how concentrated or spread out the energy of a pulse is in the joint TF domain, the time domain (TD), and the frequency domain (FD). We first derive the TF localization metrics of the DDOP, including its TF area, its time and frequency dispersions, and its direction parameter. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the DDOP exhibits a high energy spread in the TD, FD, and the joint TF domain, while adhering to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thereafter, we discuss the potential advantages brought by the energy spread of the DDOP, especially with regard to harnessing both time and frequency diversities and enabling fine-resolution sensing. Subsequently, we examine the relationships between the time and frequency dispersions of the DDOP and those of the envelope functions of DDOP's TD and FD representations, paving the way for simplified determination of the TF localization metrics for more generalized variants of the DDOP and the pulses used in other DD domain modulation schemes. Finally, using numerical results, we validate our analysis and find further insights.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading communication performance. Existing hybrid precoding designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware hybrid precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware to enhance integrated gain. We introduce a squint-aware optimization-based hybrid precoding algorithm (SA-Opt) and develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</p>

            <h2>A Proximity-Based Approach for Dynamically Matching Industrial Assets and Their Operators Using Low-Power IoT Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvano Cortesi, Michele Crabolu, Prodromos-Vasileios Mekikis, Giovanni Bellusci, Christian Vogt, Michele Magno</p>
            <p>Asset tracking solutions have proven their significance in industrial contexts, as evidenced by their successful commercialization (e.g., Hilti On!Track). However, a seamless solution for matching assets with their users, such as operators of construction power tools, is still missing. By enabling assetuser matching, organizations gain valuable insights that can be used to optimize user health and safety, asset utilization, and maintenance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this gap by leveraging existing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed framework comprises the following components: i) a wearable device, ii) an IoT device attached to or embedded in the assets, iii) an algorithm to estimate the distance between assets and operators by exploiting simple received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and iv) a cloud-based algorithm that collects all estimated distances to derive the correct asset-operator matching. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through indoor and outdoor experiments in a construction setting for identifying the operator of a power tool. A physical prototype was developed to evaluate the algorithms in a realistic setup. The results demonstrated a median accuracy of 0.49m in estimating the distance between assets and users, and up to 98.6% in correctly matching users with their assets.</p>

            <h2>Parametric Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Wideband Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alva Kosasih, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson</p>
            <p>A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) alters the reflection of incoming signals based on the phase-shift configuration assigned to its elements. This feature can be used to improve the signal strength for user equipments (UEs), expand coverage, and enhance spectral efficiency in wideband communication systems. Having accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable to realize the full potential of RIS-aided wideband systems. Unfortunately, CSI is challenging to acquire due to the passive nature of the RIS elements, which cannot perform transmit/receive signal processing. Recently, a parametric maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimator has been developed and demonstrated excellent estimation accuracy. However, this estimator is designed for narrowband systems with no non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we develop a novel parametric ML channel estimator for RIS-assisted wideband systems, which can handle line-of-sight (LOS) paths in the base station (BS)-RIS and RIS-UE links as well as NLOS paths between the UE, BS, and RIS. We leverage the reduced subspace representation induced by the array geometry to suppress noise in unused dimensions, enabling accurate estimation of the NLOS paths. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates superior estimation performance for the BS-UE and RIS-UE channels, outperforming the existing ML channel estimator.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enea Figini, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Large District Heating System Models Using Open-Source Data and Tools: An Exemplary Workflow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Stock, Till Schmidt, André Xhonneux, Dirk Müller</p>
            <p>District heating (DH) systems play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the building sector's heat supply. While innovative low-exergy DH and cooling systems are increasingly adopted in new developments, the transformation of existing DH systems remains critical, as many still depend on fossil-based heating plants. Achieving a sustainable heat supply necessitates integrating renewable energy and waste heat sources into current DH systems and enhancing operational efficiency through measures such as reduced supply temperatures and advanced control algorithms. These improvements can reduce costs and CO2 emissions but may require infrastructure adaptations, including pipe replacements and building-level system adjustments. This paper introduces a workflow for generating DH models using publicly available data and open-source tools. Such models enable comprehensive analyses of existing DH systems, allowing for the evaluation of sustainable heat integration, operational improvements, and the testing of analytical tools, such as simulation and optimization models. The workflow, detailed in this study, combines general structural data with computational estimations to create digital representations of DH systems. These models facilitate scenario-based analyses, tool benchmarking, and the identification of necessary infrastructure adaptations. Two example DH models generated using the proposed workflow are presented, followed by a discussion of the methodology's applicability and limitations. This study demonstrates how leveraging open data and tools can advance the transformation of DH systems, supporting the transition to a sustainable heat supply infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</p>

            <h2>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingzhu Wen, Yong Zhou, Xiaoyang Li, Yuanming Shi, Kaibin Huang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p>

            <h2>RIS-aided Wireless-Powered Backscatter Communications for Sustainable Internet of Underground Things</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiang Lin, Yijie Mao</p>
            <p>Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</p>

            <h2>Generative Modeling and Data Augmentation for Power System Production Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>As a key component of power system production simulation, load forecasting is critical for the stable operation of power systems. Machine learning methods prevail in this field. However, the limited training data can be a challenge. This paper proposes a generative model-assisted approach for load forecasting under small sample scenarios, consisting of two steps: expanding the dataset using a diffusion-based generative model and then training various machine learning regressors on the augmented dataset to identify the best performer. The expanded dataset significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to the original dataset, and the diffusion model outperforms the generative adversarial model by achieving about 200 times smaller errors and better alignment in latent data distributions.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-Theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic, Battery, and Grid Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Sang, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Solar PV and battery storage systems have become integral to modern power grids. Therefore, bulk grid models in real-time operation must include their physical behavior accurately for analysis and optimization. AC state estimation is critical to building real-time bulk power systems models. However, current ACSE techniques do not include detailed physics and measurements for battery and PV systems. This results in sub-optimal estimation results and subsequent less accurate bulk grid models for real-time operation. To address these challenges, we formulate a circuit-theoretic AC state estimator with accurate PV and battery systems physics and corresponding measurements. First, we propose an aggregated equivalent circuit model of the solar PV, battery, and traditional grid components. Next, we add measurements from PV and battery systems to the traditional measurement set to facilitate accurate estimation of the overall grid model. Finally, we develop a circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm that can accurately estimate grid, PV, and battery system states and is robust against erroneous parameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we estimate the states of 10k node transmission networks with hundreds of battery+PV-tied systems. We compare the accuracy against the estimation of stand-alone grid, battery, and PV systems.</p>

            <p>Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p>

            <p>Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.Vivienne Liu, Vivek Srikrishnan, Kenji Doering, Elnaz Kabir, Scott Steinschneider, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</p>
