            <h2>Transforming Computational Lithography with AC and AI -- Faster, More Accurate, and Energy-efficient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saumyadip Mukhopadhyay, Kiho Yang, Kasyap Thottasserymana Vasudevan, Mounica Jyothi Divvela, Selim Dogru, Dilip Krishnamurthy, Fergo Treska, Werner Gillijns, Ryan Ryoung han Kim, Kumara Sastry, Vivek Singh</p>
            <p>From climate science to drug discovery, scientific computing demands have surged dramatically in recent years -- driven by larger datasets, more sophisticated models, and higher simulation fidelity. This growth rate far outpaces transistor scaling, leading to unsustainably rising costs, energy consumption, and emissions. Semiconductor manufacturing is no exception. Computational lithography -- involving transferring circuitry to silicon in diffraction-limited conditions -- is the largest workload in semiconductor manufacturing. It has also grown exceptionally complex as miniaturization has advanced in the angstrom-era, requiring more accurate modeling, intricate corrections, and broader solution-space exploration. Accelerated computing (AC) offers a solution by dramatically freeing up the compute and power envelope. AI augments these gains by serving as high-fidelity surrogates for compute-intensive steps. Together, they present a sustainable, next-generation computing platform for scientific workloads. This new paradigm needs a fundamental redesign of the software stack. For computational lithography, NVIDIA cuLitho reinvents the core primitives -- diffractive optics, computational geometry, multi-variant optimization, data processing -- to achieve a transformative 57X end-to-end acceleration. Beyond dramatically faster cycles, this expanded compute envelope enables more rigorous solutions, including curvilinear masks, high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (high-NA EUV) lithography, and subatomic modeling. We reinvest a small fraction of the freed-up compute to include through-focus correction for better process resilience. Silicon experiments at IMEC show significant benefits compared to conventional methods -- 35% better process window and 19% better edge placement error. This is the first quantified chip-scale demonstration of the lithography benefits of AC and AI in silicon.</p>

            <h2>Fine-Tuning LLMs to Generate Economical and Reliable Actions for the Power Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Chehade, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) force rapid topology changes that can render standard operating points infeasible, requiring operators to quickly identify corrective transmission switching actions that reduce load shedding while maintaining acceptable voltage behavior. We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set. Code and data-generation scripts are released to support reproducibility.</p>

Using this model, we analyze the sensitivity of SG dynamics to VSG parameters, highlighting trade-offs in choosing virtual inertia and governor lag, the limited effect of damper-winding emulation, and several others.</p>

            <h2>Waveform Design for ISAC System: A Consensus ADMM Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngoc-Son Duong, Huyen-Trang Ta, Quang-Tang Ngo, Thi-Hue Duong, Van-Lap Nguyen, Cong-Minh Nguyen, Minh-Tran Nguyen, Thai-Mai Dinh</p>
            <p>We study joint transmit-waveform and receive-filter design for a multi-user downlink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under practical constant-modulus and similarity constraints. We cast the design as a unified multi-objective program that balances communication sum rate and sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this, we introduce an efficient algorithm that use consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to alternately update the transmit waveform and radar filter. The proposed method effectively handles the non-convex fractional sensing's SINR formulation and ensures fast convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better trade-offs between communication sum rate and sensing's SINR compared to existing benchmark schemes.</p>

            <h2>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishav Sen, Fangqi Liu, Jose Paolo Talusan, Ava Pettet, Yoshinori Suzue, Mark Bailey, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey</p>
            <p>The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</p>

            <h2>SIM-assisted Secure Mobile Communications via Enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Ma, Bin Lin, Hongyang Pan, Geng Sun, Enyu Shi, Jiancheng An, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>With the development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, the security challenges are becoming increasingly prominent, especially for mobile users (MUs). As a promising solution, physical layer security (PLS) technology leverages the inherent characteristics of wireless channels to provide security assurance. Particularly, stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) directly manipulates electromagnetic waves through their multilayer structures, offering significant potential for enhancing PLS performance in an energy efficient manner. Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments. Consequently, we formulate a joint power and phase shift optimization problem (JPPSOP), aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of all MUs. Given the non-convexity and dynamic nature of this optimization problem, we propose an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm with a bidirectional long short-term memory mechanism, an off-policy data utilization mechanism, and a policy feedback mechanism (PPO-BOP). Through these mechanisms, the proposed algorithm can effectively capture short-term channel fading and long-term MU mobility, improve sample utilization efficiency, and enhance exploration capabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PPO-BOP significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and other deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of ASR.https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2026.3658332</p>

            <h2>Bayesian Model-based Generation of Synthetic Unbalanced Distribution Networks Incorporating Reliability Indices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique O. Caetano, Rahul K. Gupta, Cristhian G. da R. de Oliveira, João B. A. London Jr, Carlos Dias Maciel</p>
            <p>Real-world power distribution data are often inaccessible due to privacy and security concerns, highlighting the need for tools for generating realistic synthetic networks. Existing methods typically overlook critical reliability metrics such as the Customer Average Interruption Frequency Index (CAIFI) and the Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI). Moreover, these methods often neglect phase consistency during the design stage, necessitating the use of a separate phase assignment algorithm. This work proposes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) that generates phase-consistent unbalanced three-phase distribution systems, and incorporates reliability indices. The BHM learns the joint distribution of phase configuration, power demand, and reliability indices from a reference network, conditioning these attributes on topological features. We apply the proposed methodology to generate synthetic power distribution networks in Brazil, and validated it on known Brazilian networks. The results show that the BHM accurately reproduces the distributions of phase allocation, power demand, and reliability metrics on the training system. Furthermore, in out-of-sample validation on unseen data, the model generates phase-consistent networks and accurately predicts the reliability indices for the synthetic systems. The generated networks are also electrically feasible: three-phase power flows converge and voltages remain within typical operating limits, enabling studies of planning, reliability, and resilience.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Reachability Analysis of Multi-scale Voltage Dynamics Using Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Hashima, Hikaru Hoshino, Luis David Pabón Ospina, Eiko Furutani</p>
            <p>Voltage stability in modern power systems involves coupled dynamics across multiple time scales. Conventional methods based on time-scale separation or static stability margins may overlook instabilities caused by the coupling of slow and fast transients. Uncertainty in operating conditions further complicates stability assessment, and high computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations limit its applicability to multi-scale dynamics. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based framework for probabilistic reachability analysis of multi-scale voltage dynamics. By formulating each instability mechanism as a distinct absorbing state and introducing a multi-critic architecture for mechanism-specific learning, the proposed method enables consistent learning of risk probabilities associated with multiple instability types within a unified framework. The approach is demonstrated on a four-bus system with load tap changers and over-excitation limiters, illustrating effectiveness of the proposed learning-based reachability analysis in identifying and quantifying the mechanisms leading to voltage collapse.</p>

            <h2>DC Microgrids with Nested Nonlinear Distributed Control: Scalable Large-Signal Stability and Voltage Containment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cornelia Skaga, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz</p>
            <p>This paper investigates a cyber-physical DC microgrid employing a nonlinear distributed consensus-based control scheme for coordinated integration and management of distributed generating units within an expandable framework. Relying on nested primary andsecondary control loops; a (distributed) outer-loop and a (decentralized) inner-loop, the controller achieves proportional current sharing among all distributed generation units, while dynamically operating within predefined voltage limits. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis establishes a scalable global exponential stability certificate under some tuning conditions and sufficient time-scale separation between the control loops, based on singular perturbation theory. An optimization-based tuning strategy is then formulated to identify and subsequently diminish unstable operating conditions. In turn, various practical tuning strategies are introduced to provide stable operations while facilitating near-optimal proportional current sharing. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework and tuning approaches are finally supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid.</p>

            <h2>A Multi-Bound Robust Optimization Approach for Renewable-Based VPP Market Participation Considering Intra-Hourly Uncertainty Exposure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Nemati, Álvaro Ortega, Enrique Lobato, Luis Rouco</p>
            <p>With the ongoing transition of electricity markets worldwide from hourly to intra-hourly bidding, market participants--especially Renewable Energy Sources (RES)--gain improved opportunities to adjust energy and reserve schedules and to benefit from more accurate higher-resolution forecasts. However, this shift requires participants to update decision-making frameworks and to strengthen uncertainty management in order to fully exploit the new market potential. In particular, Renewable-Based Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) aggregating dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES must account for these changes through market-oriented scheduling methods that efficiently address multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, RES generation, and demand consumption. In this vein, this paper proposes a multi-bound robust optimization framework to simultaneously capture these uncertainties, explicitly incorporate intra-hourly variability, and differentiate the deviation levels (frequent, moderate deviations and rare, extreme ones) of uncertain parameters. The proposed approach yields less conservative and more implementable bidding and scheduling decisions, thus improving RVPP profitability in both energy and reserve markets. Simulation studies compare the proposed method with standard robust optimization and evaluate the operational, market-strategy, and economic impacts of quarter-hourly versus hourly market resolution. Results indicate that the normalized absolute differences, across different uncertainty-handling strategies, between hourly and 15-minute schedules are 18.0--34.2% for day-ahead traded energy, and 28.7--65.6% and 10.1--16.3% for upward and downward reserve traded in the secondary reserve market, respectively. Furthermore, relative to classic robust optimization, the proposed multi-bound approach increases profit by 24.9--49.2% across the considered strategies.</p>

            <h2>Fault Detection in Electrical Distribution System using Autoencoders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sidharthenee Nayak, Victor Sam Moses Babu, Chandrashekhar Narayan Bhende, Pratyush Chakraborty, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>In recent times, there has been considerable interest in fault detection within electrical power systems, garnering attention from both academic researchers and industry professionals. Despite the development of numerous fault detection methods and their adaptations over the past decade, their practical application remains highly challenging. Given the probabilistic nature of fault occurrences and parameters, certain decision-making tasks could be approached from a probabilistic standpoint. Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an approach for the modelling of dependent random variables using generalised polynomial chaos. This allows to write chance-constrained optimization problems with respect to a joint distribution modelling dependencies between different stochastic inputs. Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution. The paper exploits the problem structure and develops suitable transformations to ensure tractability. The proposed method is applied to a probabilistic power reserve procurement problem. The effectiveness of the method to capture dependencies is shown by comparing the approach with a standard approach considering independent random variables.</p>

            <h2>AFDM: Evolving OFDM Towards 6G+</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeon Seok Rou, Vincent Savaux, Zeping Sui, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Zilong Liu</p>
            <p>As the standardization of sixth generation (6G) wireless systems accelerates, there is a growing consensus in favor of evolutionary waveforms that offer new features while maximizing compatibility with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which underpins the 4G and 5G systems. This article presents affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) as a premier candidate for 6G, offering intrinsic robustness for both high-mobility communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in doubly dispersive channels, while maintaining a high degree of synergy with the legacy OFDM. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+).</p>

            <h2>A Lightweight Cubature Kalman Filter for Attitude and Heading Reference Systems Using Simplified Prediction Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunsei Yamagishi, Lei Jing</p>
            <p>Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRSs) are broadly applied wherever reliable orientation and motion sensing is required. In this paper, we present an improved Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) with lower computational cost while maintaining estimation accuracy, which is named "Kaisoku Cubature Kalman Filter (KCKF)". The computationally efficient equations of the KCKF are derived by simplifying those of the CKF, while preserving equivalent mathematical relations. The lightweight prediction equations in the KCKF are derived by expanding the summation terms in the CKF and simplifying the result. This paper shows that the KCKF requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than the CKF. The controlled experimental results show that the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 19% compared to the CKF on a high-performance computer, whereas the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 15% compared to the CKF on a low-cost single-board computer. In addition, the KCKF maintains the attitude estimation accuracy of the CKF.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation of Articulated Components in Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaowen Tao, Yinuo Wang, Haitao Ding, Yuanyang Qi, Ziyu Song</p>
            <p>With the growth of intelligent civil infrastructure and smart cities, operation and maintenance (O&M) increasingly requires safe, efficient, and energy-conscious robotic manipulation of articulated components, including access doors, service drawers, and pipeline valves. However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget. Experiments on representative O&M tasks demonstrate 16%-30% reductions in energy consumption, 16%-32% fewer steps to success, and consistently high success rates, indicating a scalable and sustainable solution for infrastructure O&M manipulation.</p>

            <h2>String-Level Ground Fault Localization for TN-Earthed Three-Phase Photovoltaic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanliang Li, Xun Gong, Reza Iravani, Bo Cao, Heng Liu, Ziming Chen</p>
            <p>The DC-side ground fault (GF) poses significant risks to three-phase TN-earthed photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the resulting high fault current can directly damage both PV inverters and PV modules. Once a fault occurs, locating the faulty string through manual string-by-string inspection is highly time-consuming and inefficient. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters.</p>

            <h2>Grid-ECO: Grid Aware Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Placement Optimizer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikram Panthee, Haoming Yang, Corey D. Harper, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>The paper develops a methodology, Grid-ECO, to optimally allocate electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) within a distribution feeder, while considering EV charging demand at census-level granularity. The underlying problem is NP-hard and requires satisfying nonlinear, nonconvex, three-phase unbalanced AC network constraints while including integer decision variables. Existing works cannot guarantee AC feasibility nor optimality of this problem without either i) relaxing the integer decision variable space or ii) convexifying AC constraints. Proposed Grid-ECO exactly solves the underlying mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) to near-zero optimality gap while prioritizing candidate locations based on grid voltage and current sensitivities. To solve the MINLP exactly, Grid-ECO exactly reformulates it into mixed-integer bilinear program (MIBLP), enabling global optimization using the spatial branch-and-bound algorithm (sBnB). To ensure computational tractability for large-scale feeders, we develop and include a novel presolving strategy based on Sequential Bound Tightening (SBT) with variable filtering and decomposition. Case studies demonstrate that Grid-ECO outperforms the off-the-shelf Gurobi sBnB solver by solving cases where no feasible solution is found within 167 hours. When feasible solution is found by off-the-shelf solver, Grid-ECO reduces solution time by up to 73\% and sBnB node exploration by up to 97\%, while achieving a 0\% optimality gap and guaranteed AC feasibility.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Network Prices for Prosumer-aware Hosting Capacity Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Zhang, Gregor Verbic, Frederik Geth, Mohsen Aldaadi, Rahmat Heidari, Julio Braslavsky</p>
            <p>The fast uptake of distributed energy resources (DERs) presents increasing challenges for managing hosting capacity in distribution networks. Existing solutions include direct load control, operating envelopes, and price-based control through dynamic energy prices. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often rely on assumed prosumer behavioural patterns and overlook prosumers' desire to retain control over their devices. Additionally, current fixed or Time-of-Use (ToU) prices are based on spatial and temporal averages, having limited impact on network conditions and DER operation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a bilevel optimisation framework that explicitly models prosumer decision-making in the design of dynamic network prices. The upper level represents the distribution system operator (DSO), setting network prices under cost-recovery and network constraints, while the lower level models prosumers optimising DER operation in response. The proposed framework preserves customer prerogative, enhances DER flexibility, and offers actionable insights for network hosting capacity management and the evolution of network tariff structures under high DER penetration.</p>

            <h2>Empirical Validation of a Dual-Defense Mechanism Reshaping Wholesale Electricity Price Dynamics in Singapore</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huang Zhenyu, Yuan Zhao</p>
            <p>While ex-ante screening and static price caps are global standards for mitigating price volatility, Singapore's electricity market employs a unique dual-defense mechanism integrating vesting contracts (VC) with a temporary price cap (TPC). Using high-frequency data from 2021 to 2024, this paper evaluates this mechanism and yields three primary findings. First, a structural trade-off exists within the VC framework: while VC quantity (VCQ) suppresses average prices, it paradoxically exacerbates instability via liquidity squeezes. Conversely, VC price (VCP) functions as a tail-risk anchor, dominating at extreme quantiles where VCQ efficacy wanes. Second, a structural break around the 2023 reform reveals a fundamental re-mapping of price dynamics; the previously positive pass-through from offer ratios to clearing prices was largely neutralized post-reform. Furthermore, diagnostics near the TPC threshold show no systematic evidence of strategic bid shading, confirming the TPC's operational integrity. Third, the dual-defense mechanism exhibits a critical synergy that resolves the volatility trade-off. The TPC reverses the volatility penalty of high VCQ, shifting the elasticity of conditional volatility from a destabilizing 0.636 to a stabilizing -0.213. This synergy enables the framework to enhance tail-risk control while eliminating liquidity-related stability costs. We conclude that this dual-defense mechanism successfully decouples price suppression from liquidity risks, thereby maximizing market stability.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Dynamic N-1 Screening: Identifying High-Risk Lines and Transformers After Common Faults</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayrton Almada, Laurent Pagnier, Igal Goldshtein, Saif R. Kazi, Michael (Misha)Chertkov</p>
            <p>Power system operators routinely perform N-1 contingency analysis, yet conventional tools provide limited guidance on which lines or transformers deserve heightened attention during fast post-fault transients. In particular, static screening does not reveal whether (1) the same faulted line repeatedly triggers severe downstream overloads, or (2) a specific transformer emerges as vulnerable across many distinct fault scenarios. This paper introduces a real-time dynamic N-1 screening framework that addresses this gap by estimating, for each counterfactual single-phase transmission fault, the probability of transient overcurrent on critical grid elements. The output is an operator-facing dashboard that ranks (a) faulted lines whose outages most frequently lead to dangerous transformer overloads, and (b) transformers that consistently overload across top-risk scenarios, both of which are actionable indicators for real-time situational awareness. The approach models post-fault electromechanical dynamics using a linear stochastic formulation of the swing equations with short-lived, fault-localized uncertainty, and combines analytic transient evaluation with cross-entropy based importance sampling to efficiently estimate rare but high-impact events. All N-1 contingencies are evaluated in parallel with linear computational complexity. The framework is demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system, where it reveals latent high-risk lines and transformers that remain invisible under deterministic dynamic or static N-1 analysis. Results show orders-of-magnitude computational speedup relative to brute-force Monte Carlo, enabling practical deployment within real-time operational cycles.</p>

            <p>We study capacity accreditation of resource-colocated large loads, defined as large demands such as data center and manufacturing loads colocated with behind-the-meter generation and storage resources, synchronously connected to the bulk power system, and capable of participating in the wholesale electricity market as an integrated unit. Because the accredited capacity of a resource portfolio is not equal to the sum of its individual resources' capacity values, we adopt a risk-based capacity accreditation framework to evaluate the combined reliability contribution of colocated resources. Grounded in the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) metric, the proposed capacity accreditation employs a convex optimization engine that jointly dispatches colocated resources to minimize reliability risk. We apply the developed methodology to a hydrogen manufacturing facility with colocated renewable generation, storage, and fuel cell resources.</p>

            <h2>Solving Conic Programs over Sparse Graphs using a Variational Quantum Approach: The Case of the Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>Conic programs arise broadly in physics, quantum information, machine learning, and engineering, many of which are defined over sparse graphs. Although such problems can be solved in polynomial time using classical interior-point solvers, the computational complexity scales unfavorably with graph size. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving conic programs, including quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) and semidefinite programs (SDPs). We encode primal variables via the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables via the probability mass function of a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. A primal-dual solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting the primal variables so that related observables are expressed in a banded form, enabling efficient measurement. The proposed framework is applied to the OPF problem, a large-scale optimization problem central to the operation of electric power systems. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p>

            <h2>Power Margin Ratio -- A Large-Signal System Strength Metric for Inverter-Based Resources-Dominated Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zitian Qiu, Yunjie Gu</p>
            <p>As the growing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in modern power systems, the system strength is decreasing. Due to the inherent difference in short-circuit capacity contributions of synchronous generators and inverters, the short-circuit ratio is not a one-size-fit-all metric to assess the system strength. Following the distinct dynamic behavior of the IBR in small- and large-signal disturbance, the system strength is separated accordingly. To address the large-signal system strength assessment, a control type-dependent metric, Power Margin Ratio (PMR), is proposed in this paper. PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power that can be injected to the system without causing any instability and the nominal power of the IBR. It can be obtained via power flow calculation with a modified algorithm. The theoretical foundation of PMR is established from the viewpoint of dynamical systems. PMR is identical to SCR for the single-plant-infinite-bus system, while presents advancement for multi-infeed power systems. Comprehensive case studies and discussions have validated that PMR reveals the large-signal system strength from a static perspective.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrej Stankovski, Blazhe Gjorgiev, James Ciyu Qin, Giovanni Sansavini</p>
            <p>Power system security assessments, e.g. via cascading outage models, often use operational set-points based on optimal power flow (OPF) dispatch. However, driven by cost minimization, OPF provides an ideal, albeit unrealistic, clearing of the generating units, disregarding the complex interactions among market participants. The security of the system, therefore, may be overestimated. To address this gap, we introduce a market model with a social-welfare-based day-ahead market clearing mechanism. The security implications are analyzed via Cascades, a cascading outage analysis framework. We apply this framework to the IEEE-118 bus system with three independent control zones. The results show that market dispatch leads to an increase in demand not served of up to 80% higher than OPF, highlighting a security overestimation. Operators can use this information to properly allocate reserves and perform efficient expansion planning strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kerd Topallaj, Colin McKerrell, Suraj Ramanathan, Ioannis Zografopoulos</p>
            <p>In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetration through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ambuj Gupta, Balarko Chaudhuri, Mark O'Malley</p>
            <p>The widely accepted definition of grid-forming (GFM) inverter states that it should behave as a (nearly) constant voltage source behind an impedance by maintaining a (nearly) constant internal voltage phasor in the sub-transient to transient time frame. Some system operators further mandate permissible ranges for this effective impedance. However, these specifications do not clearly define the location of the internal voltage source, and no systematic method exists to quantify its effective impedance for a black-box GFM model. To address this, we first compare the transient responses of an ideal voltage source and a GFM to show that an idealistic GFM maintains a (nearly) constant voltage across the filter capacitor, rather than at the inverter switches. Then we propose a systematic method to quantify the effective impedance of a GFM from its black-box model using frequency-domain admittance plots. Using standard PSCAD GFM models developed by NREL, we demonstrate that the GFM's equivalent impedance model captures the sub-transient response and static voltage stability limit reasonably accurately.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>To ensure frequency security in power systems, both the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency nadir (FN) must be explicitly accounted for in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF). However, accurately modeling sys-tem frequency dynamics through analytical formulations is chal-lenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity. To address this issue, deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized to capture the nonlinear mapping between system operating condi-tions and key frequency performance metrics. In this paper, a DNN-based frequency prediction model is developed and trained using the high-fidelity time-domain simulation data generated in PSCAD/EMTDC. The trained DNN is subsequently transformed into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) form and embedded into the FCOPF problem as additional con-straints to explicitly enforce frequency security, leading to the proposed DNN-FCOPF formulation. For benchmarking, two alternative models are considered: a conventional optimal power flow without frequency constraints and a linearized FCOPF in-corporating system-level RoCoF and FN constraints. The effec-tiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the solutions of these three models through extensive PSCAD/EMTDC time-domain simulations under various loading scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Solving the Post-Quantum Control Plane Bottleneck: Energy-Aware Cryptographic Scheduling in Open RAN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neha Gupta, Hamed Alimohammadi, Mohammad Shojafar, De Mi, Muhammad N.M. Bhutta</p>
            <p>The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) offers flexibility and innovation but introduces unique security vulnerabilities, particularly from cryptographically relevant quantum computers. While Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is the primary scalable defence, its computationally intensive handshakes create a significant bottleneck for the RAN control plane, posing sustainability challenges. This paper proposes an energy-aware framework to solve this PQC bottleneck, ensuring quantum resilience without sacrificing operational energy efficiency. The system employs an O-RAN aligned split: a Crypto Policy rApp residing in the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT) RIC defines the strategic security envelope (including PQC suites), while a Security Operations Scheduling (SOS) xApp in the Near-RT RIC converts these into tactical timing and placement intents. Cryptographic enforcement remains at standards-compliant endpoints: the Open Fronthaul utilizes Media Access Control Security (MACsec) at the O-DU/O-RU, while the xhaul (midhaul and backhaul) utilizes IP Security (IPsec) at tunnel terminators. The SOS xApp reduces PQC overhead by batching non-urgent handshakes, prioritizing session resumption, and selecting parameters that meet slice SLAs while minimizing joules per secure connection. We evaluate the architecture via a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) using 3GPP-aligned traffic profiles and verified hardware benchmarks from literature. Results show that intelligent scheduling can reduce per-handshake energy by approximately 60 percent without violating slice latency targets.</p>

            <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we consider four important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and task assignment, and propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. We first establish a fuzzy-enhanced adaptive reinforcement proportional-integral-derivative control model to control the attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in another, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing mainstream approaches.</p>

            <p>The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Policy Adaptation for Voltage Control Under Unknown Topology Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Feng, Yuanyuan Shi, Deepjyoti Deka</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for designing voltage control policies, but their performance often degrades under changing system conditions such as topology reconfigurations and load variations. We introduce a topology-aware online policy optimization framework that leverages data-driven estimation of voltage-reactive power sensitivities to achieve efficient policy adaptation. Exploiting the sparsity of topology-switching events, where only a few lines change at a time, our method efficiently detects topology changes and identifies the affected lines and parameters, enabling fast and accurate sensitivity updates without recomputing the full sensitivity matrix. The estimated sensitivity is subsequently used for online policy optimization of a pre-trained neural-network-based RL controller. Simulations on both the IEEE 13-bus and SCE 56-bus systems demonstrate over 90 percent line identification accuracy, using only 15 data points. The proposed method also significantly improves voltage regulation performance compared with non-adaptive policies and adaptive policies that rely on regression-based online optimization methods for sensitivity estimation.</p>

            <p>The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.</p>

            <h2>Operator-Based Information Theory for Imaging: Entropy, Capacity, and Irreversibility in Physical Measurement Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Wood</p>
            <p>Imaging systems are commonly described using resolution, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio, but these quantities do not provide a general account of how physical transformations affect the flow of information. This paper introduces an operator-based formulation of information theory for imaging. The approach models the imaging chain as a composition of bounded operators acting on functions, and characterises information redistribution using the spectral properties of these operators. Three measures are developed. Operator entropy quantifies how an operator distributes energy across its singular spectrum. Operator information capacity describes the number of modes that remain recoverable above a noise-dependent threshold. An irreversibility index measures the information lost through suppression or elimination of modes and captures the accumulation of information loss under operator composition. The framework applies to linear, nonlinear, and stochastic operators and does not depend on the specific imaging modality. Analytical examples show how attenuation, blur, and sampling affect entropy, capacity, and irreversibility in different ways. The results provide a general structure for analysing the physical limits of imaging and form the basis for subsequent work on information geometry, spatiotemporal budgets, nonlinear channels, and reconstruction algorithms.</p>

            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly deployed, yet range limitations remain a key barrier. Improving energy efficiency via advanced control is therefore essential, and emerging vehicle automation offers a promising avenue. However, many existing strategies rely on indirect surrogates because linking power consumption to control inputs is difficult. We propose a neural-network (NN) identifier that learns this mapping online and couples it with an actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) framework to generate optimal control commands. The resulting actor-critic-identifier architecture removes dependence on explicit models relating total power, recovered energy, and inputs, while maintaining accurate speed tracking and maximizing efficiency. Update laws are derived using Lyapunov stability analysis, and performance is validated in simulation. Compared to a traditional controller, the method increases total energy recovery by 12.84%, indicating strong potential for improving EV energy efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasper Juchem, Mia Loccufier</p>
            <p>Gyroscopic interconnections enable redistribution of energy among degrees of freedom while preserving passivity and total energy, and they play a central role in controlled Lagrangian methods and IDA-PBC. Yet their quantitative effect on transient energy exchange and subsystem performance is not well characterised. We study a conservative mechanical system with constant skew-symmetric velocity coupling. Its dynamics are integrable and evolve on invariant two-tori, whose projections onto subsystem phase planes provide geometric description of energy exchange. When the ratio of normal-mode frequencies is rational, these projections become closed resonant Lissajous curves, enabling structured analysis of subsystem trajectories. To quantify subsystem behaviour, we introduce the inscribed-radius metric: the radius of the largest origin-centred circle contained in a projected trajectory. This gives a lower bound on attainable subsystem energy and acts as an internal performance measure. We derive resonance conditions and develop an efficient method to compute or certify the inscribed radius without time-domain simulation. Our results show that low-order resonances can strongly restrict energy depletion through phase-locking, whereas high-order resonances recover conservative bounds. These insights lead to an explicit interconnection-shaping design framework for both energy absorption and containment control strategies, while taking responsiveness into account.</p>

            <p>Ensuring small-signal stability in power systems with a high share of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is hampered by two factors: (i) device and network parameters are often uncertain or completely unknown, and (ii) brute-force enumeration of all topologies is computationally intractable. These challenges motivate plug-and-play (PnP) certificates that verify stability locally yet hold globally. Passivity is an attractive property because it guarantees stability under feedback and network interconnections; however, strict passivity rarely holds for practical controllers such as Grid Forming Inverters (GFMs) employing P-Q droop. This paper extends the passivity condition by constructing a dynamic, frequency-dependent multiplier that enables PnP stability certification of each component based solely on its admittance, without requiring any modification to the controller design. The multiplier is parameterised as a linear filter whose coefficients are tuned under a passivity goal. Numerical results for practical droop gains confirm the PnP rules, substantially enlarging the certified stability region while preserving the decentralised, model-agnostic nature of passivity-based PnP tests.</p>

            <p>Urban energy systems face increasing challenges due to high penetration of renewable energy sources, extreme weather events, and other high-impact, low-probability disruptions. This project proposes a community-centered, open-access framework to enhance the resilience and reliability of urban power and gas networks by integrating microgrid partitioning, mobile energy storage deployment, and data-driven risk assessment. The approach involves converting passive distribution networks into active, self-healing microgrids using distributed energy resources and remotely controlled switches to enable flexible reconfiguration during normal and emergency operations. To address uncertainties from intermittent renewable generation and variable load, an adjustable interval optimization method combined with a column and constraint generation algorithm is developed, providing robust planning solutions without requiring probabilistic information. Additionally, a real-time online risk assessment tool is proposed, leveraging 25 multi-dimensional indices including load, grid status, resilient resources, emergency response, and meteorological factors to support operational decision-making during extreme events. The framework also optimizes the long-term sizing and allocation of mobile energy storage units while incorporating urban traffic data for effective routing during emergencies. Finally, a novel time-dependent resilience and reliability index is introduced to quantify system performance under diverse operating conditions. The proposed methodology aims to enable resilient, efficient, and adaptable urban energy networks capable of withstanding high-impact disruptions while maximizing operational and economic benefits.</p>

            <p>Deterministic frequency deviations (DFDs) are systematic and predictable excursions of grid frequency that arise from synchronized generation ramps induced by electricity market scheduling. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the European day-ahead market reform of 1 October 2025, which replaced hourly trading blocks with quarter-hourly blocks, on DFDs in the Central European synchronous area. Using publicly available frequency measurements, we compare periods before and after the reform based on daily frequency profiles, indicators characterizing frequency deviations, principal component analysis, Fourier-based functional data analysis, and power spectral density analysis. We show that the reform substantially reduces characteristic hourly frequency deviations and suppresses dominant spectral components at hourly and half-hourly time scales, while quarter-hourly structures gain relative importance. While the likelihood of large frequency deviations decreases overall, reductions for extreme events are less clear and depend on the metric used. Our results demonstrate that market design reforms can effectively mitigate systematic frequency deviations, but also highlight that complementary technical and regulatory measures are required to further reduce large frequency excursions in low-inertia power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinhoo Kang, Sangwook Kim, Sehyun Yun</p>
            <p>The transition toward low-inertia power systems demands modeling frameworks that provide not only accurate state predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities for control. While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NODE serves as a viable data-driven surrogate when governing equations are unavailable.</p>

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Interference Suppression in RIS-Aided Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pujitha Mamillapalli, Shikhar Verma, Tiago Koketsu Rodrigues, Abhinav Kumar</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks envision ubiquitous connectivity through space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), where high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and satellites complement terrestrial systems to provide wide-area, low-latency coverage. However, the rapid growth of terrestrial devices intensifies spectrum sharing between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments, resulting in severe cross-tier interference. In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed DDPG framework optimizes the HAPS beamforming weights to form spatial nulls toward interference sources while maintaining robust links to the desired signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG framework consistently outperforms conventional ZF beamforming among different RIS configurations, achieving up to \(11.3\%\) throughput improvement for a \(4\times4\) RIS configuration, validating its adaptive capability to enhance spectral efficiency in dynamic HAPS-based SAGINs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson</p>
            <p>The impact of routine smaller outages on distribution system customers in terms of customer minutes interrupted can be tracked using conventional reliability indices. However, the customer minutes interrupted in large blackout events are extremely variable, and this makes it difficult to quantify the customer impact of these extreme events with resilience metrics. We solve this problem with the System Average Large Event Duration Index SALEDI that logarithmically transforms the customer minutes interrupted. We explain how this new resilience metric works, compare it with alternatives, quantify its statistical accuracy, and illustrate its practical use with standard outage data from five utilities.</p>

            <h2>Trustworthiness Layer for Foundation Models in Power Systems: Application for N-k Contingency Assessment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio Alcántara, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
            <p>This work introduces for the first time, to our knowledge, a trustworthiness layer for foundation models in power systems. Using stratified conformal prediction, we devise adaptive, statistically valid confidence bounds for each output of a foundation model. For regression, this allows users to obtain an uncertainty estimate for each output; for screening, it supports conservative decisions that minimize false negatives. We demonstrate our method by enhancing GridFM, the first open-source Foundation Model for power systems, with statistically valid prediction intervals instead of heuristic error margins. We apply it for N-k contingency assessment, a combinatorial NP-Hard problem. We show that trustworthy GridFM can offer richer and more accurate information than DC Power Flow, having 2x-3x higher precision, while running up to 18x faster than AC Power Flow for systems up to 118 buses. Moving a step further, we also examine the ability of trustworthy GridFM to generalize to unseen high-order contingencies: through a rigorous analysis, we assess how a model trained on N-1 or N-2 outages extrapolates to unseen contingencies up to N-5.</p>

            <h2>Residential Peak Load Reduction via Direct Load Control under Limited Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Kaiser, Gustavo Valverde, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Thermostatically controlled loads and electric vehicles offer flexibility to reduce power peaks in low-voltage distribution networks. This flexibility can be maximized if the devices are coordinated centrally, given some level of information about the controlled devices. In this paper, we propose novel optimization-based control schemes with prediction capabilities that utilize limited information from heat pumps, electric water heaters, and electric vehicles. The objective is to flatten the total load curve seen by the distribution transformer by restricting the times at which the available flexible loads are allowed to operate, subject to the flexibility constraints of the loads to preserve customers' comfort. The original scheme was tested in a real-world setup, considering both winter and summer days. The pilot results confirmed the technical feasibility but also informed the design of an improved version of the controller. Computer simulations using the adjusted controller show that, compared to the original formulation, the improved scheme achieves greater peak reductions in summer. Additionally, comparisons were made with an ideal controller, which assumes perfect knowledge of the inflexible load profile, the models of the controlled devices, the hot water and space heating demand, and future electric vehicle charging sessions. The proposed scheme with limited information achieves almost half of the potential average daily peak reduction that the ideal controller with perfect knowledge would achieve.</p>

            <h2>NOMA-Assisted Multi-BS MEC Networks for Delay-Sensitive and Computation-Intensive IoT Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuang Chen, Fengqian Guo, Chang Wu, Mingyu Peng, Hancheng Lu, Chang Wen Chen</p>
            <p>The burgeoning and ubiquitous deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape struggles with ultra-low latency demands for computation-intensive tasks in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose an innovative uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-base station (BS) mobile edge computing (BS-MEC) network tailored for massive IoT connectivity. To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed EPG-JDM algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms and classic heuristic algorithms, yielding performance improvements of up to 19.3% and 14.7% in terms of total delay and power consumption, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Gu, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Resolution and Chroma Subsampling for Energy-Efficient Video Coding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amritha Premkumar, Christian Herglotz</p>
            <p>Conventional video encoders typically employ a fixed chroma subsampling format, such as YUV420, which may not optimally reflect variations in chroma detail across different types of content. This can lead to suboptimal chroma quality and inefficiencies in bitrate allocation. We propose an Adaptive Resolution-Chroma Subsampling (ARCS) framework that jointly optimizes spatial resolution and chroma subsampling to balance perceptual quality and decoding efficiency. ARCS selects an optimal (resolution, chroma format) pair for each bitrate by maximizing a composite quality-complexity objective, while enforcing monotonicity constraints to ensure smooth transitions between representations. Experimental results using x265 show that, compared to a fixed-format encoding (YUV444), on average, ARCS achieves a 13.48 % bitrate savings and a 62.18 % reduction in decoding time, which we use as a proxy for the decoding energy, to yield the same colorVideoVDP score. The proposed framework introduces chroma adaptivity as a new control dimension for energy-efficient video streaming.</p>

            <h2>A hard-constrained NN learning framework for rapidly restoring AC-OPF from DC-OPF</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kejun Chen, Bernard Knueven, Wesley Jones</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a hard-constrained unsupervised learning framework for rapidly solving the non-linear and non-convex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem in real-time operation. Without requiring ground-truth AC-OPF solutions, feasibility and optimality are ensured through a properly designed learning environment and training loss. Inspired by residual learning, the neural network (NN) learns the correction mapping from the DC-OPF solution to the active power setpoints of the generators through re-dispatch. A subsequent optimization model is utilized to restore the optimal AC-OPF solution, and the resulting projection difference is employed as the training loss. A replay buffer is utilized to enhance learning efficiency by fully leveraging past data pairs. The optimization model is cast as a differentiable optimization layer, where the gradient is derived by applying the implicit function theorem to the KKT conditions at the optimal solution. Tested on IEEE-118 and PEGASE-9241 bus systems, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NN can obtain strictly feasible and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational time compared to conventional optimization solvers. In addition, aided by the updated DC-OPF solution under varying topologies, the trained NN, together with the PF solver, can rapidly find the corresponding AC solution. The proposed method achieves a $40\times$ time speedup, while maintaining an average constraint violation on the order of $10^{-4}$ and an optimization gap below $1\%$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Venkata Rajesh Chundru, Shreshta Rajakumar Deshpande, Stanislav A Gankov</p>
            <p>The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential. The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization. This review will identify potential synergies, research gaps, and emerging trends, paving the way for future innovations in BESS management and deployment strategies.</p>

            <h2>Exposing Barriers to Flexibility Aggregation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Churkin, Wangwei Kong, Pierluigi Mancarella, Eduardo A. Martínez Ceseña</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DER) offers new opportunities for distribution system operators (DSO) to improve network operation through flexibility services. To utilise flexible resources, various DER flexibility aggregation methods have been proposed, such as the concept of aggregated P-Q flexibility areas. Yet, many existing studies assume perfect coordination among DER and rely on single-phase power flow analysis, thus overlooking barriers to flexibility aggregation in real unbalanced systems. To quantify the impact of these barriers, this paper proposes a three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) framework for P-Q flexibility assessment, implemented as an open-source Julia tool this http URL. The framework explicitly accounts for voltage unbalance and imperfect coordination among DER in low voltage (LV) distribution networks. Simulations on an illustrative 5-bus system and a real 221-bus LV network in the UK reveal that over 30% of the theoretical aggregated flexibility potential can be lost due to phase unbalance and lack of coordination across phases. These findings highlight the need for improved flexibility aggregation tools applicable to real unbalanced distribution networks.</p>

            <p>We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal scheduling of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the scheduling decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.</p>

            <p>While the rapid expansion of data centers poses challenges for power grids, it also offers new opportunities as potentially flexible loads. Existing power system research often abstracts data centers as aggregate resources, while computer system research primarily focuses on optimizing GPU energy efficiency and largely ignores the grid impacts of optimized GPU power consumption. To bridge this gap, we develop a GPU-to-Grid framework that couples device-level GPU control with power system objectives. We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems. Our key insight is that reducing GPU power consumption alleviates violations of lower voltage limits, while increasing GPU power mitigates violations near upper voltage limits in distribution systems; this runs counter to the common belief that minimizing GPU power consumption is always beneficial to power grids.</p>

            <p>Inverse problems are often ill-posed and require optimization schemes with strong stability and convergence guarantees. While learning-based approaches such as deep unrolling and meta-learning achieve strong empirical performance, they typically lack explicit control over descent and curvature, limiting robustness. We propose a learned Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework for inverse problems within a bilevel optimization setting. Instead of learning a full optimizer, we learn a structured curvature majorant that governs each MM step while preserving classical MM descent guarantees. The majorant is parameterized by a lightweight recurrent neural network and explicitly constrained to satisfy valid MM conditions. For cosine-similarity losses, we derive explicit curvature bounds yielding diagonal majorants. When analytic bounds are unavailable, we rely on efficient Hessian-vector product-based spectral estimation to automatically upper-bound local curvature without forming the Hessian explicitly. Experiments on EEG source imaging demonstrate improved accuracy, stability, and cross-dataset generalization over deep-unrolled and meta-learning baselines.</p>

            <p>The widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV), electric vehicles (EVs), and stationary energy storage systems (ESS) in households increases system complexity while simultaneously offering new opportunities for energy regulation. However, effectively coordinating these resources under uncertainties remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel home energy management framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can jointly minimise energy expenditure and battery degradation while guaranteeing occupant comfort and EV charging requirements. Distinct from existing studies, we explicitly account for the heterogeneous degradation characteristics of stationary and EV batteries in the optimisation, alongside stochastic user behaviour regarding arrival time, departure time, and driving distance. The energy scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and solved using a Lagrangian soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn optimal control policies that enforce physical constraints, including indoor temperature bounds and target EV state of charge upon departure, despite stochastic uncertainties. Numerical simulations over a one-year horizon demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in satisfying physical constraints while eliminating thermal oscillations and achieving significant economic benefits. Specifically, the method reduces the cumulative operating cost substantially compared to two standard rule-based baselines while simultaneously decreasing battery degradation costs by 8.44%.</p>

            <p>A notable challenge in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is the time required to fully charge the battery, which can range from 15 minutes to 2-3 hours. This idle period, however, presents an opportunity to offer time-consuming or data-intensive services such as vehicular software updates. ISO 15118 referred to the concept of Value-Added Services (VAS) in the charging scenario, but it remained underexplored in the literature. Our paper addresses this gap by proposing \acronym, the first EV charger compute architecture that supports secure on-charger universal applications with upstream and downstream communication. The architecture covers the end-to-end hardware/software stack, including standard API for vehicles and IT infrastructure. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of \acronym by employing and evaluating three suggested value-added services: vehicular software updates, security information and event management (SIEM), and secure payments. The results demonstrate significant reductions in bandwidth utilization and latency, as well as high throughput, which supports this novel concept and suggests a promising business model for Electric Vehicle charging station operation.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an LLM-driven, end-to-end workflow that addresses the lack of automation and intelligence in power system transient stability assessment (TSA). The proposed agentic framework integrates large language models (LLMs) with a professional simulator (ANDES) to automatically generate and filter disturbance scenarios from natural language, and employs an LLM-driven Neural Network Design (LLM-NND) pipeline to autonomously design and optimize TSA models through performance-guided, closed-loop feedback. On the IEEE 39-bus system, the LLM-NND models achieve 93.71% test accuracy on four-class TSA with only 4.78M parameters, while maintaining real-time inference latency (less than 0.95 ms per sample). Compared with a manually designed DenseNet (25.9M parameters, 80.05% accuracy), the proposed approach jointly improves accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy among domain-grounded retrieval, reasoning augmentation, and feedback mechanisms is essential for robust automation. The results demonstrate that LLM agents can reliably accelerate TSA research from scenario generation and data acquisition to model design and interpretation, offering a scalable paradigm that is readily extensible to other power system tasks such as optimal power flow, fault analysis, and market operations.</p>

            <p>Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.</p>

            <h2>Estimation of Cell-to-Cell Variation and State of Health for Battery Modules with Parallel-Connected Cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinan Zhou, Jing Sun</p>
            <p>Estimating cell-to-cell variation (CtCV) and state of health (SoH) for battery modules with parallel-connected cells is challenging when only module-level signals are measurable and individual cell behaviors remain unobserved. Although progress has been made in SoH estimation, CtCV estimation remains unresolved in the literature. This paper proposes a unified framework that accurately estimates both CtCV and SoH for modules using only module-level information extracted from incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA). With the proposed framework, CtCV and SoH estimations can be decoupled into two separate tasks, allowing each to be solved with dedicated algorithms without mutual interference and providing greater design flexibility. The framework also exhibits strong versatility in accommodating different CtCV metrics, highlighting its general-purpose nature. Experimental validation on modules with three parallel-connected cells demonstrates that the proposed framework can systematically select optimal module-level features for CtCV and SoH estimations, deliver accurate CtCV and SoH estimates with high confidence and low computational complexity, remain effective across different C-rates, and be suitable for onboard implementation.</p>

            <h2>Fast Diffusion with Physics-Correction for ACOPF</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shashank Shekhar, Abhinav Karn, Kris Keshav, Shivam Bansal, Parikshit Pareek</p>
            <p>Generating large-scale, physically consistent AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) datasets is essential for modern data-driven power system applications. The central challenge lies in balancing solution accuracy with computational efficiency. Recent diffusion-based generative models produce high-quality samples; however, their slow sampling procedures limit practical scalability. In this work, we argue that exact physical feasibility is ultimately enforced by power flow solvers or projection steps, and therefore the generative model only needs to produce good initializations rather than perfectly feasible solutions. Based on this insight, we propose a fast diffusion framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) combined with physics-guided corrections during sampling. The proposed method replaces slow stochastic refinement with a small number of deterministic steps and explicit constraint guidance. Experiments on IEEE 6-, 24-, and 118-bus systems show that our approach achieves up to 20 times faster sampling than standard diffusion models while maintaining comparable statistical accuracy and physical consistency. This makes the method well suited for scalable OPF dataset generation and practical power system learning tasks. We release the implementation code at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.</p>

            <p>The last mile of the distribution grid is crucial for a successful energy transition, as more low-carbon technology like photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and electric vehicle chargers connect to the low-voltage grid. Despite considerable challenges in operation and planning, researchers often lack access to suitable low-voltage grid data. To address this, we present the FeederBW dataset with data recorded by the German distribution system operator Netze BW. It offers real-world energy data from 200 low-voltage feeders over two years (2023-2025) with weather information and detailed metadata, including changes in low-carbon technology installations. The dataset includes feeder-specific details such as the number of housing units, installed power of low-carbon technology, and aggregated industrial energy data. Furthermore, high photovoltaic feed-in and one-minute temporal resolution makes the dataset unique. FeederBW supports various applications, including machine learning for load forecasting, conducting non-intrusive load monitoring, generating synthetic data, and analyzing the interplay between weather, feeder measurements, and metadata. The dataset reveals insightful patterns and clearly reflects the growing impact of low-carbon technology on low-voltage grids.</p>

            <h2>An End-to-End Approach for Microgrid Probabilistic Forecasting and Robust Operation via Decision-focused Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingwei Cao, Yan Xu</p>
            <p>High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lasse Kötz, Jonas Sjöberg, Knut Åkesson</p>
            <p>We present a falsification framework that integrates learned surrogate dynamics with optimal control to efficiently generate counterexamples for cyber-physical systems specified in signal temporal logic (STL). The unknown system dynamics are identified using neural ODEs, while known a-priori structure is embedded directly into the model, reducing data requirements. The learned neural ODE is converted into an analytical form via symbolic regression, enabling fast and interpretable trajectory optimization. Falsification is cast as minimizing STL robustness over input trajectories; negative robustness yields candidate counterexamples, which are validated on the original system. Spurious traces are iteratively used to refine the surrogate, while true counterexamples are returned as final results. Experiments on ARCH-COMP 2024 benchmarks show that this method requires orders of magnitude fewer experiments of the system under test than optimization-based approaches that do not model system dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muddasir Rahim, Soumaya Cherkaoui</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications necessitates robust resource allocation in future sixth-generation (6G) networks, particularly at the upper mid-band (7-15 GHz, FR3). This paper presents a novel intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS)-assisted framework combining terrestrial IRS (TIRS) and aerial IRS (AIRS) mounted on low-altitude platform stations, to ensure reliable connectivity under severe line-of-sight (LoS) blockages. Distinguishing itself from prior work restricted to terrestrial IRS and mmWave and THz bands, this work targets the FR3 spectrum, the so-called Golden Band for 6G. The joint beamforming and user association (JBUA) problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), solved through problem decomposition, zero-forcing beamforming, and a stable matching algorithm. Comprehensive simulations show our method approaches exhaustive search performance with significantly lower complexity, outperforming existing greedy and random baselines. These results provide a scalable blueprint for real-world 6G deployments, supporting massive IoT connectivity in challenging environments.</p>

            <h2>Reliable IoT Communications in 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks with Dual RIS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muddasir Rahim, Soumaya Cherkaoui</p>
            <p>The increasing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications has accelerated the need for robust resource allocation in sixth-generation (6G) networks. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted upper mid-band communication framework. To ensure robust connectivity under severe line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, we use a two-tier RIS structure comprising terrestrial RISs (TRISs) and high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-mounted RISs (HRISs). To maximize network sum rate, we formulate a joint beamforming, power allocation, and IoT device association (JBPDA) problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The formulated MINLP problem is challenging to solve directly; therefore, we tackle it via a decomposition approach. The zero-forcing (ZF) technique is used to optimize the beamforming matrix, a closed-form expression for power allocation is derived, and a stable matching-based algorithm is proposed for device-RIS association based on achievable data rates. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme approaches the performance of exhaustive search (ES) while exhibiting substantially lower complexity, and it consistently outperforms greedy search (GS) and random search (RS) baselines. Moreover, the proposed scheme converges much faster than the ES scheme.</p>

            <p>Hybrid distribution transformers (HDTs) integrate conventional transformers with partially rated power electronic converters to improve power quality, enable advanced ancillary services and increase penetration of renewable energy sources in the national power grid. In this paper, we present an averaged mathematical model of a three-phase HDT equipped with two back-to-back voltage source converters connected in a series-shunt configuration. Cascaded PI controllers are designed in the synchronously rotating dq0 reference frame to regulate load voltage, compensate reactive power, achieve grid frequency regulation, and perform load phase balancing. Simulation results implemented in Python confirm that these simple yet effective control mechanisms allow HDTs to offer simultaneous grid services without introducing complexity.

            <p>The rapid growth of hyperscale data centers driven by Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence workloads has introduced new challenges for power systems. These facilities experience abrupt power variations during model training and check-point-saving events, causing voltage deviations and frequency disturbances. Moreover, they operate as passive loads that draw power without offering any grid support. This paper presents an integrated architecture that combines Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) within data centers using Grid-Forming inverters to provide active grid-support functions. Simulation results through MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate accurate power reference tracking under dynamic loading, with eight coordinated BESS units supplying instantaneous power during training and saving conditions. Under single-phase voltage depression near the data center bus, the BESS delivered reactive power support similar to a Static Synchronous Compensator. During grid disconnection, seamless islanded operation was achieved with stable voltage, frequency, and continuous power delivery at the data center bus.</p>

Optimal sizing of CEH components is therefore a critical investment decision, yet challenging because design choices depend strongly on operational dynamics. This work presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for the optimal sizing of CEH components, using a co-design approach that jointly optimizes component sizing and operational decisions.

            <h2>Harnessing Flexible Spatial and Temporal Data Center Workloads for Grid Regulation Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingrui Fan, Junbo Zhao</p>
            <p>Data centers (DCs) are increasingly recognized as flexible loads that can support grid frequency regulation. Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently.</p>

            <h2>Learning-Augmented Power System Operations: A Unified Optimization View</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wangkun Xu, Zhongda Chu, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy, traditional physics-based power system operation faces growing challenges in achieving economic efficiency, stability, and robustness. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex system dynamics to address these challenges. However, existing ML designs are often developed in isolation and lack systematic integration with established operational decision frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced Lap-So). From a native mathematical optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to unify traditionally siloed power system tasks such as forecasting, operation, and control. The framework jointly optimizes machine learning and physics-based models at both the training and inference stages. Then, a complete set of design metrics is introduced to quantify and evaluate the impact of ML models on the existing decision-makings. These metrics facilitate a deeper understanding of representative applications such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF). Moreover, LAPSO is inherently extensible to emerging learning paradigms that integrate forecasting, operation, and control in a closed loop. It also enables the systematic identification and mitigation of different sources and timings of uncertainty from Bayesian perspective. Finally, a dedicated Python package \texttt{lapso} is developed to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandesh Rao Mattu, Nishant Mehrotra, Robert Calderbank</p>
            <p>This letter describes how to improve performance of cellular systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling (shaping) with low-density parity check (LDPC) coding for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. We focus on improving performance at the cell edge, where the 5G standard specifies a suite of LDPC codes with different rates that are applied to 4-QAM. We employ the method of shaping on rings which adds to the transmission rate as it shapes the input distribution. We double the size of the $4$-QAM constellation by introducing a second shell of signal points, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects the high energy shell less frequently than the low energy shell. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We employ rate $1/2$ LDPC coding and select the rate of the shaping code to match that of rate $3/4$ LDPC coding using $4$-QAM. We present simulation results for a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. When we choose an LDPC code from the 5G suite to match the BER performance of rate $1/2$ LDPC coding with shaping we show that transmission rate can be improved by $20 $%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismaeel Babur, Jane Macfarlane</p>
            <p>The widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) holds promise for mitigating emission-related health impacts, particularly for low-income communities disproportionately affected by exposure to traffic-related air pollution. However, designing effective charging infrastructure necessitates a regional modeling approach that accounts for the inherent cross-jurisdictional nature of mobility patterns. This study underscores the importance of regional modeling in optimizing charging station deployment and evaluating the environmental justice implications for equity priority communities. We present a large-scale regional transportation modeling analysis leveraging Mobiliti, a cloud-based platform that employs parallel discrete event simulation to enable rapid computation. Our approach identifies the spatial demand density for charging infrastructure by analyzing over 19 million trips in the San Francisco Bay Area and determining the threshold points where BEVs may require charging across a typical day. By transitioning these trips that originate outside equity priority communities to BEVs, we quantify the potential emission reductions within these vulnerable areas. The regional modeling framework captures the complex interactions between travel behavior, vehicle characteristics, and charging needs, while accounting for the interconnectivity of infrastructure across municipal boundaries. This study demonstrates the critical role of regional modeling in designing equitable BEV charging networks that address environmental justice concerns. The findings inform strategies for deploying charging infrastructure that maximizes accessibility, minimizes range anxiety, and prioritizes the health and well-being of communities disproportionately burdened by transportation emissions.</p>

            <p>The complex electrochemical behavior of lithium-ion batteries results in non-linear dynamics and appropriate modeling of this non-linear dynamical system is of interest for better management and control. In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.</p>

            <p>Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation. Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction. To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.</p>

            <p>The deployment of medium-range battery electric aircraft is a promising pathway to improve the environmental footprint of air mobility. Yet such a deployment would be accompanied by significant electric power requirements at airports due to aircraft charging. Given the growing prevalence of electric vehicles and their bi-directional charging capabilities--so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G)--we study energy buffer capabilities of parked electric vehicles to alleviate pressure on grid connections. To this end, we present energy management strategies for airports providing cost-optimal apron and landside V2G charge scheduling. Specifically, we first formulate the optimal energy management problem of joint aircraft charging and landside V2G coordination as a linear program, whereby we use partial differential equations to model the aggregated charging dynamics of the electric vehicle fleet. Second, we consider a shuttle flight network with a single hub of a large Dutch airline, real-world grid prices, and synthetic parking garage occupancy data to test our framework. Our results show that V2G at even a single airport can indeed reduce energy costs to charge the aircraft fleet: Compared to a baseline scenario without V2G, the proposed concept yields cost savings of up to 32%, depending on the schedule and amount of participating vehicles, and has other potential beneficial effects on the local power grid, e.g., the reduction of potential power peaks.</p>

            <p>Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this paper, we explore an MA-aided DFRC system that utilizes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance signal coverage for communications in dead zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance in practical DFRC environments, we propose a unified robust transceiver design framework aimed at maximizing the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a cluttered environment. Our approach jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, receive filtering, antenna placement, and RIS reflecting coefficients under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both sensing and communication channels. To deal with the channel uncertainty-constrained issue, we leverage the convex hull method to transform the primal problem into a more tractable form. We then introduce a two-layer block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating fractional programming (FP), successive convex approximation (SCA), S-Lemma, and penalty techniques to reformulate it into a series of semidefinite program (SDP) subproblems that can be efficiently solved. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the convergence and computational complexity for the proposed design framework. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, and show that the MA-based design framework can significantly enhance the radar SINR performance while achieving an effective balance between the radar and communication performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingguan Liu, Cong Chen, Xiaomeng Ai, Jiakun Fang, Jinsong Wang, Jinyu Wen</p>
            <p>Distributed energy storage devices can be pooled and coordinated by aggregators to participate in power system operations and market clearings. This requires representing a massive device population as a single, tractable surrogate that is computationally efficient, accurate, and compatible with market participation requirements. However, surrogate identification is challenging due to heterogeneity, nonconvexity, and high dimensionality of storage devices. To address these challenges, this paper develops a mean-field learning framework for storage aggregation. We interpret aggregation as the average behavior of a large storage population and show that, as the population grows, aggregate performance converges to a unique, convex mean-field limit, enabling tractable population-level modeling. This convexity further yields a price-responsive characterization of aggregate storage behavior and allows us to bound the mean-field approximation error. Leveraging these results, we construct a convex surrogate model that approximates the aggregate behavior of large storage populations and can be embedded directly into power system operations and market clearing. Surrogate parameter identification is formulated as an optimization problem using historical market price-response data, and we adopt a gradient-based algorithm for efficient learning procedure. Case studies validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in approximation accuracy, data efficiency, and profit outcomes.</p>

            <p>The growing prevalence of extreme weather events driven by climate change poses significant challenges to power system resilience. Infrastructure damage and prolonged power outages highlight the urgent need for effective grid-hardening strategies. While some measures provide long-term protection against specific hazards, they can become counterproductive under conflicting threats. In this work, we develop an adaptive two-stage stochastic optimization framework to support dynamic decision-making for hardening critical grid components under multiple hazard exposures. Unlike traditional approaches, our model adapts to evolving climate conditions, enabling more resilient investment strategies. Furthermore, we integrate long-term (undergrounding) and short-term (vegetation management) hardening actions to jointly minimize total system costs. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing outage and repair costs while enhancing the adaptability and robustness of grid infrastructure planning.</p>

            <h2>Surrogate model of a HVAC system for PV self-consumption maximisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. da Costa Paulo, N. Aginako, J. Ugartemendia, I. Landa del Barrio, M. Quartulli, H. Camblong</p>
            <p>In the last few years, energy efficiency has become a challenge. Not only mitigating environmental impact but reducing energy waste can lead to financial advantages. Buildings play an important role in this: they are among the biggest consumers. So, finding manners to reduce energy consumption is a way to minimise energy waste, and a technique for that is creating Demand Response (DR) strategies. This paper proposes a novel way to decrease computational effort of simulating the behaviour of a building using surrogate models based on active learning. Before going straight to the problem of a building, which is complex and computationally costly, the paper proposes the approach of active learning to a smaller problem: with reduced simulations, regress the curve of voltage versus current of a thermo-resistor. Then, the paper implements a surrogate model of energy consumption of a building. The goal is to be able to learn the consumption pattern based on a limited number of simulations. The result given by the surrogate can be used to set the reference temperature, maximising the PV self-consumption, and reducing energy usage from the grid. Thanks to the surrogate, the total time spent to map all possible consumption scenarios is reduced around 7 times.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Analysis Approach for Oscillation Damping in Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Heterogeneous Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhu, Xiuqiang He, Hongyang Qing, Hua Geng</p>
            <p>This letter proposes a decentralized local gain condition (LGC) to guarantee oscillation damping in inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated power systems. The LGC constrains the dynamic gain between each IBR and the network at its point of connection. By satisfying the LGC locally, the closed-loop poles are confined to a desired region, thereby yielding system-wide oscillation damping without requiring global information. Notably, the LGC is agnostic to different IBR dynamics, well-suited for systems with heterogeneous IBRs, and flexible to various damping requirements. Moreover, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to parameterize LGC, providing scalable and damping-constrained parameter tuning guidance for IBRs.</p>

            <h2>A Thermal-Electrical Co-Optimization Framework for Active Distribution Grids with Electric Vehicles and Heat Pumps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savvas Panagi, Chrysovalantis Spanias, Petros Aristidou</p>
            <p>The growing electrification of transportation and heating through Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Heat Pumps (HPs) introduces both flexibility and complexity to Active Distribution Networks (ADNs). These resources provide substantial operational flexibility but also create tightly coupled thermal-electrical dynamics that challenge conventional network management. This paper proposes a unified co-optimization framework that integrates a calibrated 3R2C grey-box building thermal model into a network-constrained Optimal Power Flow (OPF). The framework jointly optimizes EVs, HPs, and photovoltaic systems while explicitly enforcing thermal comfort, Distributed Energy Resource (DER) limits, and full power flow physics. To maintain computational tractability, Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) relaxations are evaluated on a realistic low-voltage feeder. The analysis shows that, despite network heterogeneity violating some theoretical exactness conditions, the relaxation remains exact in practice. Comparative assessments of convex DistFlow, bus injection, and branch flow formulations reveal that convex DistFlow achieves sub-second runtimes and near-optimal performance even at high DER penetration levels. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of coordinated scheduling, yielding reductions of 41% in transformer aging, 54% in losses, and complete elimination of voltage violations, demonstrating the value of integrated thermal-electrical coordination in future smart grids.</p>

            <h2>A Gradient-Based Capacity Accreditation Framework in Resource Adequacy: Formulation, Computation, and Practical Implications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zhang, Feng Zhao, Gord Stephen, Chanan Singh, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Probabilistic resource adequacy assessment is a cornerstone of modern capacity accreditation. This paper develops a gradient-based framework, in which capacity accreditation is interpreted as the directional derivative of a probabilistic resource adequacy metric with respect to resource capacity, that unifies two widely used accreditation approaches: Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) and Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI). Under mild regularity conditions, we show that marginal ELCC and MRI yield equivalent accreditation factors, while their numerical implementations exhibit markedly different computational characteristics. Building on this framework, we demonstrate how infinitesimal perturbation analysis enables up to a $1000\times$ speedup in gradient estimation for capacity accreditation, and we implement gradient-informed search algorithms that significantly accelerate ELCC computations relative to standard bisection methods. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments show that MRI achieves substantial runtime reductions compared to ELCC and exhibits greater robustness to perturbation step-size selection. These results provide practical guidance for implementing efficient and scalable capacity accreditation in large-scale power systems.</p>

            <h2>Reformulating Energy Storage Capacity Accreditation Problem with Marginal Reliability Impact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zhang, Feng Zhao, Tongxin Zheng, Le Xie</p>
            <p>To enhance the efficiency of capacity markets, many electricity markets in the U.S. are adopting or planning to implement marginal capacity accreditation reforms. This paper provides new insights into energy storage capacity accreditation using Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI). We reformulate the commonly used reliability-based storage dispatch model as an optimization problem, enabling direct calculation of the MRI from the Lagrange multipliers, rather than using brute-force perturbation analysis. The analysis demonstrates that the EUE is a piecewise linear function and the storage MRI retains a non-negative property across various system scenarios. We further explore the influence of qualified capacity (QC), storage dispatch rules, and other key factors on storage accreditation, providing practical insights for system operators. Additionally, comparisons of storage capacity accreditation under different reliability criteria offer valuable guidance for policymakers in setting future standards. Numerical results from a modified California system validate our findings and highlight several important phenomena associated with the MRI-based accreditation scheme.</p>

            <p>Voltage (Volt) and reactive-power (VAR) control in transmission networks is critical for reliability and increasingly needs fast, implementable decisions. This paper presents a transmission Volt/VAR Optimization (VVO) framework that co-optimizes discrete control of on-load tap-changing transformers (OLTCs) and capacitor banks (CBs) with AC power flow (ACPF) physics to improve voltage stability and minimize VAR generation. The framework follows a relax-round-resolve pipeline: a continuous relaxation proposes targets, a rounding step selects feasible discrete settings, and a final solve enforces AC power flow physics. Extensive experiments on IEEE, PEGASE, and RTE systems show consistent improvements in voltage and VAR quality metrics with modest generator redispatch while preserving economic operation and achieving compatible runtimes with real-time transmission operations.</p>

            <h2>Multi-threshold time series analysis enables characterization of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Kittel, Wolf-Peter Schill</p>
            <p>Variable renewable energy droughts, so called Dunkelflaute events, emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Kehao Zhuang, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Gabriela Hug, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Jiang, Weili Xu, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>The urgent need for building decarbonization calls for a paradigm shift in future autonomous building energy operation, from human-intensive engineering workflows toward intelligent agents that interact with physics-grounded digital environments. This study proposes an end-to-end agentic AI-enabled Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) environment for scalable building energy modeling, simulation, control, and automation. The framework consists of (1) a modular and physics-consistent PIML digital environment spanning building thermal dynamics, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and distributed energy resources (DER) for grid-interactive energy management; and (2) an agentic AI layer with 11 specialist agents and 72 Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that enable end-to-end execution of multi-step energy analytics. A representative case study demonstrates multi-domain, multi-agent coordination for assessing how system and control upgrades affect energy use, operating cost, thermal comfort, and flexibility. In addition, a large-scale benchmark (about 4000 runs) systematically evaluates workflow performance in terms of accuracy, token consumption, execution time, and inference cost. The results quantify the impacts of intelligence mode design, model size, task complexity, and orchestrator-specialist coordination, and provide key lessons for building future agentic AI systems in real-world building energy applications. This work establishes a scalable, physics-grounded foundation for deploying agentic AI in decarbonized and grid-interactive building operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaoze Mu, Yanzhao Hou, Mingjie Chen, Yuanyu Hu, Yongan Zheng, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao</p>
            <p>This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating the coverage performance of the fluid antenna system (FAS)-enhanced LoRa wide-area networks (LoRaWANs). We investigate the effects of large-scale pathloss in LoRaWAN, small-scale fading characterized by FAS, and dense interference (i.e., collision in an ALOHA-based mechanism) arising from randomly deployed end devices (EDs). Both co-spreading factor (co-SF) interference (with the same SF) and inter-SF interference (with different SFs) are introduced into the network, and their differences in physical characteristics are also considered in the analysis. Additionally, simple yet accurate statistical approximations of the FAS channel envelope and power are derived using the extreme-value theorem. Based on the approximated channel expression, the theoretical coverage probability of the proposed FAS-enhanced LoRaWAN is derived. Numerical results validate our analytical approximations by exhibiting close agreement with the exact correlation model. Notably, it is revealed that a FAS with a normalized aperture of 1 times 1 can greatly enhance network performance, in terms of both ED numbers and coverage range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhua Zhao, Tiejun Lv, Ke Wang</p>
            <p>Satellite-based Internet of Things (S-IoT) faces a fundamental trilemma: propagation delay, dynamic fading, and bandwidth scarcity. While Layer-coded Hybrid ARQ (L-HARQ) enhances reliability, its backtracking decoding introduces age ambiguity, undermining the standard Age of Information (AoI) metric and obscuring the critical trade-off between data freshness and transmission efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel cross-layer optimization framework centered on a new metric, the Cross-layer Age of Error Information (C-AoEI). We derive a closed-form expression for C-AoEI, explicitly linking freshness to system parameters, establishing an explicit analytical connection between freshness degradation and channel dynamics. Building on this, we develop a packet-level encoded L-HARQ scheme for multi-GBS scenarios and an adaptive algorithm that jointly optimizes coding and decision thresholds. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework: it achieves 31.8% higher transmission efficiency and 17.2% lower C-AoEI than conventional schemes. The framework also proves robust against inter-cell interference and varying channel conditions, providing a foundation for designing efficient, latency-aware next-generation S-IoT protocols.</p>

To solve the sum rate maximization problem, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based reinforcement learning (HGRL) algorithm. Simulation results prove that 3D deployment of pinching antenna array outperforms 1D and 2D counterparts in ISAC systems. Moreover, the proposed HGRL algorithm surpasses other baselines in both performance and convergence speed due to the advanced observation construction of the environment.</p>

            <p>In this paper, a general ISAC system where the base station (BS) communicates with multiple users and performs target detection is considered. Then, a sum communication rate maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the constraints of transmit power and the minimum sensing rates of users. To solve this problem, we develop a framework that leverages deep learning algorithms to provide a three-stage solution for ISAC beamforming. The three-stage beamforming optimization solution includes three modules: 1) an unsupervised learning based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to extract fixed-size latent features while keeping its essential information from the variable channel state information (CSI); 2) a reinforcement learning (RL) based beampattern optimization algorithm is proposed to search the desired beampattern according to the extracted features; 3) a supervised learning based beamforming reconstruction algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the beamforming vector from beampattern given by the RL agent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed three-stage solution outperforms the baseline RL algorithm by optimizing the intuitional beampattern rather than beamforming.</p>

The QRL agent can explore the exponentially large scheduling space effectively by applying Grover's search to the reinforcement learning process. The model is implemented using our designed quantum-gate-based circuit, which imitates the layered architecture of reinforcement learning, where quantum operations act as policy updates and decision-making units.

First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes, for the first time, a hybrid multiple access framework that integrates the principles of rate-splitting (RS) and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) in an SISO downlink scenario. The proposed scheme, termed RS-SCMA, unifies the powerful interference management capability of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with the near-optimal multiuser detection of SCMA. A key feature of RS-SCMA is a tunable splitting factor $\alpha$, which governs the allocation between the generic $M$-ary modulated common messages and SCMA-encoded private messages. This enables dynamic control over the fundamental trade-off between system sum-rate, bit error rate (BER), and the overloading factor. We develop novel transmitter and receiver architectures based on soft successive interference cancellation (SIC), incorporating message passing algorithm (MPA) detection and soft-symbol reconstruction. Furthermore, a unified analytical expression for the achievable sum-rate is derived as a function of the splitting factor $\alpha$. The performance of the proposed RS-SCMA system is evaluated in terms of both BER and sum-rate. Simulation results confirm the superiority of RS-SCMA over conventional SCMA and multi-carrier RSMA, demonstrating its scalability and robustness even in the presence of channel estimation errors.</p>

            <p>We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals. To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization. Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.</p>

            <p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</p>

            <p>This work presents (i) a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a power system with line dynamics and heterogeneous bus dynamics, (ii) a novel reduced-order model of damper windings in synchronous machines, and (iii) a proportional-derivative (PD) damper winding emulation control for voltage-source converters (VSCs). Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation.</p>

            <h2>Dual Analysis of Continuous-time Economic Dispatch and Its Price Implications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Menghan Zhang, Caisheng Wang</p>
            <p>As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.</p>

Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice. Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) addresses this limitation by replacing explicit models with data. We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.</p>

The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Chaojie Li, Xin Li, Yingyi Yan, Mingyang Zheng</p>
            <p>This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</p>

            <h2>Data-Efficient Physics-Informed Learning to Model Synchro-Waveform Dynamics of Grid-Integrated Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivanshu Tripathi, Hossein Mohsenzadeh Yazdi, Maziar Raissi, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad</p>
            <p>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.</p>

            <p>This paper studies the problem of maximizing revenue from a grid-scale battery energy storage system, accounting for uncertain future electricity prices and the effect of degradation on battery lifetime. We formulate this task as an online resource allocation problem. We propose an algorithm, based on online mirror descent, that is no-regret in the stochastic i.i.d. setting and attains finite asymptotic competitive ratio in the adversarial setting (robustness). When untrusted advice about the opportunity cost of degradation is available, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm that performs well when the advice is accurate (consistency) while still retaining robustness properties when the advice is poor.</p>

            <p>This research study analyses different types of photovoltaic (PV) energy sharing in a collective self-consumption (CSC) real-case in the Izarbel technological park in France. The analysis is carried out above all from the point of view of the self-consumption rate (SCR) and the savings. After explaining the emergence of the self-consumption concept for the integration of renewable energies, the study case is described. The PV energy is produced in ESTIA1 building and consumed in ESTIA1, 2 and 4 buildings. The main IoT components used to implement the CSC are smart meters and the Tecsol TICs; devices based on the LoRa protocol to retrieve production and consumption data. Then, the characteristics of PV energy sharing in France are explained, in particular the three possible types of energy sharing/allocation (static, dynamic by default and customised dynamic) and the structure of the electricity bill. Finally, the three types of sharing are compared in four scenarios (without and with a data centre, for low and high solar radiation). The results show that the dynamic allocations lead to increases of the SCR and that the customised dynamic sharing increases savings.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven nonparametric Li-ion battery ageing model aiming at learning from real operation data -- Part A: Storage operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucu M., Martinez-Laserna E., Gandiaga I., Liu K., Camblong H., Widanage W.D., Marco J</p>
            <p>Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing. In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model. This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.</p>

            <h2>A Cherry-Picking Approach to Large Load Shaping for More Effective Carbon Reduction</h2>

            <p>Shaping multi-megawatt loads, such as data centers, impacts generator dispatch on the electric grid, which in turn affects system CO2 emissions and energy cost. Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that "cherry-picks" a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data. The cherry-picking approach to power load shaping is applicable to any large flexible consumer on the electricity grid, such as data centers, distributed energy resources and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).</p>

            <h2>Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Aditya Rangarajan, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper analyzes a method to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing by introducing consumer-based carbon costs and a carbon allocation mechanism. Specifically, consumers submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. The carbon allocation mechanism then assigns emissions from generation to consumers to minimize overall carbon costs. Our analysis starts from a previously proposed centralized market clearing formulation that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility, and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation that incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and demand reductions.</p>

            <p>Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.</p>

            <p>Modern buildings are increasingly interconnected with occupancy, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, distributed energy resources (DERs), and power grids. Modeling, control, and optimization of such multi-domain systems play a critical role in achieving building-sector decarbonization. However, most existing tools lack scalability and physical consistency for addressing these complex, multi-scale ecosystem problems. To bridge this gap, this study presents BESTOpt, a modular, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework that unifies building applications, including benchmarking, evaluation, diagnostics, control, optimization, and performance simulation. The framework adopts a cluster-domain-system/building-component hierarchy and a standardized state-action-disturbance-observation data typology. By embedding physics priors into data-driven modules, BESTOpt improves model accuracy and physical consistency under unseen conditions. Case studies on single-building and cluster scenarios demonstrate its capability for multi-level centralized and decentralized control. Looking ahead, BESTOpt lays the foundation for an open, extensible platform that accelerates interdisciplinary research toward smart, resilient, and decarbonized building ecosystems.</p>

            <p>Data centers are growing rapidly, creating the pressing need for the development of critical infrastructure build out to support these resource-intensive large loads. Their immense consumption of electricity and, often, freshwater, continues to stress an already constrained and aging power grid and water resources. This paper presents a comprehensive modeling approach to determine the optimal locations to construct such facilities by quantifying their resource use and minimizing associated costs. The interdisciplinary modeling approach incorporates a number of factors including the power grid, telecommunications, climate, water use, and collocated generation potential. This work establishes the base model whose functionality is shown through several test cases focusing on carbon-free generation collocation on a county-level in the United States. The results suggest that while capital costs are the biggest driver, having a longer future outlook and allowing more variable generation collocation influences the model to choose sites with higher renewable potential.</p>

The control parameters are designed for decoupling and pole placement. The proposed method exhibits strong robustness in stability and dynamical performance across varying and uncertain grid strengths. The robust control performance of the proposed method is first demonstrated by small-signal analysis, then validated by experiments on a 20 kVA power conversion system.</p>

For the purposes of this study, a test signal was adopted recreating the states of the power grid, including the simultaneous occurrence of voltage fluctuations and distortions.

            <p>The most common instruments currently measuring active/reactive energy and power quality indicators are smart energy meters.

This paper presents challenges in the proper metrological verification of smart energy meters. It presents existing legal and normative requirements and scientific research directions regarding these meters. Selected test results are presented, which show that although the tested meters meet the normative and legal requirements because they have been approved for sale, numerous imperfections in the signal and measurement chains of the analyzed instruments are revealed for the selected test signal. On the basis of the presented research results, further directions of research in the field of smart energy meters have been determined.</p>

            <p>The ongoing global transition towards low-carbon energy has propelled the integration of offshore wind farms, which, when combined with Modular Multilevel Converter-based High-Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) transmission, present unique challenges for power system protection. In collector cables connecting wind turbines to offshore MMC, both ends are supplied by Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), which modify the magnitude and characteristics of fault currents. In this context, this paper investigates the limitations of conventional differential protection schemes under such conditions and compares them with enhanced strategies that account for sequence components. Using electromagnetic transient simulations of a representative offshore wind farm modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software, internal and external fault scenarios are assessed, varying fault types and resistances. The comparative evaluation provides insights into the sensitivity and selectivity of differential protection and guides a deeper conceptual understanding of the evolving protection challenges inherent to future converter-dominated grids.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ou, Bin Wang, Slava Maslennikov, Hanchao Liu, Jim Follum</p>
            <p>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) convert high-speed waveform data into low-speed phasor data, which are fundamental to wide-area monitoring and control in power systems, with oscillation detection and localization among their most prominent applications. However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Zhengmao Li, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>In low-carbon grids, system flexibility can be enhanced through mechanisms such as Demand Response (DR), enabling the efficient utilization of renewable energy. However, as Synchronous Generators (SGs) are being replaced by renewable energy sources characterized by Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), system stability is severely affected. Due to the limited overload capability of IBRs, their Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of SGs. As a result, protection devices may fail to trip during faults. Consequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in providing sufficient SCC. Since the commitment of SGs is closely related to system loading conditions, DR can indirectly affect their SCC provision, a relationship that has not yet been investigated in the literature. Therefore, this paper incorporates both DR and SCC constraints into a unit commitment problem and conducts case studies on an IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that although DR can reduce total costs by adjusting power demand, it may also lead to inadequate SCC levels. Nevertheless, when flexible loads are properly coordinated with SCC requirements, the total cost increases by only 0.3%, which is significantly lower than the cost of system dispatch without DR. This demonstrates that DR can facilitate stable system operation in a cost-effective manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian, Javad Lavaei</p>
            <p>This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF.

            <p>Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>A Two-Stage Risk-Averse DRO-MILP Methodological Framework for Managing AI/Data Center Demand Shocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sharaf K. Magableh, Caisheng Wang, Oraib Dawaghreh</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers is reshaping electricity demand patterns. This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads. This contributes a scalable planning tool for resilient, AI-integrated distribution grids.</p>

            <h2>Efficient reformulations of ReLU deep neural networks for surrogate modelling in power system optimisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar, S. Ali Pourmousavi, Jon A.R. Liisberg, Julian Lesmos-Vinasco</p>
            <p>The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.</p>

            <h2>Ramping-aware Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation of Distributed Generation with Energy Storage in Power Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongon Park, Daniel K. Molzahn, Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks are increasingly hosting controllable and flexible distributed energy resources (DERs) that, when aggregated, can provide ancillary support to transmission systems. However, existing aggregation schemes often ignore the ramping constraints of these DERs, which can render them impractical in real deployments. This work proposes a ramping-aware flexibility aggregation scheme, computed at the transmission-distribution boundary, that explicitly accounts for DER ramp limits and yields flexibility envelopes that are provably disaggregable. To further enhance the attainable flexibility region, we introduce a novel pre-ramping strategy, which proactively adjusts resource operating points to enlarge the aggregated flexibility envelope while preserving both network feasibility and disaggregation guarantees. The proposed method demonstrates a 5.2% to 19.2% improvement in flexibility relative to the baseline model, depending on system conditions. We validate the scheme on an IEEE-33 bus distribution system and provide formal proofs showing that both aggregation strategies are disaggregable for all feasible trajectories within the aggregate flexibility envelope.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil & gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khaled Bin Walid, Feng Ye, Jiaxiang Ji, Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, Travis Miles, Yazhou Leo Jiang</p>
            <p>This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunki Hong, Jisoo Lee</p>
            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics can mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce an operator-legible evaluation framework -- Under-Prediction Rate (UPR), tail Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$ requirements, and explicit inflation diagnostics (Bias$_{24h}$/OPR) -- to quantify one-sided reliability risk beyond MAPE. Using this framework, we evaluate state space models (Mamba variants) and strong baselines on a weather-aligned California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 regional transmission areas) under a rolling-origin walk-forward backtest. We develop and evaluate thermal-lag-aligned weather fusion strategies for these architectures. Our results demonstrate that standard accuracy metrics are insufficient proxies for operational safety: models with comparable MAPE can imply materially different tail reserve requirements (Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$). We show that explicit weather integration narrows error distributions, reducing the impact of temperature-driven demand spikes. Furthermore, while probabilistic calibration reduces large-error events, it can induce systematic schedule inflation. We introduce Bias/OPR-constrained objectives to enable auditable trade-offs between minimizing tail risk and preventing trivial over-forecasting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun-Yan Jiang, Wei-Yu Chiu, Yuan-Po Tsai</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly integrated into power grids, offering economic and environmental benefits but introducing challenges due to uncoordinated charging. This study addresses the profit maximization problem for multiple EV charging stations (EVCSs) equipped with energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy sources (RES), with the capability for energy trading. We propose a Double Hypernetwork QMIX-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize cooperative energy management under uncertainty in EV demand, renewable generation, and real-time electricity prices. The framework mitigates overestimation bias in value estimation, enables distributed decision-making, and incorporates an internal energy trading mechanism. Numerical experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to standard QMIX, the proposed method achieves approximately 5.3% and 12.7% higher total profit for the two regions, respectively, highlighting its economic and operational efficiency. Additionally, the approach maintains robust performance under varying levels of EV demand uncertainty and renewable energy fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Reachability Guarantees for Energy Arbitrage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomás Tapia, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a unified framework for battery energy arbitrage under uncertain market prices that integrates chance-constrained terminal state-of-charge requirements with online threshold policies. We first cast the multi-interval arbitrage problem as a stochastic dynamic program enhanced by a probabilistic end-of-horizon state-of-charge (SoC) constraint, ensuring with high confidence that the battery terminates within a prescribed energy band. We then apply a $k$-search algorithm to derive explicit charging (buying) and discharging (selling) thresholds with provable worst-case competitive ratio, and compute the corresponding action probabilities over the decision horizon. To compute exact distributions under operational limits, we develop a probability redistribution pruning method and use it to quantify the likelihood of meeting the terminal SoC band. Leveraging the resulting SoC distribution, we estimate the minimum stopping-time required to satisfy the SoC chance constraint. Computational experiments on historical real price data demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves the estimation of SoC evolution and supports chance-constraint satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing the Impact of EV Battery Charging on the Distribution Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Aziz, Wajid Ali, Khaliqur Rahman</p>
            <p>Many countries are rapidly adopting electric vehicles (EVs) due to their meager running cost and environment-friendly nature. EVs are likely to dominate the internal combustion (IC) engine cars entirely over the next few years. With the rise in popularity of EVs, adverse effects of EV charging loads on the grid system have been observed. Since the distribution system (DS) does not cope with the high overloading capacity, the negative impact of EV charging load on the distribution network (DN) cannot be neglected. A high level of EV penetration with uncoordinated charging is the primary cause of voltage instability, increased peak load demand, and reliability issues of the DN. In this paper, a detailed overview of all the notable impacts of EV charging on voltage profile, power quality, and DS performance is discussed. This work also reviews the different topologies of EV chargers and the issues introduced by power converters on the utility grid. Finally, the strategies for improving the charging of EVs proposed in the literature to consider the random nature of EVs charging, the management of peak loads, and bidirectional power flow are summarized.</p>

            <h2>Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Enhancing Resilience of Microgrids under Extreme Weather Events</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Wu, Wei-Yu Chiu, Yuan-Po Tsai, Shangyuan Liu, Weiqi Hua</p>
            <p>Grid resilience is crucial in light of power interruptions caused by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Well-designed energy management systems (EMS) have made progress in improving microgrid resilience through the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs), but still face significant challenges in addressing the uncertainty of load demand caused by extreme weather. The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit with a gating mechanism was introduced to extract features from temporal data, which enables the EMS to coordinate DERs more efficiently. Next, the proposed MADRL method incorporating action masking techniques was evaluated in the IEEE 33-Bus system using real-world data on renewable generation and power load. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in reducing operating costs as well as the effectiveness in enhancing microgrid resilience during power interruptions.</p>

            <p>The increasing global push for carbon reduction highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy into the supply chain of cellular networks. However, due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and the uneven load distribution across base stations, the utilization rate of renewable energy remains low. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the trade-off between carbon emissions and downlink throughput in cellular networks, offering insights into optimizing both network performance and sustainability. The renewable energy state of base station batteries and the number of occupied channels are modeled as a quasi-birth-death process. We construct models for the probability of channel blocking, average successful transmission probability for users, downlink throughput, carbon emissions, and carbon efficiency based on stochastic geometry. Based on these analyses, an energy-based cell association scheme is proposed to optimize the carbon efficiency of cellular networks. The results show that, compared to the closest cell association scheme, the energy-based cell association scheme is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the network by 13.0% and improving the carbon efficiency by 11.3%.</p>

            <h2>Convex Model Predictive Control for Safe Output Consensus of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Wang, Shuyuan Zhang, Lei Wang</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamics and safety constraints typically result in a nonlinear programming problem when applying model predictive control to achieve safe output consensus. To avoid the heavy computational burden of solving a nonlinear programming problem directly, this paper proposes a novel Convex Model Predictive Control (CMPC) approach based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) scheme. The core of our method lies in transforming the nonlinear constraints into linear forms: we linearize the system dynamics and convexify the discrete-time high-order control barrier functions using a proposed tangent-line projection method. Consequently, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic program that can be iteratively solved within the SQP scheme at each time step of CMPC. Furthermore, we provide the formal guarantee of the convergence of the SQP scheme, and subsequently guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of CMPC. Simulations on multi-agent systems with unicycle dynamics demonstrate a 35-52 times reduction in computation time compared with baseline methods, confirming the suitability of the proposed approach for real-time safe output consensus control.</p>

            <p>Power system outages expose market participants to significant financial risk unless promptly detected and hedged. We develop an outage identification method from public market signals grounded in the parametric quickest change detection (QCD) theory. Parametric QCD operates on stochastic data streams, distinguishing pre- and post-change regimes using the ratio of their respective probability density functions. To derive the density functions for normal and post-outage market signals, we exploit multi-parametric programming to decompose complex market signals into parametric random variables with a known density. These densities are then used to construct a QCD-based statistic that triggers an alarm as soon as the statistic exceeds an appropriate threshold. Numerical experiments on a stylized PJM testbed demonstrate rapid line outage identification from public streams of electricity demand and price data.</p>

            <p>We study the problem of non-parametric clustering of data sequences, where each data sequence comprises independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples generated from an unknown distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum number of samples from the data sequences, given a specified error probability. To solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both SEQ-SPEC and IA-SEQ-SPEC perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential $K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED), and the Sequential Single Linkage clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). In addition, we propose memory-efficient versions, SEQ-SPEC-B and IA-SEQ-SPEC-B. Unlike other related sequential clustering algorithms, which require storing all past samples, these algorithms require storing only the most recent $B$ samples. Both the computationally efficient and memory-efficient versions of SEQ-SPEC perform comparably to SEQ-SPEC in simulations.</p>

            <p>Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor, average emission factor, and day-ahead market prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and Scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.</p>

            <h2>Distribution Steering for Discrete-Time Uncertain Ensemble Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyu Wu, Panagiotis Tsiotras, Anders Lindquist</p>
            <p>Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., ``steering'') the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Linear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide a numerical example to validate our theoretical developments.</p>

            <h2>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Osinenko</p>
            <p>This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</p>

            <h2>$k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Adib Oumer, Vishnu Murali, Majid Zamani</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce two new types of barrier certificates that are based on multiple functions rather than a single one. A conventional barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system is a nonnegative real-valued function whose expected value does not increase as the system evolves. This requirement guarantees that the barrier certificate forms a nonnegative supermartingale and can be used to derive a lower bound on the probability that the system remains safe. A key advantage of such certificates is that they can be automatically searched for using tools such as optimization programs instantiated with a fixed template. When this search is unsuccessful, the common practice is to modify the template and attempt the synthesis again. Drawing inspiration from logical interpolation, we first propose an alternative framework that uses a collection of functions to jointly serve as a barrier certificate. We refer to this construct as an interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. Nonetheless, we observe that these certificates still require one function in the collection to satisfy a supermartingale condition. Motivated by recent work in the literature, we next combine k-induction with interpolation-inspired certificates to relax this supermartingale constraint. We develop a general and more flexible notion of barrier certificates, which we call k-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. This formulation encompasses multiple ways of integrating interpolation-inspired barrier certificates with k-induction. We highlight two specific instantiations among these possible combinations. For polynomial systems, we employ sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to synthesize the corresponding set of functions. Finally, through our case studies, we show that the proposed methods enable the use of simpler templates and yield tighter lower bounds on the safety probability.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested "in the wild". Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources.

Its core, Kids-Weighted Finite State Transducer (K-WFST), merges an acoustic phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity model to capture child-specific speech errors while remaining fully interpretable. K-WFST achieves a 1.39 % phoneme error rate on MyST and 8.61 % on Multitudes-an absolute improvement of 10.47 % and 7.06 % over a greedy-search decoder. These high-quality transcripts are used by an LLM to grade verbal skills, developmental milestones, reading, and comprehension, with results that align closely with human evaluators. Our findings show that precise phoneme recognition is essential for creating an effective assessment framework, enabling scalable language screening for children.</p>

            <h2>Shared representations in brains and models reveal a two-route cortical organization during scene perception</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Marcos-Manchón, Lluís Fuentemilla</p>
            <p>The brain transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional cortical representations that support diverse cognitive and behavioral goals. Characterizing how this information is organized and routed across the human brain is essential for understanding how we process complex visual scenes. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis to 7T fMRI data collected during natural scene viewing. We quantified representational geometry shared across individuals and compared it to hierarchical features from vision and language neural networks. This analysis revealed two distinct processing routes: a ventromedial pathway specialized for scene layout and environmental context, and a lateral occipitotemporal pathway selective for animate content. Vision models aligned with shared structure in both routes, whereas language models corresponded primarily with the lateral pathway. These findings refine classical visual-stream models by characterizing scene perception as a distributed cortical network with separable representational routes for context and animate content.</p>

            <h2>TurnGuide: Enhancing Meaningful Full Duplex Spoken Interactions via Dynamic Turn-Level Text-Speech Interleaving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Cui, Lei Zhu, Xiaohui Li, Zhihan Guo, Haoli Bai, Lu Hou, Irwin King</p>
            <p>Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling complex conversational turn-taking such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue patterns for human-like interactions, but their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. Although interleaved text-speech generation could mitigate this degradation, integrating discrete text tokens into continuous double-channel audio streams could disrupt the precise time alignment required for fluid interaction. To address this, we propose TurnGuide, a novel text-speech interleaved generation approach for e2e FD-SLMs that dynamically segments assistant speech into dialogue turns and interleaves turn-level text and speech generation. This approach allows FD-SLMs to integrate the semantic intelligence of LLMs without compromising the natural acoustic flow. Extensive experiments show that TurnGuide not only significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs to produce semantically meaningful, coherent speech but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on various turn-taking events.

            <h2>Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanlin Zhang, Sungyong Chung, Nachuan Li, Dana Monzer, Hani S. Mahmassani, Samer H. Hamdar, Alireza Talebpour</p>
            <p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p>

            <p>Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear. We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust SingFake detection systems.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Jamming based on Beam-Steering Antennas and Intelligent UAV Swarm Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Silva, António Grilo</p>
            <p>In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue. This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further research.</p>

            <p>Creativity is a core cognitive capacity underlying innovation and adaptive problem solving, yet how it is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is not fully understood. While resting-state fMRI studies have identified large-scale network correlates associated with differences in creativity, EEG provides the temporal resolution for examining oscillatory dynamics contributing to intrinsic network organization. We examined whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with individual differences across multiple creativity-related measures. Thirty healthy young adults completed a multidimensional creativity battery comprising the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), the Divergent Association Task (DAT), the Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and a Self-rating (SR) of creative ability. Graph-theoretical analyses of alpha-band functional connectivity revealed two participant groups, each with distinct patterns of neural activity: Cluster 1 showed reduced global connectivity with relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity; Cluster 0 exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. Notably, Cluster 1 reported higher self-rated creative ability and more frequent engagement in real-world creative activities. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with variation in creative self-efficacy and creative engagement, highlighting characteristic patterns of alpha-band network organization observed at rest.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at this https URL .</p>

            <h2>Covering in Hamming and Grassmann Spaces: New Bounds and Reed--Solomon-Based Constructions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samin Riasat, Hessam Mahdavifar</p>
            <p>We study covering problems in Hamming and Grassmann spaces through a unified coding-theoretic and information-theoretic framework. Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks. On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.</p>

It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components. The model also reflects the prerequisite relationships between construction activities and calculates the delay penalty resulting from parts delivery lead time. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cel Thys, Rodney Martinez Alonso, Sofie Pollin</p>
            <p>This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</p>

            <h2>Zonotope Shadow and Reflection Matching: A Novel GNSS Reflection-Based Framework for Enhanced Positioning Accuracy in Urban Areas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghyun Kim, Jiwon Seo</p>
            <p>In urban areas, signal reception conditions are often poor due to reflections from buildings, resulting in inaccurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning. Various 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques, including shadow matching, have been proposed to address this issue. However, conventional shadow matching estimates positions in a discretized manner. The accuracy of this approach is limited by the resolution of the grid points representing the candidate receiver positions, making it difficult to achieve robust urban positioning and to ensure that the position estimate satisfies user-specified protection levels or safety bounds. To overcome these limitations, zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) has been proposed, which utilizes a set-based position estimate rather than grid-based estimates. ZSM calculates the GNSS shadow--an area on the ground where the line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked and only non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals can be received--to estimate the receiver's position set. ZSM distinguishes between LOS and NLOS satellites, determining that the receiver is inside the GNSS shadow if the satellite is NLOS and outside if the satellite is LOS. However, relying solely on GNSS shadows limits the ability to sufficiently reduce the size of the receiver position set and to precisely estimate the receiver's location. To address this, we propose zonotope shadow and reflection matching (ZSRM) to enhance positioning accuracy in urban areas. The proposed ZSRM technique is validated through field tests using GNSS signals collected in an urban environment. Consequently, the RMS horizontal position error of ZSRM improved by 10.0% to 53.6% compared with ZSM, while the RMS cross-street and along-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1% and 30.7% to 59.3%, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon D'Agostino, Jimmy Chen, Ram Rajagopal</p>
            <p>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) depends heavily on the reliability of charging infrastructure, yet approximately 1 in 5 drivers report being unable to charge during station visits due to inoperable equipment. While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent "zombie chargers" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Salamatmoghadasi, Amir Mehrabian, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Georges Kaddoum</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of radio access networks (RANs) is increasing energy consumption and challenging the sustainability of future systems. We consider a dense-urban vertical heterogeneous network (vHetNet) comprising a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as a super macro base station, a terrestrial macro base station (MBS), and multiple small base stations (SBSs). We propose a HAPS-enhanced cell-switching algorithm that selectively deactivates SBSs based on their traffic load and the capacity and channel conditions of both the MBS and HAPS. The resulting energy-minimization problem, subject to an outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and reformulated into a mixed-integer program for efficient solution. Using realistic 3GPP channel models, simulations show substantial energy savings versus All-ON, terrestrial cell switching, and sorting benchmarks. Relative to All-ON, the proposed method reduces power consumption by up to 77% at low loads and about 40% at high loads; a NoQoS variant achieves up to 90% and 47%, respectively. The approach maintains high served-traffic levels and provides a tunable trade-off between power efficiency and outage-based QoS, supporting scalable and sustainable 6G deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Baughman, Marena Trujillo, Bri-Mathias Hodge, Emily Jensen</p>
            <p>The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

The resulting energy-minimization problem, subject to an outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and reformulated into a mixed-integer program for efficient solution. Using realistic 3GPP channel models, simulations show substantial energy savings versus All-ON, terrestrial cell switching, and sorting benchmarks. Relative to All-ON, the proposed method reduces power consumption by up to 77% at low loads and about 40% at high loads; a NoQoS variant achieves up to 90% and 47%, respectively. The approach maintains high served-traffic levels and provides a tunable trade-off between power efficiency and outage-based QoS, supporting scalable and sustainable 6G deployments.</p>

            <h2>Determining optimal thermal energy storage charging temperature for cooling using integrated building and coil modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ju-Hong Oh, Seon-In Kim, Eui-Jong Kim</p>
            <p>Thermal energy storage (TES) systems coupled with heat pumps offer significant potential for improving building energy efficiency by shifting electricity demand to off-peak hours. However, conventional operating strategies maintain conservatively low chilled water temperatures throughout the cooling season, a practice that results in suboptimal heat pump performance. This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 °C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance. This study contributes a practical methodology for optimizing TES charging temperatures in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems while maintaining indoor setpoint temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Resource Allocation Scheme for Bistatic ISAC with Data Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Henninger, Lucas Giroto, Ahmed Elkelesh, Silvio Mandelli</p>
            <p>Bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables efficient reuse of the existing cellular infrastructure and is likely to play an important role in future sensing networks. In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link. Simulation results validate our approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect the sensing performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Baughman, Marena Trujillo, Bri-Mathias Hodge, Emily Jensen</p>
            <p>The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akhilesh Raj, Swann Perarnau, Aniruddha Gokhale, Solomon Bekele Abera</p>
            <p>Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system. In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training. Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Faezeh Ardali, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>Natural hazards such as hurricanes and floods damage power grid equipment, forcing operators to replan restoration repeatedly as new information becomes available. This paper develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) dispatcher that serves as a real-time decision engine for crew-to-repair assignments. We model restoration as a sequential, information-revealing process and learn an actor-critic policy over compact features such as component status, travel/repair times, crew availability, and marginal restoration value. A feasibility mask blocks unsafe or inoperable actions, such as power flow limits, switching rules, and crew-time constraints, before they are applied. To provide realistic runtime inputs without relying on heavy solvers, we use lightweight surrogates for wind and flood intensities, fragility-based failure, spatial clustering of damage, access impairments, and progressive ticket arrivals. In simulated hurricane and flood events, the learned policy updates crew decisions in real time as new field reports arrive. Because the runtime logic is lightweight, it improves online performance (energy-not-supplied, critical-load restoration time, and travel distance) compared with mixed-integer programs and standard heuristics. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 13- and 123-bus feeders with mixed hurricane/flood scenarios.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a customized microgrid planning algorithm and tool, HyMGP, for remote sites in arid regions, which is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. HyMGP is compared with HOMER Pro to evaluate its performance in optimizing the sizing of microgrid components, including photovoltaic panels (PVs), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), for remote and off-grid applications. The study focuses on a standalone microgrid in the Saudi Arabia, considering high solar irradiance, limited wind availability, and a constant load profile composed of continuous cathodic protection and daytime cooling. In the simulation environment, comparisons with HOMER solutions demonstrate the advantages of HyMGP, which provides optimal and more flexible solutions by allowing user-defined component specifications and strictly enforcing all constraints. Further analysis shows that incorporating wind turbines reduces the Net Present Cost (NPC) by decreasing the required PV and battery capacities. Increasing battery autonomy leads to a higher NPC in both PV-only and hybrid systems due to the need for larger storage. Finally, lithium iron phosphate (Li-ion LFP) batteries are found to be more cost effective than lead acid, offering lower NPCs due to their longer lifespan, deeper discharge capability, and fewer replacement cycles.</p>

            <h2>Safe Trajectory Gradient Flow Control of a Grid-Interfacing Inverter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>Grid-interfacing inverters serve as the interface between renewable energy resources and the electric power grid, offering fast, programmable control capabilities. However, their operation is constrained by hardware limitations, such as bounds on the current magnitude. Existing control methods for these systems often neglect these constraints during controller design and instead rely on ad hoc limiters, which can introduce instability or degrade performance. In this work, we present a control framework that directly incorporates constraints into the control of a voltage-source inverter. We propose a safe trajectory gradient flow controller, which applies the safe gradient flow method to a rolling horizon trajectory optimization problem to ensure that the states remain within a safe set defined by the constraints while directing the trajectory towards an optimal equilibrium point of a nonlinear program. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can drive the outputs of a simulated inverter system to optimal values and maintain state constraints, even when using a limited number of optimization steps per control cycle.</p>

            <p>Smart inverters are instrumental in the integration of distributed energy resources into the electric grid. Such inverters rely on communication layers for continuous control and monitoring, potentially exposing them to cyber-physical attacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). We propose to construct a defense strategy against a priori unknown FDIAs with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The first agent is an adversary that simulates and discovers various FDIA strategies, while the second agent is a defender in charge of detecting and locating FDIAs. This approach enables the defender to be trained against new FDIAs continuously generated by the adversary. In addition, we show that the detection skills of an MARL defender can be combined with those of a supervised offline defender through a transfer learning approach. Numerical experiments conducted on a distribution and transmission system demonstrate that: a) the proposed MARL defender outperforms the offline defender against adversarial attacks; b) the transfer learning approach makes the MARL defender capable against both synthetic and unseen FDIAs.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</p>

Our results demonstrate fundamental limitations of direct fringe-to-depth mapping without explicit phase information, with reconstruction errors approaching 75-95\% of the typical object depth range.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayda Nodel Hokmabadi, Chadi Assi</p>
            <p>Full-duplex communication substantially enhances spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception on the same time-frequency resources. However, its practical deployment remains hindered by strong residual self-interference and inter-user interference, which severely degrade system performance. This work investigates a full-duplex MISO network that leverages movable-antenna base stations (MA-BS) and movable-element reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ME-RIS) to overcome these limitations in next-generation 6G systems. Unlike conventional fixed-geometry architectures, the proposed framework jointly optimizes antenna and RIS element positions, together with RIS phase shifts, to strengthen desired links while suppressing interference. Our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate through the joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming vectors, uplink transmit powers, RIS phase shifts, and the spatial locations of both the BS antennas and RIS elements. To solve this challenging nonconvex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, employing semidefinite relaxation for beamforming design and successive convex approximation for position optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ME-RIS-assisted architecture with movable BS antennas offers substantial gains over conventional fixed-position full-duplex networks. These findings highlight the potential of integrating movable antennas with movable RIS elements as a key enabler for high-performance full-duplex operation in future 6G wireless systems.</p>

Considering imperfect channel information availability and realistic frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's element response, we devise a distributed optimization approach based on consensus updates for the RISs' phase configurations. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed distributed design is superior to centralized schemes that are based on various Lorentzian-type wideband modeling approaches for the RISs.</p>

            <p>The Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) defined in the 3GPP latest Release enables traffic flow over the multiple access paths to achieve the lower-latency End-to-end (E2E) delivery for 6G time-sensitive services.

This proposes a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-aided E2E multi-path uplink(UL) transmission architecture that explicitly accounts for both radio link latency and N3 backhaul latency, via the coupled designs of the UL traffic-splitting ratio, transmit power, receive combining, and RIS phase shift under practical constraints to achieve the minimum average E2E latency. We develop an alternating optimization framework that updates the above target parameters to be optimized. The simulations were conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed E2E optimization framework that lowers the average E2E latency up to 43% for a single user and 15% for the whole system compared with baselines.</p>

            <p>Reliable river flow forecasting is an essential component of flood risk management and early warning systems. It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs. These findings highlight the potential of integrating hydrological understanding with efficient machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of operational flood forecasting, and outline future directions for hybrid hydrological-machine learning model development.</p>

            <p>Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides high-resolution electricity consumption data that can enhance monitoring, diagnosis, and decision making in modern power distribution systems. Detecting anomalies in these time-series measurements is challenging due to nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-scale temporal behavior across diverse building types and operating conditions. This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89. These findings highlight the potential of adversarial temporal modeling as a practical tool for supporting asset monitoring, non-technical loss detection, and situational awareness in real-world power distribution networks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jochen Stiasny, Jochen Cremer</p>
            <p>The energy transition challenges operational tasks based on simulations and optimisation. These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF.</p>

            <p>The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paritosh Ramanan, H.M. Mohaimanul Islam, Abhiram Reddy Alugula</p>
            <p>Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p>

            <h2>DRL-based Power Allocation in LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed A. Hassan, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir Elgorashi, Jaafar Elmirghani</p>
            <p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for optical wireless communication (OWC), enabling multiple users to share the optical spectrum simultaneously through the power domain. However, the imperfection of channel state information (CSI) and residual errors in decoding process deteriorate the performance of NOMA, especially when multi-parameteric and realistic dense-user indoor scenarios are considered. In this work, we model a LiDAL-assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC system, where the light detection and localization (LiDAL) technique exploits spatio-temporal information to improve user CSI, while random linear network coding (RLNC) enhances data resilience in the NOMA successive decoding process. Power allocation (PA) is a crucial issue in communication systems, particularly in the modeled system, due to the complex interactions between multiple users and the coding and detection processes. However, optimizing continuous PA dynamically requires advanced techniques to avoid excessive computational complexity. Therefore, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to efficiently learn near-optimal power allocation strategies, enabling enhanced system performance. In particular, a DRL-based normalized advantage function (NAF) algorithm is proposed to maximize the average sum rate of the system, and its performance is analyzed and compared to other widely used DRL-based and conventional PA schemes, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), gain ratio PA (GRPA), and exhaustive search.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Cooling and Compute Management for AI Datacenters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nardos Belay Abera, Yize Chen</p>
            <p>The AI datacenters are currently being deployed on a large scale to support the training and deployment of power-intensive large-language models (LLMs). Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs. Using real Azure inference traces and detailed GPU profiling, our model balances serving latency and thermal constraints in AI datacenters while significantly improving AI datacenters' energy efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Blockchain-Enabled Renewable Energy Certificate Trading: A Secure and Privacy-Preserving Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Jen Liu, Wei-Yu Chiu, Weiqi Hua</p>
            <p>In the 21st century, transitioning to renewable energy sources is imperative, with fossil fuel reserves depleting rapidly and recognizing critical environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Embracing renewable energy is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic move with multiple benefits. By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information. Our results demonstrate lower transaction time by 41\% and energy consumption by 65\% compared to proof-of-stake.</p>

            <h2>Multiobjective Model Predictive Control for Residential Demand Response Management Under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guan-Ting Lin, Wei-Yu Chiu, Chien-Feng Wu, Asef Nazari, Dhananjay Thiruvady</p>
            <p>Residential users in demand response programs must balance electricity costs and user dissatisfaction under real-time pricing. This study proposes a multiobjective model predictive control approach for home energy management systems with battery storage, aiming to minimize both objectives while mitigating uncertainties. Laguerre functions parameterize control signals, transforming the optimization problem into one with linear inequalities for efficient exploration. A constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, incorporating convex sampler-based crossover and mutation, is developed to ensure feasible solutions. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, limiting cost increases to 0.52\% under uncertainties, compared to at least 2.3\% with other methods.</p>

            <h2>Current and temperature imbalances in parallel-connected grid storage battery modules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Ross, Damien Frost, Stratos Chatzinikolaou, Stephen Duncan, David Howey</p>
            <p>A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.</p>

            <h2>Grid-Aware Charging and Operational Optimization for Mixed-Fleet Public Transit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishav Sen, Amutheezan Sivagnanam, Aron Laszka, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.</p>

            <h2>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Xianbin Wang, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</p>

            <h2>Dual radar-guided glide path error correction based on the Izhikevich neuron model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gao, Xinyu Wang, Yifan Ren, Yuning Zhou, Ziwei Wang</p>
            <p>Aiming at the ranging and angle measurement errors caused by target reflection characteristics and system noise in dual radar tracking, this paper proposes a dual radar track error correction method based on the Izhikevich neural model. The network uses the dynamic differential equation of the Izhikevich model to simulate the discharge characteristics of biological neurons. Its input layer integrates the coordinate measurement data of the dual radar, and the output layer represents the error compensation amount through the pulse emission frequency. The spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is used to adjust the neuron connection weights dynamically, and the trajectory distortion caused by system noise and radar ranging and angle measurement errors can be effectively suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing the 4G--5G Migration: A Simulation-Driven Roadmap for Emerging Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Desire Guel, Justin Pegd-Windé Kouraogo, Kouka Kouakou Nakoulma</p>
            <p>Deploying fifth-generation (5G) networks in emerging markets demands a balance between performance targets and constraints in budget, spectrum, and infrastructure. We use MATLAB simulations to quantify how radio and architectural levers - MIMO (beamforming, diversity, spatial multiplexing), carrier aggregation (CA), targeted spectrum refarming to New Radio (NR), mmWave propagation with blockage/rain, and Non-Standalone (NSA) versus Standalone (SA) cores - affect capacity, coverage, latency, and interference robustness, with D2D and M2M as complements to wide-area access. Beamforming improves cell-edge SNR by about 3-6 dB, while spatial multiplexing dominates at moderate/high SNR via multi-stream gains. Throughput scales strongly with CA: increasing from 1 to 5x20-MHz carriers raises peak rate from about 200 Mb/s to about 1 Gb/s at 30 dB SNR; water-filling adds 5-12% over equal power at mid-SNR. Targeted mid-band refarming to NR increases median throughput by 60-90% in urban and 40-70% in rural scenarios when sub-1-GHz layers preserve coverage. At 28 GHz, rain and human blockage add about 8-30 dB excess loss, so viable mmWave deployment concentrates in LOS hot zones with narrow-beam arrays and short inter-site distances. NSA delivers broader initial coverage than SA by reusing LTE/EPC, while SA becomes attractive as transport improves (e.g., >= 10 Gb/s and < 5 ms RTT) and site density grows. We synthesize these results into a practical roadmap: start NR on NSA, prioritize CA-centric spectrum strategies with focused refarming, densify selectively in demand hotspots, and migrate to SA as backhaul and device ecosystems mature.</p>

            <h2>Control and Stability of a Multilevel Power System for a Future Distribution Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Wu, Jan H. van Schuppen, Hai Xiang Lin</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks poses significant challenges to frequency and voltage stability due to their intermittent nature and low-inertia dynamics. This paper proposes a multilevel control framework for a future decarbonized power system, using energy storage systems as power buffers to mitigate frequency and voltage fluctuations. A nonlinear interconnected model is formulated to characterize the complex dynamics across multiple levels of the distribution network. To reduce operational complexity and communication overhead of these dynamics, a distributed linear quadratic regulator control strategy is developed for information exchange in a bottom-up approach, where each level implements local feedback control within a short time horizon. Stability conditions for both open-loop and closed-loop systems are established using Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition, explicit performance bounds are derived to quantify the optimal difference between the proposed distributed strategy and the centralized control method, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Power-Water Coordination: Unlocking Flexibility in Hybrid RO Desalination Plants via Variable-Speed Pumps and Tank Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongxing Hu, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>Water desalination plants (DPs) are among the most critical infrastructures and largest electricity loads in water-scarce regions worldwide. Although reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is the most energy-efficient and dominant technology, it remains energy-intensive but can offer substantial flexibility potential for power systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation framework for power systems and DPs that explicitly accounts for both systems' operational constraints and fully unlocks DP flexibility. To achieve this, a detailed DP model is developed, incorporating the characteristics of an actual high-pressure pump with variable-speed operation, on-off operation with flushing requirements, water quality constraints, and water dynamics and salt mixing in the storage tank. By proactively managing freshwater storage and tank salinity in a closed-loop coordinated scheduling framework, the operational flexibility of the DP is significantly enhanced. With appropriate simplification and linearization, the resulting coordinated scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and a two-step decomposed commitment-scheduling stochastic optimization (TDCSO) is proposed to efficiently address uncertainties. Case studies validate the proposed approach and demonstrate up to a 6% operating cost reduction.</p>

            <h2>Next-Generation Grid Codes: Toward a New Paradigm for Dynamic Ancillary Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Kehao Zhuang, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Hardware-Impaired Wireless Fronthaul</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) enhances spectral and energy efficiency compared to conventional cellular networks by enabling joint transmission and reception across a large number of distributed access points (APs). Since these APs are envisioned to be low-cost and densely deployed, hardware impairments, stemming from non-ideal radio-frequency (RF) chains, are unavoidable. While existing studies primarily address hardware impairments on the access side, the impact of hardware impairments on the wireless fronthaul link has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we fill this important gap by introducing a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless fronthauling scheme tailored for cell-free massive MIMO. Focusing on the uplink, we develop an analytical framework that jointly models the hardware impairments at both the APs and the fronthaul transceivers, derives the resulting end-to-end distorted signal expression, and quantifies the individual contribution of each impairment to the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we design distortion-aware linear combiners that optimally mitigate these effects. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains from distortion-aware processing and illustrate the potential of the proposed AF fronthauling scheme as a cost-effective enabler for future cell-free architectures.</p>

            <h2>Joint Impact of ADC and Fronthaul Quantization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>In the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system, quantization affects performance in two key domains: the time-domain distortion introduced by finite-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the access points (APs), and the fronthaul quantization of signals sent to the central processing unit (CPU). Although quantizing twice may seem redundant, the ADC quantization in orthogonal frequency-division duplex (OFDM) systems appears in the time domain, and one must then convert to the frequency domain, where quantization can be applied only to the signals at active subcarriers. This reduces fronthaul load and avoids unnecessary distortion, since the ADC output spans all OFDM samples while only a subset of subcarriers carries useful information. While both quantization effects have been extensively studied in narrowband systems, their joint impact in practical wideband OFDM-based cell-free massive MIMO remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the gap by modeling the joint distortion and proposing a fronthaul strategy in which each AP processes the received signal to reduce quantization artifacts before transmission. We develop an efficient estimation algorithm that reconstructs the unquantized time-domain signal prior to fronthaul transmission and evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed design offers new insights for implementing efficient, quantization-aware uplink transmission in wideband cell-free architectures.</p>

            <h2>Coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Control of Point Absorbers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhan, Iván Martínez-Estévez, Min Luo, Alejandro J.C. Crespo, Abbas Khayyer</p>
            <p>Wave Energy Converters, particularly point absorbers, have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for harvesting ocean wave energy. Nevertheless, achieving high conversion efficiency remains challenging due to the inherently complex and nonlinear interactions between incident waves and device motion dynamics. This study develops an optimal adaptive damping control model for the power take-off (PTO) system by coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables real-time communication between high-fidelity SPH simulations and intelligent control agents that learn coordinated policies to maximise energy capture. In each training episode, the SPH-based environment provides instantaneous hydrodynamic states to the agents, which output continuous damping actions and receive rewards reflecting power absorption. The Multi-Agent Soft Actor Critic algorithm is employed within a centralised-training and decentralised-execution scheme to ensure stable learning in continuous, multi-body systems. The entire platform is implemented in a unified GPU-accelerated C++ environment, allowing long-horizon training and large-scale three-dimensional simulations. The approach is validated through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark cases under regular and irregular wave conditions. Compared with constant PTO damping, the learned control policy increases overall energy capture by 23.8% and 21.5%, respectively, demonstrating the strong potential of intelligent control for improving the performance of wave energy converter arrays. The developed three-dimensional GPU-accelerated multi-agent platform in computational hydrodynamics, is extendable to other fluid-structure interaction engineering problem that require real-time, multi-body coordinated control.</p>

The study particularly focuses on AI-driven innovations in coding theory, which offer advanced solutions to the limitations of conventional error correction and modulation techniques. By employing deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neural network-based approaches, this research demonstrates significant advancements in error correction performance, decoding efficiency, and adaptive transmission strategies. Additionally, the integration of AI with emerging technologies, such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output, intelligent reflecting surfaces, and privacy-enhancing mechanisms, is discussed, highlighting their potential to propel the next generation of wireless networks.

            <h2>Performance Analysis for Wireless Localization with Random Sensor Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengqi Ma, Aihua Xia</p>
            <p>Accurate wireless localization underpins applications from autonomous systems to smart infrastructure. We study the mean-squared error (MSE) and conditional MSE (CMSE) of a practical fusion-based estimator in d-dimensional, stationary isotropic (translation- and rotation-invariant) random sensor networks, where a central processor combines received-signal-strength (RSS) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements to infer a target's position. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish an approximation theorem: when measurement noise is sufficiently large, the joint law of RSS and AOA observations under a broad class of stationary isotropic deployments is, in distribution, indistinguishable from that induced by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Second, leveraging this equivalence, we investigate a homogeneous PPP-based sensor network. We propose a fusion-based estimator in which a central processor aggregates RSS and AOA measurements from a set of spatially distributed sensors to infer the target position. For this PPP deployment within a finite observation region, we derive tractable analytical upper bounds for both the MSE and CMSE, establishing explicit scaling laws with respect to sensor density, observation radius, and noise variance. The approximation theorem then certifies these PPP-based bounds as reasonable proxies for non-Poisson deployments in noisy regimes. Overall, the results translate deployment and sensing parameters into achievable accuracy targets and provide robust, cost-aware guidance for the design of next-generation location-aware wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Nirjhar Alam, Wesley Reinhart, Rebecca Napolitano</p>
            <p>Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) combines depth resolution, non-destructive operation, and broad material sensitivity, yet it has seen limited use in diagnosing building envelopes. The compact geometry of wall assemblies, where reflections from closely spaced studs, sheathing, and cladding strongly overlap, has made systematic inversion difficult. Recent advances in data-driven interpretation provide an opportunity to revisit this challenge and assess whether machine learning can reliably extract structural information from such complex signals. Here, we develop a GPR-based inversion framework that decomposes wall diagnostics into classification tasks addressing vertical (stud presence) and lateral (wall-type) variations. Alongside model development, we implement multiple feature minimization strategies - including recursive elimination, agglomerative clustering, and L0-based sparsity - to promote fidelity and interpretability. Among these approaches, the L0-based sparse neural network (SparseNN) emerges as particularly effective: it exceeds Random Forest accuracy while relying on only a fraction of the input features, each linked to identifiable dielectric interfaces. SHAP analysis further confirms that the SparseNN learns reflection patterns consistent with physical layer boundaries. In summary, this framework establishes a foundation for physically interpretable and data-efficient inversion of wall assemblies using GPR radargrams. Although defect detection is not addressed here, the ability to reconstruct intact envelope structure and isolate features tied to key elements provides a necessary baseline for future inversion and anomaly-analysis tasks.</p>

            <h2>A Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling and Sensor/Actuator Placement Framework for Flexible Spacecraft</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Hilsenrath, Daniel R. Herber</p>
            <p>Flexible spacecraft structures present significant challenges for physical and control system design due to nonlinear dynamics, mission constraints, environmental variables, and changing operational conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for constructing reduced-order surrogate models of a flexible spacecraft using the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), followed by optimal sensor/actuator pair placement. Highfidelity simulation data from a nonlinear flexible spacecraft model, including coupled rigid-body and elastic modes, are captured by defining a mesh of nodes over the spacecraft body. The data-driven methods are then used to construct a modal model from the time histories of these node points. Optimal sensor/actuator placement for controllability and observability is performed via a nonlinear programming technique that maximizes the singular values of the Hankel matrix. Finally, the sensor placement and dynamics modeling approach is iterated to account for changes in the dynamic system introduced by sensor/actuator physical mass. The proposed methodology enables initialization of physical modeling without requiring a direct analytical model and provides a practical solution for onboard implementation in model-based control and estimation systems. Results demonstrate optimal design methodology with substantial model-order reduction while preserving dynamic fidelity, and provide insight into effective sensor-actuator configurations for estimation and control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Selin Ezgi Ozcan, Mustafa Mert Ankarali</p>
            <p>Koopman operator recently gained increasing attention in the control systems community for its abilities to bridge linear and nonlinear systems. Data driven Koopman operator approximations have established themselves as key enablers for system identification and model predictive control. Nonetheless, such methods commonly entail a preselected definition of states in the function space leading to high dimensional overfitting models and degraded long term prediction performances. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical probabilistic approach for the Koopman model identification problem. In our method, elements of the model are treated as random variables and the posterior estimates are found using variational Bayesian (VB) inference updates. Our model distinguishes from others in the integration of inclusion flags. By the help of the inclusion flags, we intuitively threshold the probability of each state in the model. We then propose a graph search based algorithm to reduce the preselected states of the Koopman model. We demonstrate that our reduction method overcomes numerical instabilities and the reduced models maintain performance in simulated and real experiments.</p>

            <h2>Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Darvishi</p>
            <p>Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.</p>

This paper presents an experimental comparison of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA across multiple block sizes and compression rates. Using rate distortion and energy compaction analysis, we show that PCA outperforms fixed transforms only when block dimensionality is sufficiently large, while DCT remains near optimal for standard block sizes such as $8\times8$ and at low bit rates. These results explain the robustness of DCT in practical codecs and highlight the limitations of block wise learned transforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soundes Oumaima Boufaida, Abdemadjid Benmachiche, Majda Maatallah</p>
            <p>Embedded vision systems need efficient and robust image processing algorithms to perform real-time, with resource-constrained hardware. This research investigates image processing algorithms, specifically edge detection, corner detection, and blob detection, that are implemented on embedded processors, including DSPs and FPGAs. To address latency, accuracy and power consumption noted in the image processing literature, optimized algorithm architectures and quantization techniques are employed. In addition, optimal techniques for inter-frame redundancy removal and adaptive frame averaging are used to improve throughput with reasonable image quality. Simulations and hardware trials of the proposed approaches show marked improvements in the speed and energy efficiency of processing as compared to conventional implementations. The advances of this research facilitate a path for scalable and inexpensive embedded imaging systems for the automotive, surveillance, and robotics sectors, and underscore the benefit of co-designing algorithms and hardware architectures for practical real-time embedded vision applications.</p>

            <h2>FastSLM: Hierarchical Frame Q-Former for Effective Speech Modality Adaptation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junseok Lee, Sangyong Lee, Chang-Jae Chun</p>
            <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-expert-level capabilities, driving significant interest in their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In particular, there is growing momentum in adapting LLMs to various modalities, including vision, video, and speech, through the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, existing speech-language model (SLM) research has largely overlooked cost-effective adaptation strategies for leveraging LLMs in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

            <h2>Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Video Transmission with Asymmetric Context</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuechen Chen, Junting Li, Chuang Chen, Hairong Lin, Yishen Li</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a high-efficiency deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for video transmission based on conditional coding with asymmetric context. The conditional coding-based neural video compression requires to predict the encoding and decoding conditions from the same context which includes the same reconstructed frames. However in JSCC schemes which fall into pseudo-analog transmission, the encoder cannot infer the same reconstructed frames as the decoder even a pipeline of the simulated transmission is constructed at the encoder. In the proposed method, without such a pipeline, we guide and design neural networks to learn encoding and decoding conditions from asymmetric contexts. Additionally, we introduce feature propagation, which allows intermediate features to be independently propagated at the encoder and decoder and help to generate conditions, enabling the framework to greatly leverage temporal correlation while mitigating the problem of error accumulation. To further exploit the performance of the proposed transmission framework, we implement content-adaptive coding which achieves variable bandwidth transmission using entropy models and masking mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep video transmission frameworks in terms of performance and effectively mitigates the error accumulation. By mitigating the error accumulation, our schemes can reduce the frequency of inserting intra-frame coding modes, further enhancing performance.</p>

            <h2>Auditory Filter Behavior and Updated Estimated Constants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samiya A Alkhairy</p>
            <p>Filters from the Gammatone family are often used to model auditory signal processing, but the filter constant values used to mimic human hearing are largely set to values based on historical psychoacoustic data collected several decades ago. Here, we move away from this long-standing convention, and estimate filter constants using a range of more recent reported filter characteristics (such as quality factors and ratios between quality factors and peak group delay) within a characteristics-based framework that clarifies how filter behavior is related to the underlying constants. Using a sharp-filter approximation that captures shared peak-region behavior across certain classes of filters, we analyze the range of behaviors accessible when the full degrees of freedom of the filter are utilized rather than fixing the filter order or exponent to historically prescribed values. Filter behavior is characterized using magnitude-based and phase-based characteristics and their ratios, which reveal which characteristics are informative for constraining filter constants and which are only weakly constraining. We show that these insights and estimation methods extend to multiple realizable filter classes from the Gammatone family and apply them, together with recent physiological and psychoacoustic observations, to derive constraints on and estimates for filter constants for human auditory filters. More broadly, this framework supports the design of auditory filters with arbitrary characteristic-level specifications and enables systematic assessment of how variations in filter characteristics influence auditory models, perceptual findings, and technologies that rely on auditory filterbanks.</p>

            <h2>TagSpeech: End-to-End Multi-Speaker ASR and Diarization with Fine-Grained Temporal Grounding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyue Huo, Yiwen Shao, Yuheng Zhang</p>
            <p>We present TagSpeech, a unified LLM-based framework that utilizes Temporal Anchor Grounding for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization. The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Fontanella, Kristjan Milic, Alan Facchinetti, Sara Muggiasca, Marco Belloli</p>
            <p>Wake interactions in floating wind farms are inherently coupled to platform motion, yet most experimental studies to date neglect this two-way coupling by prescribing platform movements. This work presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind-tunnel methodology to investigate wake interactions between two floating wind turbines with fully coupled aerodynamic loading and platform dynamics. The approach integrates physical wind-tunnel testing of two scaled rotors with a real-time numerical model that accounts for platform motion, mooring restoring forces, and hydrodynamic loads. Experiments conducted under low-turbulence inflow conditions show that a downstream turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine experiences reduced mean thrust and platform deflections due to the decreased inflow velocity, alongside enhanced low-frequency platform motions driven by increased turbulent energy in the wake. The proposed HIL framework provides a controlled experimental basis for studying wake-induced excitation mechanisms and supports the validation of floating wind farm models and control strategies.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Energy Landscape Model for Analyzing Brain State Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Triet M. Tran, Seyed Majid Razavi, Dee H. Wu, Sina Khanmohammadi</p>
            <p>Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.</p>

            <h2>DIVINE: Coordinating Multimodal Disentangled Representations for Oro-Facial Neurological Disorder Assessment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Muskaan Singh</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a multimodal framework for predicting neuro-facial disorders by capturing both vocal and facial cues. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio- only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Farhan Sheth, Muskaan Singh</p>
            <p>We propose a unified framework for not only attributing synthetic speech to its source but also for detecting speech generated by synthesizers that were not encountered during training. This requires methods that move beyond simple detection to support both detailed forensic analysis and open-set generalization. To address this, we introduce SIGNAL, a hybrid framework that combines speech foundation models (SFMs) with graph-based modeling and open-set-aware inference. Our framework integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, allowing it to capture meaningful relationships between utterances and recognize speech that doesn`t belong to any known generator. It constructs a query-conditioned graph over generator class prototypes, enabling the GNN to reason over relationships among candidate generators, while the KNN branch supports open-set detection via confidence-based thresholding. We evaluate SIGNAL using the DiffSSD dataset, which offers a diverse mix of real speech and synthetic audio from both open-source and commercial diffusion-based TTS systems. To further assess generalization, we also test on the SingFake benchmark. Our results show that SIGNAL consistently improves performance across both tasks, with Mamba-based embeddings delivering especially strong results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to unify graph-based learning and open-set detection for tracing synthetic speech back to its origin.</p>

            <p>This study presents an effective autofocusing approach for synthetic aperture radar imaging of the human body under conditions of respiratory motion. The proposed method suppresses respiratory-motion-induced phase errors by separating radar echoes in the spatial- and time-frequency domains and estimating phase errors individually for each separated echo. By compensating for the estimated phase errors, synthetic aperture radar images focused on all scattering points are generated, even when multiple body parts exhibit different motions due to respiration. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments with four participants in the supine position. Compared with a conventional method, the proposed approach improves image quality by a factor of 5.1 in terms of Muller-Buffington sharpness, and reduces the root-mean-square error with respect to a reference point cloud from 34 mm to 20 mm.</p>

            <h2>Digital Twin for Ultra-Reliable & Low-Latency 6G Wireless Communications in Dense Urban City</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
            <p>High-frequency deployments in dense cities are difficult to plan because coverage, interference, and service reliability depend sensitively on local morphology. This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Aware LoRaWAN Gateway Placement in Dense Urban Cities Using Digital Twins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
            <p>LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required.</p>

            <p>This paper deals with analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant control and attack-resilient of cyber-physical control systems. In our recent work, it has been observed that an attack detector driven by an input residual signal is capable of reliably detecting attacks. In particular, observing system dynamics from the perspective of the system input-output signal space reveals that attacks and system uncertainties act on different system subspaces. These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection. The unified framework is proposed to handle control and detection issues uniformly and in subspaces of system input-output data. Its mathematical and control-theoretic basis is system coprime factorizations with Bezout identity at its core. We firstly explore those methods and schemes of the unified framework, which serve as the major control-theoretic tool in our work. It is followed by re-visiting and examining established attack detection and resilient control schemes. The major part of our work is the endeavours to develop a control-theoretic paradigm, in which analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant and attack-resilient control of cyber-physical control systems are addressed in a unified manner.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the problem of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for rigid body systems evolving in three-dimensional space. We introduce a novel matrix Lie group structure, denoted SE_{3+n}(3), that unifies the pose, gravity, linear velocity, and landmark positions within a consistent geometric framework tailored to the VIO problem. Building upon this formulation, we design an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that tightly integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual sensors. Unlike conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimators that rely on local linearization and thus ensure only local convergence, the proposed observer achieves almost global stability through the decoupling of the rotational and translational dynamics. A globally exponentially stable Riccati-based translational observer along with an almost global input-to-state stable attitude observer are designed such that the overall cascaded observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability. This cascaded architecture guarantees robust and consistent estimation of the extended state, including orientation, position, velocity, gravity, and landmark positions, up to the VIO unobservable directions (i.e., a global translation and rotation about gravity). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations as well as experimental validation on the EuRoC MAV dataset, highlighting its robustness and suitability for real-world VIO applications.</p>

            <p>Computed Laminography (CL) is a key non-destructive testing technology for the visualization of internal structures in large planar objects. The inherent scanning geometry of CL inevitably results in inter-layer aliasing artifacts, limiting its practical application, particularly in electronic component inspection. While deep learning (DL) provides a powerful paradigm for artifact removal, its effectiveness is often limited by the domain gap between synthetic data and real-world data. In this work, we present LaminoDiff, a framework to integrate a diffusion model with a high-fidelity prior representation to bridge the domain gap in CL imaging. This prior, generated via a dual-modal CT-CL fusion strategy, is integrated into the proposed network as a conditional constraint. This integration ensures high-precision preservation of circuit structures and geometric fidelity while suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real PCB datasets demonstrate that LaminoDiff achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with competitive performance in artifact suppression and detail recovery. More importantly, the results facilitate reliable automated defect recognition.</p>

            <p>We investigate antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The objective is to enhance the output direct current (DC) power under RF combining and DC combining schemes by jointly exploiting gains from antenna coding, beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity. We first propose the MIMO WPT system model with binary and continuous antenna coding using the beamspace channel model and formulate the joint antenna coding and beamforming optimization using a nonlinear rectenna model. We propose two efficient closed-form successive convex approximation algorithms to efficiently optimize the beamforming. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose codebook-based antenna coding designs for output DC power maximization based on K-means clustering. Results show that the proposed pixel antenna empowered MIMO WPT system with binary antenna coding increases output DC power by more than 15 dB compared with conventional systems with fixed antenna configuration. With continuous antenna coding, the performance improves another 6 dB. Moreover, the proposed codebook design outperforms previous designs by up to 40% and shows good performance with reduced computational complexity. Overall, the significant improvement in output DC power verifies the potential of leveraging antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas to enhance WPT systems.</p>

            <p>Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoshi Hoshika, Takahiro Iwami, Akira Omoto</p>
            <p>This study proposes a framework for incorporating wavenumber-domain acoustic reflection coefficients into sound field analysis to characterize direction-dependent material reflection and scattering phenomena. The reflection coefficient is defined as the amplitude ratio between incident and reflected waves for each propagation direction and is estimated from spatial Fourier transforms of the incident and reflected sound fields. The resulting wavenumber-domain reflection coefficients are converted into an acoustic admittance representation that is directly compatible with numerical methods such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM), enabling simulation of reflections beyond simple specular components. Unlike conventional extended reaction models, the proposed approach avoids explicit modeling of the material interior. This significantly reduces computational cost while allowing direct use of measured data, empirical models, or user-defined directional reflection characteristics. The validity of the proposed formulation was previously demonstrated by the authors through two-dimensional sound field simulations, in which accurate reproduction of direction-dependent reflection behavior was confirmed. In the present work, the framework is extended to three-dimensional analysis, demonstrating its applicability to more realistic and complex acoustic environments. The proposed approach provides a practical and flexible tool for simulating direction-dependent acoustic reflections and scattering, with potential applications in architectural acoustics, material characterization, and noise control.</p>

We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.</p>

            <p>Electric vehicles with multiple motors provide a flexibility in meeting the driver torque demand, which calls for minimizing the battery energy consumption through torque allocation. In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems.</p>

            <h2>Vector Quantized-Aided XL-MIMO CSI Feedback with Channel Adaptive Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhang Ma, Nan Ma, Jianqiao Chen, Wenkai Liu</p>
            <p>Efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for 6G extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate channel interference. However, the massive antenna scale imposes a severe burden on feedback overhead. Meanwhile, existing quantized feedback methods face dual challenges of limited quantization precision and insufficient channel robustness when compressing high-dimensional channel features into discrete symbols. To reduce these gaps, guided by the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) framework, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-aided scheme for CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems considering the near-field effect, named VQ-DJSCC-F. Firstly, taking advantage of the sparsity of near-field channels in the polar-delay domain, we extract energy-concentrated features to reduce dimensionality. Then, we simultaneously design the Transformer and CNN (convolutional neural network) architectures as the backbones to hierarchically extract CSI features, followed by VQ modules projecting features into a discrete latent space. The entropy loss regularization in synergy with an exponential moving average (EMA) update strategy is introduced to maximize quantization precision. Furthermore, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to mitigate the impact of wireless channel fading on the transmission of index sequences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior CSI reconstruction accuracy with lower feedback overheads under varying channel conditions.</p>

            <h2>Recursive Binary Identification with Differential Privacy and Data Tampering Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimin Wang, Jieming Ke, Jin Guo, Yanlong Zhao</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the parameter estimation in a bandwidth-constrained sensor network communicating through an insecure medium. The sensor performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an estimation center through a wireless medium where the transmission of information is vulnerable to attackers. Both eavesdroppers and data tampering attackers are considered in our setting. A differential privacy method is used to protect the sensitive information against eavesdroppers. Then, a recursive projection algorithm is proposed such that the estimation center achieves the almost sure convergence and mean-square convergence when quantized measurements, differential privacy, and data tampering attacks are considered in a uniform framework. A privacy analysis including the convergence rate with privacy or without privacy is given. Further, we extend the problem to multi-agent systems. For this case, a distributed recursive projection algorithm is proposed with guaranteed almost sure and mean square convergence. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Pulido, Francesc Wilhelmi, Sergio Fortes, Alfonso Fernández-Durán, Lorenzo Galati Giordano, Raquel Barco</p>
            <p>Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Learning to accelerate Krasnosel'skii-Mann fixed-point iterations with guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Martin, Giuseppe Belgioioso</p>
            <p>We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Safe Navigation under Uncertain Obstacle Dynamics using Control Barrier Functions and Constrained Convex Generators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Matias, Daniel Silvestre</p>
            <p>This paper presents a sampled-data framework for the safe navigation of controlled agents in environments cluttered with obstacles governed by uncertain linear dynamics. Collision-free motion is achieved by combining Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety filtering with set-valued state estimation using Constrained Convex Generators (CCGs). At each sampling time, a CCG estimate of each obstacle is obtained using a finite-horizon guaranteed estimation scheme and propagated over the sampling interval to obtain a CCG-valued flow that describes the estimated obstacle evolution. However, since CCGs are defined indirectly - as an affine transformation of a generator set subject to equality constraints, rather than as a sublevel set of a scalar function - converting the estimated obstacle flows into CBFs is a nontrivial task. One of the main contributions of this paper is a procedure to perform this conversion, ultimately yielding a CBF via a convex optimization problem whose validity is established by the Implicit Function Theorem. The resulting obstacle-specific CBFs are then merged into a single CBF that is used to design a safe controller through the standard Quadratic Program (QP)-based approach. Since CCGs support Minkowski sums, the proposed framework also naturally handles rigid-body agents and generalizes existing CBF-based rigid-body navigation designs to arbitrary agent and obstacle geometries. While the main contribution is general, the paper primarily focuses on agents with first-order control-affine dynamics and second-order strict-feedback dynamics. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Matoušek, J. Krejčí, J. Duník, R. Zanetti</p>
            <p>This paper presents a practical and scalable grid-based state estimation method for high-dimensional models with invertible linear dynamics and with highly non-linear measurements, such as the nearly constant velocity model with measurements of e.g. altitude, bearing, and/or range. Unlike previous tensor decomposition-based approaches, which have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, the proposed method delivers an efficient and practical solution by exploiting decomposable model structure-specifically, block-diagonal dynamics and sparsely coupled measurement dimensions. The algorithm integrates a Lagrangian formulation for the time update and leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to compactly represent and effectively propagate state densities. This enables real-time estimation for models with large state dimension, significantly extending the practical reach of grid-based filters beyond their traditional low-dimensional use. Although demonstrated in the context of terrain-aided navigation, the method is applicable to a wide range of models with decomposable structure. The computational complexity and estimation accuracy depend on the specific structure of the model. All experiments are fully reproducible, with source code provided alongside this paper (GitHub link: this https URL).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha</p>
            <p>This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chaoyi Lin Yang, Gabriele Dessena, Oscar E. Bonilla-Manrique</p>
            <p>Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.</p>

            <p>Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</p>

            <p>The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</p>

            <p>Extending large language models (LLMs) to the speech domain has recently gained significant attention. A typical approach connects a pretrained LLM with an audio encoder through a projection module and trains the resulting model on large-scale, task-specific instruction-tuning datasets. However, curating such instruction-tuning data for specific requirements is time-consuming, and models trained in this manner often generalize poorly to unseen tasks. In this work, we first formulate that the strongest generalization of a speech-LLM is achieved when it is trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT), in which supervision signals are generated by a frozen LLM using textual representations of speech as input. Our proposed SIFT paradigm eliminates the need for collecting task-specific question-answer pairs and yields the theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce AZeroS (Auden Zero-instruction-tuned Speech-LLM), which is trained on speech-text pairs derived from publicly available corpora, including approximately 25,000 hours of speech with ASR transcripts and 3,000 hours of speech with paralinguistic labels. Built upon Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the model updates only two lightweight projection modules (23.8 million parameters each), while keeping both the LLM and audio encoders frozen. Despite the minimal training cost and modest data scale, AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks, including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech).</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.</p>

The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations.

We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.</p>

            <h2>Visible Light Communication using Led-Based AR Markers for Robot Localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wataru Uemura, Shogo Kawasaki</p>
            <p>A method of information transmission using visual markers has been widely studied. In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker.</p>

            <h2>Non-volatile Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuits using Mechanically Latched MEMS: A System-Level Scheme Enabling Power-Connection-Free Operation Without Performance Compromise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ran Tao, Jifang Qiu, Zhimeng Liu, Hongxiang Guo, Yan Li, Jian Wu</p>
            <p>Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) offer a versatile platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a generic hardware mesh. However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saleem Ishaq Tijjani, Bogdan Ghita, Nathan Clarke, Matthew Craven</p>
            <p>The detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs) remains a crucial challenge due to their stealthy, multistage nature and the limited availability of realistic, labeled datasets for systematic evaluation. Synthetic dataset generation has emerged as a practical approach for modeling APT campaigns; however, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive alert correlation mechanisms that limit scalability. Motivated by these limitations, this paper presents a near realistic synthetic APT dataset and an efficient alert correlation framework. The proposed approach introduces a machine learning based correlation module that employs K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering with a cosine similarity metric to group semantically related alerts within a temporal context. The dataset emulates multistage APT campaigns across campus and organizational network environments and captures a diverse set of fourteen distinct alert types, exceeding the coverage of commonly used synthetic APT datasets. In addition, explicit APT campaign states and alert to stage mappings are defined to enable flexible integration of new alert types and support stage aware analysis. A comprehensive statistical characterization of the dataset is provided to facilitate reproducibility and support APT stage predictions.</p>

            <h2>Water Demand Maximization: Quick Recovery of Nonlinear Physics Solutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sai Krishna Kanth Hari, Russell Bent</p>
            <p>Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.</p>

            <p>Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.</p>

            <h2>qAttCNN - Self Attention Mechanism for Video QoE Prediction in Encrypted Traffic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Sidorov, Ofer Hadar</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.</p>

            <h2>Directional Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control Based on a Convolutional Neural Network in Reverberant Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxiang Wang, Zhengding Luo, Haowen Li, Dongyuan Shi, Junwei Ji, Ziyi Yang, Woon-Seng Gan</p>
            <p>Selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) is a novel approach capable of mitigating noise with varying frequency characteristics. It offers faster response and greater computational efficiency compared to traditional adaptive algorithms. However, spatial factors, particularly the influence of the noise source location, are often overlooked. Some existing studies have explored the impact of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the noise source on ANC performance, but they are mostly limited to free-field conditions and do not consider the more complex indoor reverberant environments. To address this gap, this paper proposes a learning-based directional SFANC method that incorporates the DoA of the noise source in reverberant environments. In this framework, multiple reference signals are processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the azimuth and elevation angles of the noise source, as well as to identify the most appropriate control filter for effective noise cancellation. Compared to traditional adaptive algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior noise reduction with shorter response times, even in the presence of reverberations.</p>

Neuromorphic computing is then applied to FPGA design for digital signal processing (DSP).

The results suggest that neuromorphic computing can provide low-latency and synaptic plasticity thereby enabling continuous on-chip learning. Due to their parallel and event-driven nature, neuromorphic computing can reduce power consumption by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and improve efficiency, but at the cost of reduced numeric precision.</p>

            <p>Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.</p>

            <p>The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Compatible Dictionary Learning via Doubly Sparse Models</h2>

            <p>Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at this https URL. The goal is not to claim exponential speedups, but to realign dictionary learning with the realities of near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

            <p>Smart contract technology facilitates self-executing agreements on the blockchain, eliminating dependency on an external trusted authority. However, smart contracts may expose vulnerabilities that can lead to financial losses and disruptions in decentralized applications. In this work, we evaluate deep learning-based approaches for vulnerability scanning of Ethereum smart contracts. We propose VASCOT, a Vulnerability Analyzer for Smart COntracts using Transformers, which performs sequential analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and incorporates a sliding window mechanism to overcome input length constraints. To assess VASCOT's detection efficacy, we construct a dataset of 16,469 verified Ethereum contracts deployed in 2022, and annotate it using trace analysis with concrete validation to mitigate false positives. VASCOT's performance is then compared against a state-of-the-art LSTM-based vulnerability detection model on both our dataset and an older public dataset. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, providing insights into their detection capabilities and generalizability.</p>

            <p>Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).</p>

            <p>FR3 ($\approx$7-24 GHz), also referred to as the upper mid-band, has recently emerged as promising spectrum for 6G; however, its propagation and MIMO characteristics vary significantly with frequency and environment, and spectrum availability may be intermittent due to incumbents. Using site-specific ray tracing (Sionna RT) in representative indoor and outdoor scenarios, we evaluate 7, 10, 14, 20, and 24 GHz under SISO and MIMO configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies.</p>

            <p>Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyang Feng, Hanlin Sun, Yu Marco Nie, Jun Xie, Jiayang Li</p>
            <p>Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.</p>

Given a finite-time horizon, if the system is safe, it, starting from a compact initial set, will remain within an open and bounded safe region throughout the specified time horizon, regardless of the disturbances. The main contribution of this work is a converse theorem: we prove that a continuously differentiable, time-dependent barrier certificate exists if and only if the system is safe over the finite-time horizon. The existence problem is explored by finding a continuously differentiable approximation of a unique Lipschitz viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</p>

            <p>When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</p>

Conventional TdSV approaches typically jointly model speaker and linguistic features, requiring unsegmented inputs during training and incurring high computational costs.

To overcome these limitations, we employ a TdSV system that utilizes two pre-trained models independently and demonstrate that, by leveraging pre-trained models with targeted domain adaptation, competitive results can be achieved while avoiding the substantial computational costs associated with joint fine-tuning on unsegmented inputs in conventional approaches. Our best system reached a MinDCF of 0.0358 on the evaluation subset and secured first place in the challenge.</p>

            <h2>TuneS: Patient-specific model-based optimization of contact configuration in deep brain stimulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Franziska Frigge, Lina Uggla, Elena Jiltsova, Markus Fahlström, Dag Nyholm, Alexander Medvedev</p>
            <p>Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings show that both the STN motor subdivision and STN motor streamlines are consistently engaged under clinical settings, while regions of avoidance receive minimal stimulation. Given these findings, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing anatomical constraints is demonstrated at the example of ten Parkinson's disease patients. The predicted settings were generally found to achieve higher target coverages while providing a better trade-off between maximizing target coverage and minimizing stimulation of regions associated with side effects. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</p>

            <p>The next generations of wireless networks are envisioned to integrate communications, sensing, and computing into a unified platform, demanding ultra-high data rates, submillisecond latency, and unprecedented energy efficiency. However, conventional digital processors face limitations in scalability, cost, and power consumption that hinder this vision. Wave computing, enabled by programmable metasurfaces, offers an alternative paradigm according to which signal processing operations are implemented in the domain of the propagation of electromagnetic waves. This approach transforms metasurfaces from passive wavefront shapers into functional analog processors capable of executing tasks such as beamforming, sensing, imaging, and machine learning at the speed of light with minimal power consumption. This article provides an overview of metasurface-enabled wave computing, highlighting its fundamental principles and key application scenarios for future wireless systems, including integrated sensing and communications, artificial intelligence acceleration, over-the-air channel estimation, and computational electromagnetic imaging. Future research directions are outlined in response to the major open challenges of the technology, aiming to enable large-scale deployment of wave computing in practical wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang, Qingqing Wu, Chao Ren</p>
            <p>This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</p>

            <h2>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee</p>
            <p>Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. This adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.</p>

            <p>We introduce ultrasound phase microscopy (UPM), a label-free imaging technique that breaks the diffraction limit using the intrinsic backscatter of red blood cells. By exploiting phase differences between consecutive frames beamformed with mismatched apodizations, UPM extracts sub-wavelength flow information without contrast enhancement. Comprehensive in vivo validation across three species (mouse, rat, rabbit) and three organ systems (brain, spinal cord, kidney) demonstrated spatial resolutions superior to 5 micrometers a tenfold improvement over conventional color flow imaging. Furthermore, UPM accelerates acquisition by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to localization microscopy. These results establish UPM as a robust, translatable approach for routine super-resolution microvascular screening in clinical diagnostics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meiyan Kang, Shizuo Kaji, Sang-Yun Lee, Taegon Kim, Hee-Hwan Ryu, Suyoung Choi</p>
            <p>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</p>

            <h2>Generative Diffusion Receivers: Achieving Pilot-Efficient MIMO-OFDM Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhi Yang, Omar Alhussein, Atefeh Arani, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference, achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems, generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models, we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.</p>

            <h2>Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruolin Du, Zhiqiang Wei, Zai Yang, Lei Yang, Yong Zeng, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Guanding Yu, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
            <p>In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios.</p>

            <p>Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30% reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Cao, Zishuo Feng, Jicong Zhang, Wei Shi</p>
            <p>Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wen, Xiaoming Chen, Maojun Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.</p>

            <p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access, high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage. However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing, hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations, inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC jointly exploits communication, localization, and sensing functionalities, achieving synergistic gains in throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness through shared resources and cooperative design. We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna reconfigurability, and inter-satellite link design. The article concludes by outlining open research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future non-terrestrial networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Hong, Umberto Villa, Jeffrey A. Fessler</p>
            <p>Model-based reconstruction plays a key role in compressed sensing (CS) MRI, as it incorporates effective image regularizers to improve the quality of reconstruction. The Plug-and-Play and Regularization-by-Denoising frameworks leverage advanced denoisers (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers) and have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, their theoretical guarantees remain limited, as practical CNNs often violate key assumptions. In contrast, gradient-driven denoisers achieve competitive performance, and the required assumptions for theoretical analysis are easily satisfied. However, solving the associated optimization problem remains computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized Krylov subspace method (GKSM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Moreover, we also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for GKSM in nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with spiral and radial acquisitions validate both the computational efficiency of GKSM and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. The proposed optimization method is applicable to any linear inverse problem.</p>

            <p>High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Rosseel, Toon van Waterschoot</p>
            <p>Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic environments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible, acoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis requires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters that model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in concert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time, resulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the convolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant latency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In this paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based auralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the acoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A comparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated convolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time performance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system integrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU, creating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes processing latency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, Y. Thomas Hou</p>
            <p>Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Estimation with Limited Data Rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieming Ke, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information. Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples demonstrate the main results.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</p>

As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted.

In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result this http URL.</p>

            <h2>Fast Collaborative Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ce Zheng, Ke Zhang, Chen Sun, Wenqi Zhang, Qiong Liu, Angesom Ataklity Tesfay</p>
            <p>Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a small draft model to predict multiple future tokens for verification by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this enables device-edge collaborative inference but introduces significant uplink overhead, as existing distributed speculative decoding schemes transmit full vocabulary logits at every step. We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability. Experiments show that TSLT significantly reduces uplink communication while maintaining end-to-end inference latency and model quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable, communication-efficient distributed LLM inference in future AI-RAN systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsin Iqbal Khan, Matti Hämäläinen, Timo J. Mäkelä, Erkki Harjula, Jani Katisko</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.</p>

            <h2>Speak the Art: A Direct Speech to Image Generation Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Saeed, Manar Amr, Farida Adel, Nada Hassan, Nour Walid, Eman Mohamed, Mohamed Hussein, Marwan Torki</p>
            <p>Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Path Loss: Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Modeling for UAV Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf, İsmail Güvenç</p>
            <p>This paper presents a measurement-based framework for characterizing altitude-dependent spectral behavior of signals received by a tethered Helikite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongyang Lv, Yanmei Jia, Yongqing Liu, Alan F. Lynch, Qing Zhao, Yuhu Wu</p>
            <p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. An inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Study on the Effectiveness of ASR Representations for Noise-Robust Speech Emotion Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohan Shi, Jiajun He, Xingfeng Li, Tomoki Toda</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an efficient attempt to noisy speech emotion recognition (NSER). Conventional NSER approaches have proven effective in mitigating the impact of artificial noise sources, such as white Gaussian noise, but are limited to non-stationary noises in real-world environments due to their complexity and uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new method for NSER by adopting the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as a noise-robust feature extractor to eliminate non-vocal information in noisy speech. We first obtain intermediate layer information from the ASR model as a feature representation for emotional speech and then apply this representation for the downstream NSER task. Our experimental results show that 1) the proposed method achieves better NSER performance compared with the conventional noise reduction method, 2) outperforms self-supervised learning approaches, and 3) even outperforms text-based approaches using ASR transcription or the ground truth transcription of noisy speech.</p>

We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain.

We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</p>

            <p>In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains >90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</p>

            <p>How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Analysis of Simultaneous Double Q-learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunjun Na, Donghwan Lee</p>
            <p>$Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite its widespread success in various applications, it is prone to overestimation bias in the $Q$-learning update. To address this issue, double $Q$-learning employs two independent $Q$-estimators which are randomly selected and updated during the learning process. This paper proposes a modified double $Q$-learning, called simultaneous double $Q$-learning (SDQ), with its finite-time analysis. SDQ eliminates the need for random selection between the two $Q$-estimators, and this modification allows us to analyze double $Q$-learning through the lens of a novel switching system framework facilitating efficient finite-time analysis. Empirical studies demonstrate that SDQ converges faster than double $Q$-learning while retaining the ability to mitigate the maximization bias. Finally, we derive a finite-time expected error bound for SDQ.</p>

            <p>Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) represent data features by learning the activation functions and demonstrate superior accuracy with fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory usage (Memory), shorter training time (TraT), and testing time (TesT) when handling low-dimensional data. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, which contains significant redundant information, the current activation mechanism of KANs leads to unnecessary computations, thereby reducing computational efficiency. KANs require reshaping high-dimensional data into a one-dimensional tensor as input, which inevitably results in the loss of dimensional information. To address these limitations, we propose weighted activation distribution KANs (WKANs), which reduce the frequency of activations per node and distribute node information into different output nodes through weights to avoid extracting redundant information. Furthermore, we introduce a multilevel tensor splitting framework (MTSF), which decomposes high-dimensional data to extract features from each dimension independently and leverages tensor-parallel computation to significantly improve the computational efficiency of WKANs on high-dimensional data. In this paper, we design SpectralKAN for hyperspectral image change detection using the proposed MTSF. SpectralKAN demonstrates outstanding performance across five datasets, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.9801 and a Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.9514 on the Farmland dataset, with only 8 k parameters, 0.07 M FLOPs, 911 MB Memory, 13.26 S TraT, and 2.52 S TesT, underscoring its superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

            <h2>TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nian Wu, Jiarui Xing, Miaomiao Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Falih Gozi Febrinanto, Kristen Moore, Chandra Thapa, Jiangang Ma, Vidya Saikrishna</p>
            <p>Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Intelligence lies not only in the brain (decision-making processes) but in the body (physical morphology). The morphology of robots can significantly influence how they interact with the physical world, crucial for manipulating objects in real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulty in establishing stable forces or geometric constraints. Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By adjusting surfaces' position and orientation, objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasping, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels and can even manipulate the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.</p>

            <h2>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov</p>
            <p>Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengrui Quan, Brian Wang, Kang Yang, Liying Han, Mani Srivastava</p>
            <p>Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.</p>

This approach leverages synthetic EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and speech recordings.</p>

            <p>3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill dataset gaps, we propose a Realistic Anomaly Augmentation that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. Then, a novel framework that integrates OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, OccOoD, is proposed, which uses Cross-Space Semantic Refinement (CSSR) to refine semantic predictions from complementary voxel and BEV representations, improving OoD detection. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 65.50% and an AuPRCr of 31.83 within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive semantic occupancy prediction performance and generalization in real-world urban driving scenes.

            <h2>TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehan Li, Hongjie Chen, Qing Wang, Yuxin Zhang, Jing Zhou, Hang Lv, Mengjie Du, Yaodong Song, Jie Lian, Jian Kang, Jie Li, Yongxiang Li, Xuelong Li</p>
            <p>Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.</p>

            <p>Scene recognition is important for hearing devices, however; this is challenging, in part because of the limitations of existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine learning models. Deploying such models on resource-constrained edge devices presents another this http URL proposed solution is two-fold, a repack and refinement of several open source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for auditory scene recognition for hearing devices, and introduce OpenYAMNet, a sound recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model comparison. OpenYAMNet is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality, serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. OpenYAMNet achieved a mean average precision of 0.86 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories relevant to auditory scene recognition. Real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities were demonstrated on edge devices by deploying OpenYAMNet to an Android smartphone. Even with a 2018 Google Pixel 3, a phone with modest specifications, the model processes audio with approximately 50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms per 1 second of audio.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Giacchi</p>
            <p>Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce Neighborhood Feature Pooling (NFP), a novel pooling layer designed to enhance texture-aware representation learning for remote sensing image classification. The proposed NFP layer captures relationships between neighboring spatial features by aggregating local similarity patterns across feature dimensions. Implemented using standard convolutional operations, NFP can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural network architectures with minimal additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and backbone models demonstrate that NFP consistently improves classification performance compared to conventional pooling strategies, while maintaining computational efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of neighborhood-based feature aggregation for capturing discriminative texture information in remote sensing imagery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryoma Yataka, Pu Perry Wang, Petros Boufounos, Ryuhei Takahashi</p>
            <p>Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

            <p>Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

            <h2>PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huizheng Wang, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin</p>
            <p>Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency. This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria. We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuang Shi, Géraldine Morin, Simone Gasparini, Wei Tsang Ooi</p>
            <p>We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail. In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</p>

            <h2>How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Nyangon, Brecht Seifi</p>
            <p>The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.</p>

            <h2>LLM-DMD: Large Language Model-based Power System Dynamic Model Discovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Ke Zuo, Wenqi Huang, Mingyang Sun</p>
            <p>Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.</p>

            <p>Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerald Ogbonna, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.</p>

            <p>A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.</p>

            <p>The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.</p>

            <h2>Definition and Formulation of Inertia Service Incorporating Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojin Park, Ross Baldick, Hunyoung Shin</p>
            <p>Increasing concerns over the scarcity of inertia have motivated the procurement of inertia as an ancillary service (AS). Despite numerous academic and practical efforts, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and treatment of inertia service in market operations, particularly the specification of inertia variables and the separation between synchronous inertia (SI) from synchronous generators and virtual inertia (VI) from inverter-based resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a power-oriented (P-oriented) definition based on inertial response, which establishes conceptual consistency between SI and VI and makes the inertia service commensurable with other ASs. This definition explicitly incorporates both positive and negative inertial responses during frequency drop events. We then formulate a security-constrained economic dispatch framework based on this P-oriented definition and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through simulations. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed bidirectional service definition ensures price signals that reflect the economic value of inertial provision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitraya Avadhut Desai, Ognjen Stanojev, Simon Muntwiler, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Small-signal stability of modern converter-dominated power systems has been the subject of extensive research, particularly from the perspective of device-level control design for grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) converters. However, the influence of power flow variables on system stability has received limited attention. Conventional small-signal stability analyses are typically conducted at a specific operating point, emphasizing the selection of control or system design parameters while neglecting the sensitivity of stability characteristics to operating conditions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by systematically investigating the impact of dispatch decisions on the small-signal stability of converter-based power systems. Our findings are first illustrated on a three-bus system and then validated on the standard IEEE 39-bus test system to demonstrate scalability. Across the test systems, we find that high-voltage capacitive operation of GFL converters limits its active power injection, whereas inductive operation permits higher injections, and it is generally preferable for the GFM converter to supply more active power.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based framework for detecting cyberattacks on transformer current differential relays (TCDRs), which, if undetected, may trigger false tripping of critical transformers. The proposed approach adapts and fine-tunes compact LLMs such as DistilBERT to distinguish cyberattacks from actual faults using textualized multidimensional TCDR current measurements recorded before and after tripping. Our results demonstrate that DistilBERT detects 97.6% of cyberattacks without compromising TCDR dependability and achieves inference latency below 6 ms on a commercial workstation. Additional evaluations confirm the framework's robustness under combined time-synchronization and false-data-injection attacks, resilience to measurement noise, and stability across prompt formulation variants. Furthermore, GPT-2 and DistilBERT+LoRA achieve comparable performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity.

            <p>Without requiring operational costs such as cabling and powering while maintaining reconfigurable phase-shift capability, self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ssRISs) can be deployed in locations inaccessible to conventional relays or base stations, offering a novel approach to enhance wireless coverage. This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.</p>

            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianan Bai, Anubhab Chowdhury, Anders Hansson, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.</p>

            <h2>Battery-time-space fragment-based formulation for the Electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boshuai Zhao, Adam Abdin, Jakob Puchinger</p>
            <p>The Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP) optimizes routing and scheduling for electric autonomous vehicles to transport customers from origins to destinations. It features a combined objective that minimizes travel cost and excess user ride time, and allows partial recharging. Motivated by practical scenarios where time and battery data are available with limited precision, we introduce a discrete variant of the problem, termed D-E-ADARP, in which all time and battery parameters are discretized. This enables the development of our alternative solution approach: the discrete battery-time-space fragment-based formulation (BTSFF). In this framework, a fragment represents a subpath with an associated cost that accounts for both travel cost and excess user ride time. The BTSFF network integrates spatial, temporal, and battery dimensions, with the latter two discretized into finite indices. Computational results show that BTSFF solves D-E-ADARP significantly more efficiently than existing methods applied to the original E-ADARP. In addition, BTSFF efficiently provides high-quality lower bounds for E-ADARP and accelerates solving its battery swap variants. For E-ADARP, a relaxed network is constructed by rounding down travel times and battery consumptions, enabling a valid lower bound. For battery swap variants, BTSFF integrates lazy constraints via callbacks to correct time discretization errors, guaranteeing optimal solutions. Experiments show BTSFF outperforms benchmark methods in efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Energy Harvesting in High Altitude Platform Station Enabled Sensor Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melek Tuylu, Eylem Erdogan</p>
            <p>High altitude platform station (HAPS) systems are becoming crucial facilitators for future wireless communication networks, enhancing connectivity across all vertical communication layers, including small Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices, terrestrial users, and aerial devices. In the context of the widely recognized vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture, HAPS systems can provide service to both aerial and ground users. However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Moreover, we explore the system in terms of throughput. The findings reveal that harnessing full potential of EH stands as a viable approach to meet the energy demands of HAPS systems.</p>

            <h2>Online Decision-Making Under Uncertainty for Vehicle-to-Building Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishav Sen, Yunuo Zhang, Fangqi Liu, Jose Paolo Talusan, Ava Pettet, Yoshinori Suzue, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey</p>
            <p>Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <h2>Cyberattack Detection in Virtualized Microgrids Using LightGBM and Knowledge-Distilled Classifiers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Osasumwen Cedric Ogiesoba-Eguakun, Suman Rath</p>
            <p>Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</p>

            <h2>DSP-Based Sub-Switching-Period Current-Limiting Control for Grid-Tied Inverter under Grid Faults</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeyeon Park, Jiyu Lee, Junyeol Maeng, Shenghui Cui</p>
            <p>This paper presents a sub-switching period current-limiting control for a grid-tied inverter to prevent transient overcurrents during grid faults and enable seamless fault ride-through (FRT). Sudden grid-voltage disturbances, such as voltage sags or phase jumps, can induce large transient currents within a switching period, particularly at low switching frequencies. Upon disturbance detection, the proposed method immediately modifies the pulse-width modulation carrier, enabling continuous regulation of the inverter output current within a time much shorter than a switching period without interrupting current flow. The proposed method can be implemented on commonly used digital signal processors without requiring specialized analog or digital circuits or high-speed computing devices. Experimental results from a 2-level, 3-phase inverter switching at 3.6 kHz validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under symmetric and asymmetric voltage sags and phase jumps.</p>

            <h2>Accounting for Optimal Control in the Sizing of Isolated Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems Using Imitation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Halvdansson, Lucas Ferreira Bernardino, Brage Rugstad Knudsen</p>
            <p>Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.</p>

            <h2>Multi-agent Optimization of Non-cooperative Multimodal Mobility Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Nafees Fuad Rafi, Zhaomiao Guo</p>
            <p>While multimodal mobility systems have the potential to bring many benefits to travelers, drivers, the environment, and traffic congestion, such systems typically involve multiple non-cooperative decision-makers who may selfishly optimize their own objectives without considering the overall system benefits. This paper aims to investigate market-based interactions of travelers and ride-sourcing drivers in the context of multimodal mobility systems. We propose a unified mathematical modeling framework to capture the decentralized travelers and drivers' decision-making process and balance the network's demand and supply by equilibrium pricing. Such a model allows analyses of the impact of decentralized decision-making on multimodal mobility efficiencies. The proposed formulation can be further convexified to efficiently compute the equilibrium ride-sourcing prices. We conduct numerical experiments on different settings of transportation networks to gain policy insights. We find that travelers prefer ride-sourcing and multimodal transportation more than the driving option when they are more sensitive to prices. We also find that travelers may need to be subsidized to use multimodal transportation when there is fewer transit hubs in the network or, ride-sourcing drivers become too sensitive to the prices. However, we find that more transit hubs in the network increases the total empty VMT of ride-sourcing drivers by increasing the total relocation time. The proposed model can be used by policymakers and platform operators to design pricing and subsidy schemes that align individual decision-making with system-level efficiency and evaluate the trade-offs between accessibility and environmental impacts in multimodal transportation networks.</p>

            <h2>Flexible-Duplex Cell-Free Architecture for Secure Uplink Communications in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Shi, Wei Xu, Yongming Huang, Jiacheng Yao, Wenhao Hu, Dongming Wang</p>
            <p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.</p>

            <h2>Economic zone data-enabled predictive control for connected open water systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoqiao Chen, Xuewen Zhang, Minghao Han, Adrian Wing-Keung Law, Xunyuan Yin</p>
            <p>The real-time operation of open water systems is essential for ensuring operational safety, satisfying operational requirements, and optimizing energy usage. However, existing rule-based control strategies rely heavily on human experience, while model-based approaches depend on accurate hydrodynamic models, which limit their applicability to water systems with complex dynamics and uncertain disturbances. In this work, we develop a fully data-driven, zone-based control framework with adaptive control target zone selection for safe and energy-efficient operation of connected open water systems. Specifically, we propose a mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach that aims to maintain the water levels of the branches within the desired water-level zone while reducing real-time operational energy consumption. The DeePC-based approach enables direct use of input-output data for predictive control, eliminating the need for explicit dynamic modeling. To handle multiple control objectives with different priorities, we employ lexicographic optimization and reformulate the traditional DeePC cost function to incorporate zone tracking and energy consumption minimization objectives. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is utilized to determine the control target zone, which enables an effective trade-off between zone tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water levels within the desired water-level zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 hour. Compared to rule-based control method, the proposed method lowers zone-violation frequency by 74.96% and the average energy consumption by 22.44%.</p>

            <h2>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong</p>
            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</p>

            <h2>Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer for Predicting Smart Grid Failures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh Le, Phat K. Huynh, Om P. Yadav, Harun Pirim, Chau Le, Trung Q. Le</p>
            <p>Smart grid infrastructure needs improved resilience and preventive maintenance through more accurate predictions. Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework. The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingxuan Li, Wei Wei, Yin Xu, Chengeng Zhang, Shanshan Shi</p>
            <p>Extreme events such as earthquakes pose significant threats to integrated electricity-gas distribution systems (IEGDS) by causing widespread damage. Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an outage cost comparable to the ideal solution, and reduces the total outage cost by more than 15% compared to strategies based on stochastic programming and heuristic methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingbo Qu, Yijie Wang, Yujie Fu, Putai Zhang, Weihan Li, Mian Li</p>
            <p>Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are increasingly critical to power-system stability, yet their operation and maintenance remain dominated by reactive, expert-dependent diagnostics. While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems.</p>

            <p>Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueyun Long, Yueheng Li, Mario Pauli, Benjamin Nuss, Thomas Zwick</p>
            <p>Base station (BS) deployment remains a critical task with successive wireless communication generations and increasing data rates demands, while the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is often underrated, yielding potential health implications. Therefore, this paper proposes a workflow that adjusts BS deployment and radiated power in a 3D urban scenario to jointly consider EMF exposure and coverage. To achieve this ambition, firstly, a novel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) tool is developed to improve computational efficiency, and simultaneously enhance diffraction modeling} for accurate EMF exposure calculation, validated with real-world measurements. To efficiently extend the computation across the target urban area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed based on the spatial stability of the effective channel while accounting for BS beamforming, enabling global estimation of EMF exposure and signal coverage. Subsequently, to better represent real-world communication network behaviors, the actual maximum transmit power, intercell interference, and channel state information imperfection are incorporated on the BS side, while mobility over the EMF exposure averaging interval is captured on the user equipment side. Upon the aforementioned aspects, the coverage-guaranteed EMF exposure minimization problem is formulated in a realistic and accurate manner, and solved by a geometry-aware algorithm adapted to deterministic channel models, yielding the optimal BS deployment and power configuration. In comparison to a baseline that relies on an empirical channel model, the proposed workflow delivers more reliable estimation of EMF exposure and provides practical guidance for BS construction and operations.</p>

            <p>This study examines long-term CO$_2$ emission trajectories across five major economies: Nigeria, the United States, China, Brazil, and Russia, by integrating national energy-mix characteristics with time-series forecasting models. Annual emissions from 2000-2023 were analyzed alongside energy production data to classify countries into fossil-dependent, transition-phase, or renewable-accelerated profiles. Three forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R$^2$ metrics. Results show that Holt-Winters provided the most accurate forecasts for Nigeria, the United States, China, and Brazil, while SARIMA performed best for Russia due to its relatively stable emissions. Long-term projections from 2024 to 2060 indicate divergent decarbonization pathways. Brazil aligns most closely with a low-emission future owing to its renewable-dominant energy system, whereas Nigeria continues on an upward emissions trajectory driven by fossil dependence. The United States and China maintain moderate declines but require accelerated mitigation to reach their respective net-zero commitments. Russia's emissions remain largely flat under current conditions. These findings highlight the strong influence of energy structures on national decarbonization prospects and underscore the need for targeted energy policy reforms to align with global climate objectives.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a hybrid hydrogen electrolyzer-supercapacitor system (HESS) with a novel control strategy for renewable-dominant power grids. The HESS consists of alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL), and supercapacitors (SC). The interfacing inverters between HESS and power grid are regulated by an inertia emulation control strategy. From HESS, AEL is with conventional DC power control, whereas PEMEL and SC are designed with the proposed dynamic inertia control and capacitive inertia control, respectively. Benefitting from the coordination of three controls, within the HESS, high-frequency transient power components are autonomously handled by SC, stable frequency power components are regulated by PEMEL, and low-frequency steady-state power is addressed by AEL, characterized by low operational gains and longer lifetimes. SC delivers transient power, significantly alleviating energy losses on electrolyzers and achieving adequate inertia recovery capabilities while requiring no additional communication. Implementing SOC recovery control enables the SC to withstand more than three times more stability discharge cycles compared to an SC without SOC recovery. Furthermore, a large-signal mathematical model based on mixed potential theory is established, providing clear stability boundaries for system parameters. Dynamic analyses theoretically verify system feasibility, and extensive hardware-in-the-loop experimental results fully validate the proposed HESS along with the corresponding transient power allocation controls.</p>

            <p>An operational optimization strategy for microgrid energy storage systems (ESSs) is developed to address practical user-oriented application requirements, and its effectiveness is validated using real-world operational data. First, a fundamental ESS model is established to characterize system dynamics and operational constraints, providing a theoretical basis for optimization. Subsequently, a multi-objective operational optimization framework is formulated to simultaneously minimize electricity cost, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance renewable energy utilization. To ensure computational efficiency and scalability, the commercial optimization solver Gurobi is employed. The proposed strategy is evaluated using actual microgrid operational data, demonstrating that the developed ESS model accurately represents real system constraints. Compared with existing user operational strategies, the proposed approach achieves an average reduction of 13.47% in electricity cost. Moreover, by dynamically adjusting the weighting factors of the multi-objective formulation, the strategy enables flexible operational modes and significantly improves adaptability to varying operating scenarios. In addition, the proposed framework provides decision support for user-side microgrids participating in surplus electricity feed-in policies. The main contribution of this work lies in its user-centric optimization design, which enhances operational flexibility and scenario adaptability through multi-objective weight allocation, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world microgrid ESS operation.</p>

            <h2>A Survey on Applications of Quantum Computing for Unit Commitment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Ali Rajabi, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods. Key modeling strategies, hardware implementations, and computational trade-offs are discussed, highlighting the current progress, limitations, and potential future directions for large-scale quantum-enabled UC.</p>

            <h2>A Multi-Scale Attention-Based Attack Diagnosis Mechanism for Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks in Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
            <p>Parallel cyber--physical attacks (PCPA) can simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and disrupt measurement data transmission in power grids, severely impairing system situational awareness and attack diagnosis. This paper investigates the attack diagnosis problem for linearized AC/DC power flow models under PCPA, where physical attacks include not only line disconnections but also admittance modifications, such as those caused by compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-assisted attack diagnosis framework based on meta--mixed-integer programming (MMIP), which integrates a convolutional graph cross-attention attack localization (CGCA-AL) model. First, sufficient conditions for measurement reconstruction are derived, enabling the recovery of unknown measurements in attacked areas using available measurements and network topology information. Based on these conditions, the attack diagnosis problem is formulated as an MMIP model. The proposed CGCA-AL employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to predict a probability distribution over potential physical attack locations, which is incorporated into the MMIP as informative objective coefficients. By solving the resulting MMIP, both the locations and magnitudes of physical attacks are optimally estimated, and system states are subsequently reconstructed. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed attack diagnosis framework under complex PCPA scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Alimohammadi, Samara Mayhoub, Sotiris Chatzimiltis, Mohammad Shojafar, Muhammad Nasir Mumtaz Bhutta</p>
            <p>Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</p>

            <h2>Impact Assessment of Heterogeneous Grid Support Functions in Smart Inverter Deployments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Gokul Krishnan, Mohd. Asim Aftab, Nabil Mohammed, Shehab Ahmed, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The decarbonization of the energy sector has led to a significant high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Kuku Fotock, Alessio Zappone, Agbotiname Lucky Imoize, Marco Di Renzo</p>
            <p>This study considers a point-to-point wireless link, in which both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains.</p>

            <p>Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled dual-scale channel estimation framework, where large-scale channel estimation benefits from sensing, and the temporal variation of small-scale channel state information is modeled via channel aging. By characterizing the impact of angular sensing error on the communication spatial correlation matrix, we derive a closed form expression for the achievable rate under dual-scale channel estimation errors. Considering the different characteristics in time scales, we design the sensing duration for slow-varying large-scale channel and determine the update timing and frequency for fast-varying small-scale channel information within a given frame structure. We formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem under limited time resources and sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints, and propose a segmented golden based joint optimization algorithm to efficiently solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes, which further validate that the system can leverage additional sensing capabilities to enhance communication efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sel Ly, Rufan Yang, Ninad Dixit, Hung Dinh Nguyen</p>
            <p>Lithium-ion batteries are the major type of battery used in a variety of everyday applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), mobile devices, and energy storage systems. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Voltage and Current Control Method for Harmonic Mitigation of Single-Phase AC Loads in DC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Baharizadeh, Mohammad Sadegh Golsorkhi, Neda Keshavarzi, Thomas Ebel</p>
            <p>DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.</p>

            <h2>A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Zijun Chen, Haiwang Zhong, Di Cao, Guangchun Ruan</p>
            <p>In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</p>

For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm.

The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya, Sajad Khodadadian, Taylan G. Topcu</p>
            <p>As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</p>

Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

            <h2>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal</p>
            <p>Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya, Sajad Khodadadian, Taylan G. Topcu</p>
            <p>As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</p>

            <h2>Validation methodology on real data of reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Svyatoslav Covanov, Cedric Pradalier</p>
            <p>This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach.</p>

HOMER pro 3.11.2 was used to design and evaluate a novel, integrated optimization and comparative assessment of diverse HRES, specif ically adjusted to the energy consumptions and available resources of the Hospital. The scenario evaluation showed that interconnecting photovoltaic (PV), biomass generator (BG), wind power (WP), diesel generator (DG), battery, and converter can effectively provide the Hospital's daily energy consumption of 11,214.66 kWh while conforming reliability and reducing emissions. The PV/BG/batt/conv configuration emerged as the most cost-effective and sustainable alternative, attaining the lowest LCOE of \$0.339/kWh, an NPC of \$25.7 million, and a 100% renewable energy fraction with simple pay back of 7.26 yr. As a result, the operational cost associated with the consumption of 500.00 L of diesel per month can be entirely avoided. The DG-integrated hybrids exhibit advanced techno-economic capability with significant worth, strong ROI (20\%) and IRR (18\%), endorsed by fast capital recovery (7.21-8.71 years). Overall, the hybrid system offers an optimal balance of cost, reliability, and sustainability, making it a promising and scalable solution for electrification of energy scare institution and areas in Ethiopia, thereby contributing to national sustainable energy development goals.</p>

            <h2>A Learning-Driven Stochastic Hybrid System Framework for Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari</p>
            <p>This paper presents a new learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) framework designed for the detection and classification of contingencies in modern power systems. Unlike conventional monitoring schemes, the proposed approach is capable of identifying unobservable events that remain hidden from standard sensing infrastructures, such as undetected protection system malfunctions. The framework operates by analyzing deviations in system outputs and behaviors, which are then categorized into three groups: physical, control, and measurement contingencies based on their impact on the SHS model. The SHS model integrates both system dynamics and observer-driven state estimation error dynamics. Within this architecture, machine learning classifiers are employed to achieve rapid and accurate categorization of contingencies. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus systems, where results indicate substantial improvements in both detection speed and accuracy compared with existing approaches.</p>

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error.

            <p>This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then synthesize speech based on the translated units and source speaker's identity using a conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace, while achieving competitive translation performance.

            <h2>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Schildbach</p>
            <p>Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Alberto Bemporad</p>
            <p>Dynamical models identified from data are frequently employed in control system design. However, decoupling system identification from controller synthesis can result in situations where no suitable controller exists after a model has been identified. In this work, we introduce a novel control-oriented regularization in the identification procedure to ensure the existence of a controller that can enforce constraints on system variables robustly. The combined identification algorithm includes: (i) the concurrent learning of an uncertain model and a nominal model using an observer; (ii) a regularization term on the model parameters defined as the size of the largest robust control invariant set for the uncertain model. To make the learning problem tractable, we consider nonlinear models in quasi Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) form, utilizing a novel scheduling function parameterization that facilitates the derivation of an associated uncertain linear model. The robust control invariant set is represented as a polytope, and we adopt novel results from polytope geometry to derive the regularization function as the optimal value of a convex quadratic program. Additionally, we present new model-reduction approaches that exploit the chosen model structure. Numerical examples on classical identification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A simple control scheme is also derived to provide an example of data-driven control of a constrained nonlinear system.</p>

            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but suffered from prolonged acquisition time. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to accelerate acquisition and demonstrate promising performance, they rely on high-quality fully-sampled datasets for training in a supervised manner. However, such datasets are time-consuming and expensive-to-collect, which constrains their broader applications. On the other hand, self-supervised methods offer an alternative by enabling learning from under-sampled data alone, but most existing methods rely on further partitioned under-sampled k-space data as model's input for training, resulting in a loss of valuable information. Additionally, their models have not fully incorporated image priors, leading to degraded reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel re-visible dual-domain self-supervised deep unfolding network to address these issues when only under-sampled datasets are available. Specifically, by incorporating re-visible dual-domain loss, all under-sampled k-space data are utilized during training to mitigate information loss caused by further partitioning. This design enables the model to implicitly adapt to all under-sampled k-space data as input. Additionally, we design a deep unfolding network based on Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (DUN-CP-PPA) to achieve end-to-end reconstruction, incorporating imaging physics and image priors to guide the reconstruction process. By employing a Spatial-Frequency Feature Extraction (SFFE) block to capture global and local feature representation, we enhance the model's efficiency to learn comprehensive image priors. Experiments conducted on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction performance.</p>

            <h2>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Schildbach</p>
            <p>Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p>

            <h2>EcoNet: Multiagent Planning and Control Of Household Energy Resources Using Active Inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John C. Boik, Kobus Esterhuysen, Jacqueline B. Hynes, Axel Constant, Ines Hipolito, Mahault Albarracin, Alex B. Kiefer, Karl Friston</p>
            <p>Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences. Simulation results are presented and discussed.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Day Scheduling for Electric Vehicle Routing: A Novel Model and Comparison Of Metaheuristics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Köster, Florian Porkert, Klaus Volbert</p>
            <p>The increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) requires efficient route planning solutions that take into account the limited range of EVs and the associated charging times, as well as the different types of charging stations. In this work, we model and solve an electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) designed for a cross-platform navigation system for individual transport. The aim is to provide users with an efficient route for their daily appointments and to reduce possible inconveniences caused by charging their EV. Based on these assumptions, we propose a multi-day model in the form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that takes into account the vehicle's battery capacity and the time windows of user's appointments. The model is solved using various established metaheuristics, including tabu search (TS), adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), and ant colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the performance of the individual approaches is analyzed using generated ensembles to estimate their behavior in reality and is compared with the exact results of the Google OR-Tools solver.</p>

            <h2>An Equivalent and Unified Virtual Battery Modeling Framework for Flexibility Characterization of Building HVAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhu, Yu Yang, Liang Yu, Qing-Shan Jia, Costas J. Spanos, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system dominates building's energy consumption and meanwhile exhibits substantial operational flexibility that can be exploited for providing grid services. However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost.</p>

            <h2>Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khaled Bin Walid, Feng Ye, Jiaxiang Ji, Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, Travis Miles, Yazhou Leo Jiang</p>
            <p>This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Placement of Data Centers to Support Power Distribution Networks Using Intelligent Algorithms with Economic Indicators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Hajihasani, Mahmoud Modaresi</p>
            <p>Data centers are among the fastest growing electricity consumers and can impose severe voltage drops and feeder losses when connected to weak distribution networks. This paper formulates a techno economic siting problem in which each candidate data center site is mapped to a bus of the distribution network and is assumed to deploy on site renewable generation and power electronic interfaces, resulting in a controllable net active power injection equivalent to distributed generation. A mixed integer nonlinear optimization model is developed to jointly select the connection bus and size the DG capacity while respecting network operating limits. The objective combines three normalized terms including active power losses, a voltage deviation index capturing profile quality, and investment cost derived from location dependent land price and unit DG cost. To address the discrete continuous search space, an intelligent genetic algorithm is embedded in a multi scenario decision framework with adaptive weight tuning. Three stakeholder scenarios prioritize losses, voltage quality, or techno economic balance, and additional balanced scenarios are generated automatically until the optimal bus decision converges. A case study on the IEEE 33 bus radial system demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The converged design selects bus 14 with 1.10 MW DG, reducing total losses from 202.67 kW to 129.37 kW while improving the minimum bus voltage to 0.933 per unit at a moderate investment cost of 1.33 MUSD. The proposed framework provides an interpretable pathway to integrate economic indicators into distribution aware data center siting.</p>

            <p>This article presents a study on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems using low-cost pyranometer sensors.

The strategy was implemented in the local control of a Cuk converter and experimentally validated against the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based technique, leveraging affordable sensor technology, achieves accurate MPPT performance with reduced fluctuations, enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of PV tracking systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hritik Gopal Shah, Catherine Tajmajer, Elli Ntakou</p>
            <p>Natural disasters often inflict severe damage on distribution grids. Rapid, reliable damage assessment (DA) is essential for storm restoration, yet most optimization work targets repair dispatch after faults are identified. This paper presents a production, rolling horizon DA crew allocation system deployed across multiple U.S. states in Eversource Energy's service territory and used during live storms. The method implements a sequential k-job assignment policy per available crew, executed on a fixed cadence and on operators' control. The objective jointly prioritizes critical facilities and customer impact while controlling travel time on the actual road network via the Google Maps API. A key constraint is the absence of live crew GPS; we infer crew locations from the last confirmed DA site and robustify travel estimates for staleness, yielding stable recommendations without continuous tracking. The operator remains in the loop with controls to limit churn and to publish a feasible plan. Using data from the March 7 New Hampshire storm with 90 moderate outages and seven DA crews, we observe shorter time to first assessment, fewer revisits with reduced distance traveled. To our knowledge, this is among the first multi-state enterprise integrated deployments to treat DA crews as a first-class optimized resource in storm restoration.</p>

            <p>The growing complexity of power system operations has created an urgent need for intelligent, automated tools to support reliable and efficient grid management. Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language queries. The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Honghui Zheng, Pietro Favaro, Yury Dvorkin, Ján Drgoňa</p>
            <p>Underground pumped hydro energy storage (UPHES) systems play a critical role in grid-scale energy storage for renewable integration, yet optimal day-ahead scheduling remains computationally prohibitive due to nonlinear turbine performance characteristics and discrete operational modes. This paper presents a decision-focused learning (DFL) framework that addresses the computational-accuracy trade-off in UPHES day-ahead scheduling. The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark. Thus, the presented DFL framework enables flexible prioritization between profit maximization and real-time responsiveness.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Sadi</p>
            <p>As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongkyu Jung, Namyoon Lee, Jeonghun Park</p>
            <p>This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for uplink pinching antenna system (PASS). Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Zhuang, Ximing Xie, Fang Fang, Ali Attaran, Zhizhong Zhang</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface.</p>

While opportunities and potential performance have been largely investigated in simulations, few experimental works have showcased Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) effectiveness in a real-world deployment based on cellular radio units. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an initial study investigating the feasibility of ATR for ISAC. Our ATR solution uses a Deep Learning (DL)-based detector to infer the target class directly from the radar images generated by the ISAC system. The DL detector is evaluated with experimental data from a ISAC testbed based on commercially available mmWave radio units in the ARENA 2036 industrial research campus located in Stuttgart, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate accurate classification performance, demonstrating the feasibility of ATR ISAC with cellular hardware in our setup.

            <p>A multiuser uplink transmission framework based on the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed under two operating protocols: segment selection (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). For each protocol, the achievable uplink sum-rate is characterized for both time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Low-complexity placement methods for the pinching antennas (PAs) are developed for both protocols and for both multiple-access schemes. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and show that SWAN achieves higher sum-rate performance than conventional pinching-antenna systems, while SA provides additional performance gains over SS.</p>

            <h2>Expected Revenue, Risk, and Grid Impact of Bitcoin Mining: A Decision-Theoretic Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuting Cai, Ruthav Sadali, Korok Ray, Chao Tian</p>
            <p>Most current assessments use ex post proxies that miss uncertainty and fail to consistently capture the rapid change in bitcoin mining. We introduce a unified, ex ante statistical model that derives expected return, downside risk, and upside potential profit from the first principles of mining: Each hash is a Bernoulli trial with a Bitcoin block difficulty-based success probability. The model yields closed-form expected revenue per hash-rate unit, risk metrics in different scenarios, and upside-profit probabilities for different fleet sizes. Empirical calibration closely matches previously reported observations, yielding a unified, faithful quantification across hardware, pools, and operating conditions. This foundation enables more reliable analysis of mining impacts and behavior.</p>

            <h2>ISAC Network Planning: Sensing Coverage Analysis and 3-D BS Deployment Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Christos Masouros, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extend the coverage but yield marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Roh, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a comprehensive review of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power supply topologies, aiming to bridge the gap between DBD applications and power electronics design. Two key aspects are examined: the dependence of the DBD electrical model on reactor geometry, and application-driven requirements for injected waveform characteristics, including shapes, voltage amplitude, frequency, and modulation techniques. On this basis, the paper systematically reviews two major categories of power supplies: sinusoidal types comprising transformerless and transformer-based resonant inverters, and pulsed power supplies (PPSs). The review summarizes performance trade-offs, highlights untested topologies and emerging applications, and offers guidance for advancing high-performance DBD power supply design for next-generation systems.</p>

            <h2>Power Converter DC Link Ripple and Network Unbalance as Active Constraints in Distribution System Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Deakin, Rahmat Heidari, Xu Deng</p>
            <p>The mitigation of unbalanced grid voltages or currents by voltage source converters results in power ripple on the dc link, and is a key converter design parameter due to hardware or stability considerations. Despite the importance of this issue for system design and operation, the use of Optimal Power Flow (OPF)-based methods capturing the interaction between dc link ripple and converter unbalanced operation has been largely unexplored. In this work, the magnitude of the power ripple is derived for generic multi-terminal converters, then introduced as a bilinear OPF constraint for two-level converter topologies. OPF case studies demonstrate the necessity to model both neutral current and dc link ripple, with tradeoffs between capacitor sizing and leg sizing highlighted for phase current unbalance mitigation applications. Time domain simulations of a grid-connected four-wire voltage source converter verify the accuracy and validity of the algebraic formulation. It is concluded that awareness of dc link ripple impacts and constraints will be of growing importance for distribution system operators.</p>

The proposed strategy is able to meet the strict specifications for HCPV sun trackers despite of mechanical uncertainties (misalignments in the structure itself, misalignment of the solar modules with respect to the wing, etc.) and installation uncertainties (misalignments of the platform with respect to geographical north). Experimental results with an industrial-grade solar tracker showing the validity of the proposed control strategy under sunny and moderate cloudy conditions, as well as with different installation precisions by un-calibrating the system on purpose are exposed.</p>

            <h2>Exact Recourse Functions for Aggregations of EVs Operating in Imbalance Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Mukhi, Licio Romao, Alessandro Abate</p>
            <p>We study optimal charging of large electric vehicle populations that are exposed to a single real-time imbalance price. The problem is naturally cast as a multistage stochastic linear programme (MSLP), which can be solved by algorithms such as Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming. However, these methods scale poorly with the number of devices and stages. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this curse of dimensionality. Building prior work that characterises the aggregate flexibility sets of populations of EVs as a permutahdron, we reformulate the original problem in terms of aggregated quantities. The geometric structure of permutahedra lets us (i) construct an optimal disaggregation policy, (ii) derive an exact, lower-dimensional MSLP, and (iii) characterise the expected recourse function as piecewise affine with a finite, explicit partition. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the slopes and intercepts of each affine region via truncated expectations of future prices, yielding an exact form for the recourse function and first-stage policy. Comprehensive numerical studies validate our claims and demonstrate the practical utility of this work.</p>

            <h2>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gokul Puthumanaillam, Paulo Padrao, Jose Fuentes, Leonardo Bobadilla, Melkior Ornik</p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semih Cayci</p>
            <p>In this work, we establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for the Gauss-Newton method in training neural networks with smooth activations. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow in parameter space induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional embedded submanifold of the function space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we establish geodesic Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Lipschitz-smoothness conditions for the loss under appropriately chosen output scaling, yielding geometric convergence to the optimal in-class predictor at an explicit rate independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix. In the overparameterized regime, we propose adaptive, curvature-aware regularization schedules that ensure fast geometric convergence to a global optimum at a rate independent of the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel and, locally, of the modulus of strong convexity of the loss. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Newton achieves accelerated convergence rates in settings where first-order methods exhibit slow convergence due to ill-conditioned kernel matrices and loss landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ningwei Bai, Chi Pui Chan, Qichen Yin, Tengyang Gong, Yunda Yan, Zezhi Tang</p>
            <p>This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faisal Ahmed</p>
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans. We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification. PseudoColorViT-Alz offers a robust and interpretable framework that outperforms current methods, providing a promising tool to support clinical decision-making and early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative Energy Scheduling of Multi-Microgrids Based on Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</h2>

            <p>With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy, multi-microgrids play an increasingly important role in improving the flexibility and reliability of energy supply. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance.</p>

            <h2>Dispatch-Aware Learning for Optimal Transmission Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Andy Sun, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability and generalization ability.</p>

            <h2>Techno-Economic Case Study of a Rural Local Electricity Community in Switzerland</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerard Marias Gonzalez, Alejandro Pena-Bello, Jérémy Dumoulin, Nicolas Wyrsch</p>
            <p>Local Electricity Communities (communautés électriques locales, CEL) will become operational in Switzerland in 2026, allowing prosumers, consumers, and storage operators within the same municipality and distribution system operator (DSO) area to exchange electricity over the public grid with reduced distribution tariffs. This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement.</p>

            <p>Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Joint Coverage and Electromagnetic Field Exposure Analysis in Downlink and Uplink for RIS-assisted Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Chen, Ahmed Elzanaty, Mustafa A Kishk, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage, especially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted large-scale networks remain open issues. This paper proposes a stochastic geometry (SG) based framework to characterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios. Particularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of RISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power control mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed framework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in downlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided. Additionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a user to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient identification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs. From numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the downlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved SINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS deployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE compliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics through joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in improving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can contribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between coverage and compliance when deploying RISs.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of time-varying constant power loads. Modelling the load demand as a constantly evolving unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, \ie uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. By adopting a suitable control barrier function, we formulate a continuous-time control law and derive analytic conditions on the tuning parameters, such that the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories is bounded. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated both via simulation and real-time HIL scenarios, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.</p>

Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bosen Yang, Kang Ma, Jin Lin, Yonghua Song</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

A new framework is introduced considering an extended set of independent variables for the optimization problem of energy consumption. In this way the number of decision variables is increased, providing extra degrees of freedom to optimize cooling plant operation. The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation solution is deployed for the problem and the proposed method is compared with a similar but static approach showing the benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption.</p>

            <p>Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.</p>

            <h2>A Context-Free Smart Grid Model Using Complex System Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soufian Ben Amor, Alain Bui, Guillaume Guerard</p>
            <p>Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.</p>

            <h2>Joint Power Allocation and Reflecting-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Aided Communications Under CSI Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christos N. Efrem, Ioannis Krikidis</p>
            <p>We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low computational complexity on average.</p>

            <h2>Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grigory Neustroev, Diego A. Tejada-Arango, German Morales-Espana, Mathijs M. de Weerdt</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose the method of hull clustering with blended RPs to enhance traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), approximating the full time horizon more accurately and with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</p>
