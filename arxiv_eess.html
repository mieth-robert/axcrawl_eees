            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Utilization of Distribution System Flexibility for Enhanced TSO-DSO Interoperability: A Novel Machine Learning-Based Optimal Power Flow Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burak Dindar, Can Berk Saner, Hüseyin K. Çakmak, Veit Hagenmeyer</p>
            <p>Due to the transformation of the power system, the effective use of flexibility from the distribution system (DS) is becoming crucial for efficient network management. Leveraging this flexibility requires interoperability among stakeholders, including Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). However, data privacy concerns among stakeholders present significant challenges for utilizing this flexibility effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based method in which the technical constraints of the DSs are represented by ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data. Using these models, the TSO can solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem and directly determine the dispatch of flexibility-providing units (FPUs), in our case, distributed generators (DGs), in a single round of communication. To achieve this, we introduce a novel neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to efficiently represent the feasible region of the DSs, ensuring computational effectiveness. Furthermore, we incorporate various PQ charts rather than idealized ones, demonstrating that the proposed method is adaptable to a wide range of FPU characteristics. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we benchmark it against the standard AC-OPF on multiple DSs with meshed connections and multiple points of common coupling (PCCs) with varying voltage magnitudes. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method achieves performant results while prioritizing data privacy. Additionally, since this method directly determines the dispatch of FPUs, it eliminates the need for an additional disaggregation step. By representing the DSs technical constraints through ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data, the transfer of sensitive information between stakeholders is prevented.</p>

            <h2>Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darío Slaifstein (1), Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli (1), Laura Ramirez-Elizondo (1), Pavol Bauer (1) ((1) Delft University of Technology)</p>
            <p>In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge. Such an operation calls for an energy management system that decides the set points of the primary control layer in the best way possible. This has to fulfill user requirements, minimize costs, and balance local generation with energy storage. Such storage enables building flexibility. This paper presents a novel aging-aware strategy for electrified buildings. The energy management algorithm presented incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between the grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed algorithm can be used to improve grid costs or to protect the batteries (static or electric vehicles). This energy management algorithm can control different cathode chemistries as well as aged and fresh batteries, improving costs with respect to benchmarks for these cases.</p>

            <h2>Learn to Bid as a Price-Maker Wind Power Producer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shobhit Singhal, Marta Fochesato, Liviu Aolaritei, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Atmospheric Sensing and Communications for Resource Allocation in NTNs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Fabio Saggese, Lintao Li, Petar Popovski</p>
            <p>The integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations into 5G and Beyond is essential to achieve truly global connectivity. A distinctive characteristic of LEO mega constellations is that they constitute a global infrastructure with predictable dynamics, which enables the pre-planned allocation of radio resources. However, the different bands that can be used for ground-to-satellite communication are affected differently by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation, which introduces uncertainty on the attenuation of the communication links at high frequencies. Based on this, we present a compelling case for applying integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in heterogeneous and multi-layer LEO satellite constellations over wide areas. Specifically, we propose a sensing-assisted communications framework and frame structure that not only enables the accurate estimation of the atmospheric attenuation in the communication links through sensing but also leverages this information to determine the optimal serving satellites and allocate resources efficiently for downlink communication with users on the ground. The results show that, by dedicating an adequate amount of resources for sensing and solving the association and resource allocation problems jointly, it is feasible to increase the average throughput by 59% and the fairness by 700% when compared to solving these problems separately.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Preserving Mechanisms for Coordinating Airspace Usage in Advanced Air Mobility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chinmay Maheshwari, Maria G. Mendoza, Victoria Marie Tuck, Pan-Yang Su, Victor L. Qin, Sanjit A. Seshia, Hamsa Balakrishnan, Shankar Sastry</p>
            <p>Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations are expected to transform air transportation while challenging current air traffic management practices. By introducing a novel market-based mechanism, we address the problem of on-demand allocation of capacity-constrained airspace to AAM vehicles with heterogeneous and private valuations. We model airspace and air infrastructure as a collection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles that simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region. Vehicles request access to the airspace with trajectories spanning multiple regions at different times. We use the graph structure of our airspace model to formulate the allocation problem as a path allocation problem on a time-extended graph. To ensure the cost information of AAM vehicles remains private, we introduce a novel mechanism that allocates each vehicle a budget of "air-credits" and anonymously charges prices for traversing the edges of the time-extended graph. We seek to compute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints are satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector capacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal for each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to individual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral allocations may not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and computation of a fractional-competitive equilibrium, where allocations can be fractional. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a distributed, iterative, two-step algorithm that: 1) computes a fractional competitive equilibrium, and 2) derives an integral allocation from this equilibrium. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in allocating trajectories for two emerging urban air mobility services: drone delivery and air taxis.</p>

            <h2>Risk-Aware Planning of Power Distribution Systems Using Scalable Cloud Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Poudel, Poorva Sharma, Abhineet Parchure, Daniel Olsen, Sayantan Bhowmik, Tonya Martin, Dylan Locsin, Andrew P. Reiman</p>
            <p>The uncertainty in distribution grid planning is driven by the unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</p>

            <h2>Synthesizing Grid Data with Cyber Resilience and Privacy Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengyang Wu, Vladimir Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Differential privacy (DP) provides a principled approach to synthesizing data (e.g., loads) from real-world power systems while limiting the exposure of sensitive information. However, adversaries may exploit synthetic data to calibrate cyberattacks on the source grids. To control these risks, we propose new DP algorithms for synthesizing data that provide the source grids with both cyber resilience and privacy guarantees. The algorithms incorporate both normal operation and attack optimization models to balance the fidelity of synthesized data and cyber resilience. The resulting post-processing optimization is reformulated as a robust optimization problem, which is compatible with the exponential mechanism of DP to moderate its computational burden.</p>

            <h2>The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary</p>
            <p>Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?" This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost. Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Validation of Distributed Dispatching of Multiple Active Distribution Networks Using the ADMM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthieu Jacobs, Hanmin Cai, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>This paper presents the experimental validation of a framework for the coordinated dispatch and control of multiple active distribution networks (ADNs) hosting distributed energy resource (DER). We show that the presented method, which builds further on work done in [1], effectively allows to control multiple ADNs in a distributed way to ensure they achieve a common objective without revealing information on their DERs capabilities or grid model. This experimental validation is carried out using demonstrators at the DESL of EPFL and the NEST site at Empa, both in Switzerland. The coordination of the systems to share the flexibility of their controllable assets is demonstrated through a set of 24h experiments. Finally, the limitations of the method are discussed and future extensions proposed.</p>

            <h2>Assessment of Cyberattack Detection-Isolation Algorithm for CAV Platoons Using SUMO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy</p>
            <p>A Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon in an evolving real-world driving environment relies strongly on accurate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for its safe and efficient operation. However, a cyberattack on this communication network can corrupt the appropriate control actions, tamper with system measurement, and drive the platoon to unsafe or undesired conditions. As a first step toward practicable resilience against such V2V-V2I attacks, in this paper, we implemented a unified V2V-V2I cyberattack detection scheme and a V2I isolation scheme for a CAV platoon under changing driving conditions in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The implemented algorithm utilizes vehicle-specific residual generators that are designed based on analytical disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity performance constraints. Our case studies include two driving scenarios where highway driving is simulated using the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data and urban driving follows the benchmark EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). The results validate the applicability of the algorithm to ensure CAV cybersecurity and demonstrate the promising potential for practical test-bed implementation in the future.</p>

            <h2>Towards Connected Smart Work Zones: Advancing Work Zone Management through Improved Connectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Nour, Mohamed H. Zaki, Mohamed Abdel-Aty</p>
            <p>Work zones play a key role in road and highway maintenance but can lead to significant risks to both drivers and workers. Smart Work Zones (SWZs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering decision-makers real-time insights into the status of the work zone. By utilizing work zone barrels equipped with sensors and communication nodes, SWZs facilitate collecting and transmitting critical data, including location, traffic density, flow patterns, and worker proximity alerts. In collaboration with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), this study addresses work zone barrel connectivity requirements while considering a cost-effective, low-power, and low-maintenance solution. While the broader project aimed to create a complete SWZ system for the localization of work zone barrels, this paper proposes a novel relay node selection algorithm integrated with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to enhance network performance. The proposed algorithm enhances the communication network performance by selecting specific nodes as relay points, avoiding message flooding in the network. It demonstrates an improvement in message delivery rates, achieving up to a 40% increase over existing methods while ensuring balanced load distribution among nodes. Moreover, it maintains an 80% message delivery rate while minimizing power consumption, outperforming other approaches. This improvement in communication efficiency is critical, as it ensures the accurate transmission and delivery of vital work zone data, allowing for faster and more informed decisions to enhance work zone safety and management.</p>

            <h2>Sensing-Based Beamformed Resource Allocation in Standalone Millimeter-Wave Vehicular Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Traspadini, Anay Ajit Deshpande, Marco Giordani, Chinmay Mahabal, Takayuki Shimizu, Michele Zorzi</p>
            <p>In 3GPP New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), the new standard for next-generation vehicular networks, vehicles can autonomously select sidelink resources for data transmission, which permits network operations without cellular coverage. However, standalone resource allocation is uncoordinated, and is complicated by the high mobility of the nodes that may introduce unforeseen channel collisions (e.g., when a transmitting vehicle changes path) or free up resources (e.g., when a vehicle moves outside of the communication area). Moreover, unscheduled resource allocation is prone to the hidden node and exposed node problems, which are particularly critical considering directional transmissions. In this paper, we implement and demonstrate a new channel access scheme for NR V2X in Frequency Range 2 (FR2), i.e., at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, based on directional and beamformed transmissions along with Sidelink Control Information (SCI) to select resources for transmission. We prove via simulation that this approach can reduce the probability of collision for resource allocation, compared to a baseline solution that does not configure SCI transmissions.</p>

            <h2>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</p>

            <h2>WiFo: Wireless Foundation Model for Channel Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxun Liu, Shijian Gao, Xuanyu Liu, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang</p>
            <p>Channel prediction permits to acquire channel state information (CSI) without signaling overhead. However, almost all existing channel prediction methods necessitate the deployment of a dedicated model to accommodate a specific configuration. Leveraging the powerful modeling and multi-task learning capabilities of foundation models, we propose the first space-time-frequency (STF) wireless foundation model (WiFo) to address time-frequency channel prediction tasks in a one-for-all manner. Specifically, WiFo is initially pre-trained over massive and extensive diverse CSI datasets. Then, the model will be instantly used for channel prediction under various CSI configurations without any fine-tuning. We propose a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based network structure for WiFo to handle heterogeneous STF CSI data, and design several mask reconstruction tasks for self-supervised pre-training to capture the inherent 3D variations of CSI. To fully unleash its predictive power, we build a large-scale heterogeneous simulated CSI dataset consisting of 160K CSI samples for pre-training. Simulations validate its superior unified learning performance across multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot generalization performance via comparisons with other full-shot baselines.</p>

            <h2>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonçalo Hora de Carvalho</p>
            <p>Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</p>

            <h2>Dueling QR Codes: The Hyding of Dr. Jeckyl</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Noever, Forrest McKee</p>
            <p>The paper presents a novel technique for encoding dual messages within standard Quick Response (QR) codes through precise half-pixel module splitting. This work challenges fundamental assumptions about deterministic decoding in the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard while maintaining complete compatibility with existing QR infrastructure. The proposed two-dimensional barcode attack enables angle-dependent message selection while maintaining compatibility with unmodified QR readers and the 100 million US mobile users who use their phone's built-in scanners. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested codes, watermarking, or error correction exploitation, our method achieves true one-to-many mapping by manipulating the physical sampling process built into the QR standard. By preserving critical function patterns while bifurcating data modules, we create automated codes that produce different but valid readings based on camera viewing angle. Experimental results demonstrate successful implementation across multiple use cases, including simple message text pairs, complex URLs (this http URL), and security test patterns for malware and spam detectors (EICAR/GTUBE). Our technique achieves reliable dual-message decoding using standard QR readers at module scales of 9-11 pixels, with successful angle-dependent reading demonstrated across vertical, horizontal, and diagonal orientations. The method's success suggests potential applications beyond QR code phishing ('quishing') including two-factor authentication, anti-counterfeiting, and information density optimization. The half-pixel technique may offer future avenues for similar implementations in other 2D barcode formats such as Data Matrix and Aztec Code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peace Obioma, Obinna Agbodike, Jenhui Chen, Lei Wang</p>
            <p>With the Internet of Things (IoT) fostering seamless device-to-human and device-to-device interactions, the domain of intelligent lighting systems have evolved beyond simple occupancy and daylight sensing towards autonomous monitoring and control of power consumption and illuminance levels. To this regard, this paper proposes a new do-it-yourself (DIY) IoT-based method of smart lighting system featuring an illuminance control algorithm. The design involves the integration of occupancy and presence sensors alongside a communication module, to enable real-time wireless interaction and remote monitoring of the system parameters from any location through an end-user application. A constrained optimization problem was formulated to determine the optimal dimming vector for achieving target illuminance at minimal power consumption. The simplex algorithm was used to solve this problem, and the system's performance was validated through both MATLAB simulations and real-world prototype testing in an indoor office environment. The obtained experimental results demonstrate substantial power savings across multiple user occupancy scenarios, achieving reductions of approx. 80%, 48%, and 26% for one, two, and four user settings, respectively, in comparison to traditional basic lighting installation systems.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Learning-based Offshore Wind Power Prediction Models with Various Feature Combinations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linhan Fang, Fan Jiang, Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Accurate wind speed prediction is crucial for designing and selecting sites for offshore wind farms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting offshore wind power for a site near the Gulf of Mexico by analyzing meteorological data. After collecting and preprocessing meteorological data, nine different input feature combinations were designed to assess their impact on wind power predictions at multiple heights. The results show that using wind speed as the output feature improves prediction accuracy by approximately 10% compared to using wind power as the output. In addition, the improvement of multi-feature input compared with single-feature input is not obvious mainly due to the poor correlation among key features and limited generalization ability of models. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate output features and highlight considerations for using machine learning in wind power forecasting, offering insights that could guide future wind power prediction models and conversion techniques.</p>

In this paper, we present comparative evaluation results of an extensive set of machine learning models for the classification of power quality events, based on their root causes. After extensive experiments using different machine learning libraries, it is observed that the best performing learning models turn out to be Cubic SVM and XGBoost. During error analysis, it is observed that the main source of performance degradation for both models is the classification of ABC faults as ABCG faults, or vice versa. Ultimately, the models achieving the best results will be integrated into the event classification module of a large-scale power quality and grid monitoring system for the Turkish electricity transmission system.</p>

            <h2>An Assessment of the UK Government Clean Energy Strategy for the Year 2030</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony D. Stephens, David R. Walwyn</p>
            <p>In 2024, the UK Government made two striking announcements on its plans to decarbonise the energy system; it pledged GBP22 billion to establish carbon capture and storage hubs on Teesside and Merseyside and released the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. This paper questions the validity of both plans, arguing that they do not take adequate account of the consequences of the highly variable nature of wind and solar generations. Using dynamic models of future UK electricity systems which are designed to take account of these variabilities, it is shown that the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan overestimates the ability of wind and solar generations to decarbonise the electricity system as they increase in size relative to the demand of the electricity system. More importantly, the dynamic models show that most of the achievable decarbonization is the result of increasing wind generation from the current level of around 10 GW to around 20 GW. Increasing wind generation to only 20 GW, rather than to 30 GW as proposed in the Action Plan, should halve the proposed cost, a saving of perhaps GBP 120 billion, with little disbenefit in terms of reduced decarbonization. Furthermore, the dynamic modelling shows that UK gas storage capacity of 7.5 winter days looks hopeless inadequate in comparison with the storage capacities deemed necessary by its continental neighbors. Concern is expressed that a consequence of the Climate Change Act of 2008 requiring the UK to meet arbitrary decarbonization targets is leading government advisors to propose several unproven and therefore highly risky technological solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wouter Zomerdijk, Peter Palensky, Tarek AlSkaif, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>The energy sector's digital transformation brings mutually dependent communication and energy infrastructure, tightening the relationship between the physical and the digital world. Digital twins (DT) are the key concept for this. This paper initially discusses the evolution of the DT concept across various engineering applications before narrowing its focus to the power systems domain. By reviewing different definitions and applications, the authors present a new definition of DTs specifically tailored to power systems. Based on the proposed definition and extensive deliberations and consultations with distribution system operators, energy traders, and municipalities, the authors introduce a vision of a standard DT ecosystem architecture that offers services beyond real-time updates and can seamlessly integrate with existing transmission and distribution system operators' processes while reconciling with concepts such as microgrids and local energy communities based on a system-of-systems view. The authors also discuss their vision related to the integration of power system DTs into various phases of the system's life cycle, such as long-term planning, emphasising challenges that remain to be addressed, such as managing measurement and model errors, and uncertainty propagation. Finally, the authors present their vision of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can enhance several power systems DT modules established in the proposed architecture.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis and Power Allocation for Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Van-Dinh Nguyen, Hieu V. Nguyen, Hien Quoc Ngo, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Markku Juntti</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless communications networks. Its integration with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques promises to leverage substantial spatial beamforming gains for both functionalities. In this work, we consider a massive MIMO-ISAC system employing a uniform planar array with zero-forcing and maximum-ratio downlink transmission schemes combined with monostatic radar-type sensing. Our focus lies on deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communications rate and the Cramér--Rao lower bound (CRLB), which serve as performance metrics for communications and sensing operations, respectively. The expressions enable us to investigate important operational characteristics of massive MIMO-ISAC, including the mutual effects of communications and sensing as well as the advantages stemming from using a very large antenna array for each functionality. Furthermore, we devise a power allocation strategy based on successive convex approximation to maximize the communications rate while guaranteeing the CRLB constraints and transmit power budget. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed power allocation approach.</p>

            <h2>Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao</p>
            <p>This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

            <h2>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaimin Li, Jiahuan Wang, Haixia Cui, Bingpeng Zhou, Pingzhi Fan</p>
            <p>Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E Harshith Kumar Yadav, Rahul Narava, Anshika, Shashi Shekher Jha</p>
            <p>Managing equal charge levels in active cell balancing while charging a Li-ion battery is challenging. An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.</p>

            <h2>Robust Model Predictive Control of Fast Lithium-ion Battery Pretreatment for Safe Recycling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Yuan, Adam Burman, Changfu Zou</p>
            <p>The proper disposal and repurposing of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries are critical for maximizing their environmental benefits. This study introduces a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to optimize the battery discharging process during pre-treatment, ensuring both efficiency and safety. The proposed method explicitly incorporates temperature constraints to prevent overheating and potential hazards. By leveraging a control-oriented equivalent circuit model integrated with thermal dynamics, the MPC algorithm dynamically adjusts the discharging profile to maintain safe operating temperatures. Additionally, the robust controller is designed to account for model mismatches between the nonlinear battery dynamics and the linearized model, ensuring reliable performance under varying conditions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through simulations comparing the robust MPC method with conventional discharging strategies, including constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) and constant current-constant temperature (CC-CT) methods. Results indicate that the robust MPC framework significantly reduces discharging time while adhering to safety constraints, offering a promising solution for the recycling and second-life applications of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Song, Xinyi Jing, Jianyong Ding, Ciwei Gao, Mingyu Yan, Wensheng Luo, Mariusz Malinowski</p>
            <p>Virtual energy stations (VESs) work as retailers to provide electricity and natural gas sale services for integrated energy systems (IESs), and guide IESs energy consumption behaviors to tackle the varying market prices via integrated demand response (IDR). However, IES customers are risk averse and show low enthusiasm in responding to the IDR incentive signals. To address this problem, exergy is utilized to unify different energies and allowed to be virtually stored and withdrawn for arbitrage by IESs. The whole incentive mechanism operating process is innovatively characterized by a virtual exergy battery. Peer to peer (P2P) exergy trading based on shared exergy storage is also developed to reduce the energy cost of IESs without any extra transmission fee. In this way, IES can reduce the economic loss risk caused by the market price fluctuation via the different time (time dimension), multiple energy conversion (energy dimension), and P2P exergy trading (space dimension) arbitrage. Moreover, the optimal scheduling of VES and IESs is modeled by a bilevel optimization model. The consensus based alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this problem in a distributed way. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism and show that the shared exergy storage can enhance the benefits of different type IESs by 18.96%, 3.49%, and 3.15 %, respectively.</p>

            <h2>A Profit Sharing Mechanism for Coordinated Power Traffic System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Sima, Mingyu Yan, Jianfeng Wen, Wensheng Luo, Mariusz Malinowski</p>
            <p>During the scheduling process, the traffic network operator (TNO) and the distribution network operator (DNO) act noncooperatively. Under the TNO management, the distribution of charging loads may exacerbate the local supply demand imbalance in the power distribution network (PDN), which negatively impacts the economic operation of the PDN. This paper proposes a profitsharing mechanism based on the principle of incentive compatibility for coordinating the traffic network (TN) and the PDN to minimize the operation cost of PDN. Under this mechanism, the scheduling process of the power traffic system is divided into two stages. At the prescheduling stage, the TNO allocates traffic flow and charging loads without considering the operation of the PDN, after which the DNO schedules and obtains the original cost. At the rescheduling stage, the DNO shares part of benefits of the optimal operation to the TNO to redispatch the EV charging to obtain a more effective charging plan, thus minimize the overall cost of PDN. Then, a bilevel model is developed to simulate the operation of the power traffic system with the proposed sharing scheme and identify the best sharing ratio. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the PDN can achieve the minimum total cost and simultaneously the TN can also benefit from the proposed profit sharing mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuezao Wang, Yijun Xu, Wei Gu, Kai Liu, Shuai Lu, Mert Korkali, Lamine Mili</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewables is replacing traditional synchronous generation in modern power systems with low-inertia asynchronous converter-interfaced generators (CIGs). This penetration threatens the dynamic stability of the modern power system. To assess the latter, we resort to the critical clearing time (CCT) as a stability index, which is typically computed through a large number of time-domain simulations. This is especially true for CIG-embedded power systems, where the complexity of the model is further increased. To alleviate the computing burden, we developed a trajectory sensitivity-based method for assessing the CCT in power systems with synchronous and asynchronous generators. This allows us to obtain the CCT cost-effectively. The simulation results reveal the excellent performance of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaqi Wu, Jingyi Yuan, Yang Weng, Guangwen Wang</p>
            <p>Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network (NN) parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of NN, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.</p>

            <h2>Robust Co-Optimization of Distribution Network Hardening and Mobile Resource Scheduling with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donglai Ma, Xiaoyu Cao, Bo Zeng, Chen Chen, Qiaozhu Zhai, Qing-Shan Jia, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>This paper studies the robust co-planning of proactive network hardening and mobile hydrogen energy resources (MHERs) scheduling, which is to enhance the resilience of power distribution network (PDN) against the disastrous events. A decision-dependent robust optimization model is formulated with min-max resilience constraint and discrete recourse structure, which helps achieve the load survivability target considering endogenous uncertainties. Different from the traditional model with a fixed uncertainty set, we adopt a dynamic representation that explicitly captures the endogenous uncertainties of network contingency as well as the available hydrogen storage levels of MHERs, which induces a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Also, the multi-period adaptive routing and energy scheduling of MHERs are modeled as a mixed-integer recourse problem for further decreasing the resilience cost. Then, a nested parametric column-and-constraint generation (N-PC&CG) algorithm is customized and developed to solve this challenging formulation. By leveraging the structural property of the DDU set as well as the combination of discrete recourse decisions and the corresponding extreme points, we derive a strengthened solution scheme with nontrivial enhancement strategies to realize efficient and exact computation. Numerical results on 14-bus test system and 56-bus real-world distribution network demonstrate the resilience benefits and economical feasibility of the proposed method under different damage severity levels. Moreover, the enhanced N-PC&CG shows a superior solution capability to support prompt decisions for resilient planning with DDU models.</p>

            <h2>Robust Full-Space Physical Layer Security for STAR-RIS-Aided Wireless Networks: Eavesdropper with Uncertain Location and Channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Xiao, Xiaoyan Hu, Ang Li, Wenjie Wang, Kun Yang</p>
            <p>A robust full-space physical layer security (PLS) transmission scheme is proposed in this paper considering the full-space wiretapping challenge of wireless networks supported by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Different from the existing schemes, the proposed PLS scheme takes account of the uncertainty on the eavesdropper's position within the 360$^\circ$ service area offered by the STAR-RIS. Specifically, the large system analytical method is utilized to derive the asymptotic expression of the average security rate achieved by the security user, considering that the base station (BS) only has the statistical information of the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and the uncertainty of its location. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLS scheme, we first formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted sum rate of the security user and the public user. This optimization is conducted under the power allocation constraint, and some practical limitations for STAR-RIS implementation, through jointly designing the active and passive beamforming variables. A novel iterative algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and cross-entropy optimization (CEO) methods is proposed to effectively address the established non-convex optimization problem with discrete variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed robust PLS scheme can effectively mitigate the information leakage across the entire coverage area of the STAR-RIS-assisted system, leading to superior performance gain when compared to benchmark schemes encompassing traditional RIS-aided scheme.</p>

We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Zahid Butt, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Traditional microgrid planning often overlooks PV and BESS degradation or relies on complex, downscaled models, leading to unreliable, costly and suboptimal investment decisions. This paper presents a degradation-based investment optimization (DBIO) methodology for long-term microgrid planning. The model optimally sizes and schedules PV, BESS, and controllable distributed energy resources, while considering technical, financial, and degradation characteristics. We first developed a cumulative multi-year optimization model as a benchmark, excluding BESS efficiency fade and capacity degradation that would be captured in the next step, to ensure convergence. Subsequently, a yearly validation model was iteratively solved for each year in the planning horizon, updating energy efficiencies of PV and BESS, along with BESS capacity, based on annual degradation, ensuring the reliability of initial solution. An iterative refinement process further adjusts BESS capacity to eliminate load shedding while minimizing costs. Sensitivity analyses on PV efficiency degradation rates, second-life battery (SLB) capital cost, and grid tariffs further explore their economic implications. Results show that degradation significantly impacts resource allocation, with ignored degradation risking reliability, potential load shedding, and blackout costs, while SLBs provide cost-saving opportunities. The DBIO framework offers a computationally efficient and scalable solution for microgrid planning, with broader applications in grid-scale asset management.</p>

            <h2>A Weighted Predict-and-Optimize Framework for Power System Operation Considering Varying Impacts of Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingrui Zhuang, Lin Cheng, Can Wan, Rui Xie, Ning Qi, Yue Chen</p>
            <p>Integrating prediction and optimization enhances decision-making quality by yielding near optimal solutions. Given that prediction errors associated with multiple uncertainties have varying impacts on downstream decision-making, improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative importance of each uncertainty for specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of weighted predictions for downstream optimization as compared to perfect predictions. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, WPO framework enables adaptive uncertainty impact assessment and integrated learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we construct a surrogate model to establish the mapping between weights and PDPL, where multi-task learning and enhanced graph convolutional networks are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms traditional methods by achieving a much smaller PDPL within acceptable computational time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixiao Ma, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>The growing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into modern power systems poses significant challenges for maintaining reliable operation under dynamic and constrained conditions. This paper focuses on the power tracking problem for grid-connected IBRs, addressing the complexities introduced by voltage and power factor constraints. Voltage constraints, being time-varying and nonlinear input constraints, often conflict with power factor constraints, which are state constraints. These conflicts, coupled with stability requirements, add substantial complexity to control design. To overcome these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient static state-feedback controller that guarantees stability and satisfies operational constraints. The concept of achievability is introduced to evaluate whether power setpoints can be accurately tracked while adhering to all constraints. Using a parameterization framework and the S-lemma, we develop criteria to assess and maximize the continuous achievable region for IBR operation. This framework allows system operators to ensure safety and stability by precomputing a finite set of control gains, significantly reducing online computational requirements. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling time-varying grid disturbances and achieving reliable control performance.</p>

            <p>As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale.

The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism.

            <h2>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper</p>
            <p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-agent Systems via CBF-inspired Risk Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Siwon Jo, Yupeng Yang, Wenhao Luo</p>
            <p>Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock -- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments.</p>

            <h2>A Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyang Huang, Min Xiong, Yang Liu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <h2>PI-Controlled Variable Time-Step Power System Simulation Using an Adaptive Order Differential Transformation Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyang Huang, Yang Liu, Kai Sun, Feng Qiu</p>
            <p>Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.</p>

            <h2>Analysis and Mitigation of Cascading Failures Using a Stochastic Interaction Graph with Eigen-analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenping Guo, Xiaowen Su, Kai Sun, Byungkwon Park, Srdjan Simunovic</p>
            <p>In studies on complex network systems using graph theory, eigen-analysis is typically performed on an undirected graph model of the network. However, when analyzing cascading failures in a power system, the interactions among failures suggest the need for a directed graph beyond the topology of the power system to model directions of failure propagation. To accurately quantify failure interactions for effective mitigation strategies, this paper proposes a stochastic interaction graph model and associated eigen-analysis. Different types of modes on failure propagations are defined and characterized by the eigenvalues of a stochastic interaction matrix, whose absolute values are unity, zero, or in between. Finding and interpreting these modes helps identify the probable patterns of failure propagation, either local or widespread, and the participating components based on eigenvectors. Then, by lowering the failure probabilities of critical components highly participating in a mode of widespread failures, cascading can be mitigated. The validity of the proposed stochastic interaction graph model, eigen-analysis and the resulting mitigation strategies is demonstrated using simulated cascading failure data on an NPCC 140-bus system.</p>

            <h2>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Design for IRS-aided MIMO ISAC Based on Sensing Mutual Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Li, Gui Zhou, Tantao Gong, Nan Liu, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler, Steven Low</p>
            <p>We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an optimization framework for Formula 1 racing that integrates multi-agent interactions, aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management. By employing game-theoretic methods, we formulate the minimum lap time problem as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game. Exploiting their structural similarities, we compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics and strategic dominance. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of jointly optimizing physical interactions, energy management, and trajectory, highlighting their strong interdependence. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals characteristic strategic behaviors observed in real-world racing. The proposed methodology contributes towards realistic Formula 1 race strategy optimizations, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Zhao, Umar Salman, Zongjie Wang</p>
            <p>This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment model for power distribution networks with a focus on the influence of climate conditions and vegetation management on outage risks. Using a dataset comprising outage records, meteorological indicators, and vegetation metrics, this paper develops a logistic regression model that outperformed several alternatives, effectively identifying risk factors in highly imbalanced data. Key features impacting outages include wind speed, vegetation density, quantified as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and snow type, with wet snow and autumn conditions exhibiting the strongest positive effects. The analysis also shows complex interactions, such as the combined effect of wind speed and EVI, suggesting that vegetation density can moderate the impact of high winds on outages. Simulation case studies, based on a test dataset of 618 samples, demonstrated that the model achieved an 80\% match rate with real-world data within an error tolerance of \(\pm 0.05\), showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model while highlighting its potential to inform preventive strategies for mitigating outage risks in power distribution networks under high-risk environmental conditions. Future work will integrate vegetation height data from Lidar and explore alternative modeling approaches to capture potential non-linear relationships.</p>

            <h2>Context-aware Constrained Reinforcement Learning Based Energy-Efficient Power Scheduling for Non-stationary XR Data Traffic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kexuan Wang, An Liu</p>
            <p>In XR downlink transmission, energy-efficient power scheduling (EEPS) is essential for conserving power resource while delivering large data packets within hard-latency constraints. Traditional constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithms show promise in EEPS but still struggle with non-convex stochastic constraints, non-stationary data traffic, and sparse delayed packet dropout feedback (rewards) in XR. To overcome these challenges, this paper models the EEPS in XR as a dynamic parameter-constrained Markov decision process (DP-CMDP) with a varying transition function linked to the non-stationary data traffic and solves it by a proposed context-aware constrained reinforcement learning (CACRL) algorithm, which consists of a context inference (CI) module and a CRL module. The CI module trains an encoder and multiple potential networks to characterize the current transition function and reshape the packet dropout rewards according to the context, transforming the original DP-CMDP into a general CMDP with immediate dense rewards. The CRL module employs a policy network to make EEPS decisions under this CMDP and optimizes the policy using a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method, which is better suited for non-convex stochastic constraints. Finally, theoretical analyses provide deep insights into the CADAC algorithm, while extensive simulations demonstrate that it outperforms advanced baselines in both power conservation and satisfying packet dropout constraints.</p>

            <h2>Optimal ISAC Beamforming Structure and Efficient Algorithms for Sum Rate and CRLB Balancing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Fang, Mengyuan Ma, Markku Juntti, Nir Shlezinger, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Nhan Thanh Nguyen</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to unify wireless communications and radar sensing, enabling efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. A core challenge with realizing the gains of ISAC stems from the unique challenges of dual purpose beamforming design due to the highly non-convex nature of key performance metrics such as sum rate for communications and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity structured approach to ISAC beamforming optimization to simultaneously enhance spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm which transforms the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex subproblems ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed SCA framework and the Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal beamforming structure for CRLB optimization in ISAC systems. Our findings characterize the reduction in radar streams one can employ without affecting performance. This enables a dimensionality reduction that enhances computational efficiency. Numerical simulations validate that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance to the considered benchmarks while requiring much lower computational costs.</p>

            <p>Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Eichelbeck, Hannah Markgraf, Matthias Althoff</p>
            <p>The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Mughees, Yuzhuo Li, Yize Chen, Yunwei Ryan Li</p>
            <p>Recent research shows large-scale AI-centric data centers could experience rapid fluctuations in power demand due to varying computation loads, such as sudden spikes from inference or interruption of training large language models (LLMs). As a consequence, such huge and fluctuating power demand pose significant challenges to both data center and power utility operation. Accurate short-term power forecasting allows data centers and utilities to dynamically allocate resources and power large computing clusters as required. However, due to the complex data center power usage patterns and the black-box nature of the underlying AI algorithms running in data centers, explicit modeling of AI-data center is quite challenging. Alternatively, to deal with this emerging load forecasting problem, we propose a data-driven workflow to model and predict the short-term electricity load in an AI-data center, and such workflow is compatible with learning-based algorithms such as LSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN. We validate our framework, which achieves decent accuracy on data center GPU short-term power consumption. This provides opportunity for improved power management and sustainable data center operations.</p>

            <p>Grid edge resources refer to distributed energy resources (DERs) located on the consumer side of the electrical grid, controlled by consumers rather than utility companies. Integrating DERs with real-time electricity pricing can better align distributed supply with system demand, improving grid efficiency and reliability. However, DER owners, known as prosumers, often lack the expertise and resources to directly participate in wholesale energy markets, limiting their ability to fully realize the economic potential of their assets. Meanwhile, as DER adoption grows, the number of prosumers participating in the energy system is expected to increase significantly, creating additional challenges in coordination and market participation. To address these challenges, we propose a mean-field game framework that enables prosumers to autonomously learn optimal decision policies based on dynamic market prices and their variable solar generation. Our framework is designed to accommodate heterogeneous agents and demonstrates the existence of a mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in a wholesale energy market with many prosumers. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm that automates prosumers' resource control, facilitating real-time decision-making for energy storage management. Numerical experiments suggest that our approach converges towards an MFE and effectively reduces peak loads and price volatility, especially during periods of external demand or supply shocks. This study highlights the potential of a fully decentralized approach to integrating DERs into wholesale markets while improving market efficiency.</p>

            <p>This study presents an integrated energy management strategy for cost optimization in multi-energy community microgrids (MGs). The proposed approach combines storage-based peak shaving, economic dispatch of diesel generators, and efficient utilization of renewable energy sources to enhance energy management in community MGs. The efficacy of the energy management system (EMS) was validated through a simulation case study for a rural Australian community. The results demonstrate that the proposed EMS effectively reduces the peak energy demand by up to 43%, lowers operational costs by 84.63% (from $189,939/year to $29,188/year), and achieves a renewable energy utilization of 92.3%, up from 47.8% in the base system. Furthermore, the levelized cost of energy was reduced by 14.21% to $0.163/kWh. The strategy ensures an uninterrupted power supply during grid outages by utilizing DGs and battery energy storage systems. The environmental benefits included a 196.4% reduction in CO2 emissions and 100% reductions in CO, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. These findings validate the feasibility of the proposed EMS in achieving cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable energy management in community MGs. These findings contribute to the field by introducing a novel approach and demonstrating the practical feasibility of multi-energy MGs.</p>

            <p>The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify the optimal design for each option. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the evolution of the Finnish electric energy system up to 2035, focusing on the likelihood of different development paths. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of an extensive Bayesian Network, designed to model and analyse the evolution of power generation capacity mix, assess the likelihood of different grid management scenarios, and understand the causal relationships underlying these scenarios. A target optimisation was carried out using the constructed Bayesian Network to explore possibilities to minimise grid management complexity. The results of the optimisation reveal that the authorities and stakeholders should prioritise increasing demand response, gas power, and battery storage capacities. These mature technologies are well-suited to guarantee energy adequacy during peak consumption periods, which in Finland typically occur during consecutive cold, dark and windless winter weeks. Although this study focuses on the evolution of the Finnish power grid, the constructed Bayesian Network approach is broadly applicable and can be utilised to explore causal relationships in other countries by employing the designed questionnaire and engaging a panel of experts specific to the country's energy infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Assessing Electricity Network Capacity Requirements for Industrial Decarbonisation in Great Britain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Gailani, Peter Taylor</p>
            <p>Decarbonising the industrial sector is vital to reach net zero targets. The deployment of industrial decarbonisation technologies is expected to increase industrial electricity demand in many countries and this may require upgrades to the existing electricity network or new network investment. While the infrastructure requirements to support the introduction of new fuels and technologies in industry, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage are often discussed, the need for investment to increase the capacity of the electricity network to meet increasing industrial electricity demands is often overlooked in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying the requirements for additional electricity network capacity to support the decarbonisation of industrial sectors across Great Britain (GB). The Net Zero Industrial Pathways model is used to predict the future electricity demand from industrial sites to 2050 which is then compared spatially to the available headroom across the distribution network in GB. The results show that network headroom is sufficient to meet extra capacity demands from industrial sites over the period to 2030 in nearly all GB regions and network scenarios. However, as electricity demand rises due to increased electrification across all sectors and industrial decarbonisation accelerates towards 2050, the network will need significant new capacity (71 GW + by 2050) particularly in the central, south, and north-west regions of England, and Wales. Without solving these network constraints, around 65% of industrial sites that are large point sources of emissions would be constrained in terms of electric capacity by 2040. These sites are responsible for 69% of industrial point source emissions.</p>

            <p>The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</p>

            <h2>Fault Localization and State Estimation of Power Grid under Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
            <p>Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) refer to those attacks on power grids by disturbing/cutting off physical transmission lines and meanwhile blocking transmission of measurement data to dwarf or delay the system protection and recovery actions. Such fierce hostile attacks impose critical threats to the modern power grids when there is a fusion of power grids and telecommunication technologies. In this paper, we investigate the fault diagnosis problem of faulty transmission lines under a broader spectrum of PCPA for a linearized (or DC) power flow model. The physical attack mechanism of PCPA includes not only disconnection but also admittance value modification on transmission lines, for example, by invading distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To tackle the problem, we first recover the information of voltage phase angles within the attacked area. Using the information of voltage phase angle and power injection of buses, a graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL) algorithm is proposed to find the locations of the physical attacks. By capitalizing on the feature extraction capability of the GAT on graph data, the fault localization algorithm outperforms the existing results when under cyber attacks, e.g., denial of service (DoS) attacks. A line state identification algorithm is then developed to identify the states of the transmission lines within the attacked area. Specifically, the algorithm restores the power injection of buses within the attacked area and then identities the state of all the transmission lines within the attacked area by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Experimental simulations are effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu</p>
            <p>Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Load Balancing for EV Charging Stations Using Reinforcement Learning and Demand Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hesam Mosalli, Saba Sanami, Yu Yang, Hen-Geul Yeh, Amir G. Aghdam</p>
            <p>This paper presents a method for load balancing and dynamic pricing in electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance network performance. The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Model Based Probabilistic Day-ahead Load Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Lin, Han Guo, Jianhui Wang</p>
            <p>Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.</p>

            <h2>Physically Large Apertures for Wireless Power Transfer: Performance and Regulatory Aspects</h2>

            <p>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising service for the Internet of Things, providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution to deploy so-called energy-neutral devices on a massive scale. The power received at the device side decays rapidly with the distance from a conventional transmit antenna with a physically small aperture. New opportunities arise from the transition from conventional far-field beamforming to near-field beam focusing. We argue that a "physically large" aperture, i.e., large w.r.t. the distance to the receiver, enables a power budget that remains practically independent of distance. Distance-dependent array gain patterns allow focusing the power density maximum precisely at the device location, while reducing the power density near the infrastructure. The physical aperture size is a key resource in enabling efficient yet regulatory-compliant WPT. We use real-world measurements to demonstrate that a regulatory-compliant system operating at sub-10GHz frequencies can increase the power received at the device into the milliwatt range. Our empirical demonstration shows that power-optimal near-field beam focusing inherently exploits multipath propagation, yielding both increased WPT efficiency and improved human exposure safety in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p>Accurately visualizing and editing tumor progression in medical imaging is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical communication. To address the challenges of subjectivity and limited precision in existing methods, we propose SkEditTumor, a sketch-based diffusion model for controllable tumor progression editing. By leveraging sketches as structural priors, our method enables precise modifications of tumor regions while maintaining structural integrity and visual realism. We evaluate SkEditTumor on four public datasets - BraTS, LiTS, KiTS, and MSD-Pancreas - covering diverse organs and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior image fidelity and segmentation accuracy. Our contributions include a novel integration of sketches with diffusion models for medical image editing, fine-grained control over tumor progression visualization, and extensive validation across multiple datasets, setting a new benchmark in the field.</p>

            <p>With increased global warming, there has been a significant emphasis to replace fossil fuel-dependent energy sources with clean, renewable sources. These new-age energy systems are becoming more complex with an increasing proportion of renewable energy sources (like solar and wind), energy storage systems (like batteries), and demand side control in the mix. Most new-age sources being highly dependent on weather and climate conditions bring about high variability and uncertainty. Energy operators rely on such uncertain data to make different planning and operations decisions periodically, and sometimes in real-time, to maintain the grid stability and optimize their objectives (cost savings, carbon footprint, etc.). Hitherto, operators mostly rely on domain knowledge, heuristics, or solve point problems to take decisions. These approaches fall short because of their specific assumptions and limitations. Further, there is a lack of a unified framework for both research and production environments at scale. In this paper, we propose EnCortex to address these challenges. EnCortex provides a general, easy-to-use, extensible, and scalable energy decision framework that enables operators to plan, build and execute their real-world scenarios efficiently. We show that using EnCortex, we can define and compose complex new-age scenarios, owing to industry-standard abstractions of energy entities and the modularity of the framework. EnCortex provides a foundational structure to support several state-of-the-art optimizers with minimal effort. EnCortex supports both quick developments for research prototypes and scaling the solutions to production environments. We demonstrate the utility of EnCortex with three complex new-age real-world scenarios and show that significant cost and carbon footprint savings can be achieved.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Energy-Trajectory Economic Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Surface Vehicles under Disturbances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongqi Deng, Yuan Wang, Jian Huang, Hui Zhang, Yaonan Wang</p>
            <p>The paper proposes a novel Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to simultaneously address path following accuracy and energy constraints under environmental disturbances. By formulating lateral deviations as energy-equivalent penalties in the cost function, our method enables explicit trade-offs between tracking precision and energy consumption. Furthermore, a motion-dependent decomposition technique is proposed to estimate terminal energy costs based on vehicle dynamics. Compared with the existing EMPC method, simulations with real-world ocean disturbance data demonstrate the controller's energy consumption with a 0.06 energy increase while reducing cross-track errors by up to 18.61. Field experiments conducted on an ASV equipped with an Intel N100 CPU in natural lake environments validate practical feasibility, achieving 0.22 m average cross-track error at nearly 1 m/s and 10 Hz control frequency. The proposed scheme provides a computationally tractable solution for ASVs operating under resource constraints.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces the concept of wireless-powered zero-energy reconfigurable intelligent surface (zeRIS), and investigates a wireless-powered zeRIS aided communication system in terms of security, reliability and energy efficiency. In particular, we propose three new wireless-powered zeRIS modes: 1) in mode-I, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of information user to maximize the reliability of the system; 2) in mode-II, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of cooperative jamming user to maximize the security of the system; 3) in mode-III, N1 and N2 (N1+N2=N) reconfigurable reflecting elements are respectively adjusted to the optimal phase shift designs of information user and cooperative jamming user to balance the reliability and security of the system. Then, we propose three new metrics, i.e., joint outage probability (JOP), joint intercept probability (JIP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), and analyze their closed-form expressions in three modes, respectively. The results show that under high transmission power, all the diversity gains of three modes are 1, and the JOPs of mode-I, mode-II and mode-III are improved by increasing the number of zeRIS elements, which are related to N2, N, and N^2_1, respectively. In addition, mode-I achieves the best JOP, while mode-II achieves the best JIP among three modes. We exploit two security-reliability trade-off (SRT) metrics, i.e., JOP versus JIP, and normalized joint intercept and outage probability (JIOP), to reveal the SRT performance of the proposed three modes. It is obtained that mode-II outperforms the other two modes in the JOP versus JIP, while mode-III and mode-II achieve the best performance of normalized JIOP at low and high transmission power, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhou Xiao, Senchun Chai, Li Dai, Yuanqing Xia, Runqi Chai</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of amplitude-unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</p>

            <h2>ECNN: A Low-complex, Adjustable CNN for Industrial Pump Monitoring Using Vibration Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Ney, Norbert Wehn</p>
            <p>Industrial pumps are essential components in various sectors, such as manufacturing, energy production, and water treatment, where their failures can cause significant financial and safety risks. Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanyu Cao, Takuya Maekawa, Kazuya Ohara, Yasue Kishino</p>
            <p>This study proposes a new deep learning method for reconstructing depth images of moving objects within a specific area using Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). The Wi-Fi-based depth imaging technique has novel applications in domains such as security and elder care. However, reconstructing depth images from CSI is challenging because learning the mapping function between CSI and depth images, both of which are high-dimensional data, is particularly difficult. To address the challenge, we propose a new approach called Wi-Depth. The main idea behind the design of Wi-Depth is that a depth image of a moving object can be decomposed into three core components: the shape, depth, and position of the target. Therefore, in the depth-image reconstruction task, Wi-Depth simultaneously estimates the three core pieces of information as auxiliary tasks in our proposed VAE-based teacher-student architecture, enabling it to output images with the consistency of a correct shape, depth, and position. In addition, the design of Wi-Depth is based on our idea that this decomposition efficiently takes advantage of the fact that shape, depth, and position relate to primitive information inferred from CSI such as angle-of-arrival, time-of-flight, and Doppler frequency shift.</p>

Drawing inspiration from the natural f light dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.</p>

            <p>In this work, image analysis techniques used in astrophysics to detect low-contrast signals have been adapted in the processing of Computed Tomography (CT) images, combining Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) and machine learning techniques. Several CT acquisitions were performed using a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different diameters producing objects with different contrasts respect to background. The images of the phantom, tilted by a known angle with respect to the tomograph axis (to mimic the casual orientation of a clinical lesion), were acquired at various radiation doses (CTDIvol) and at different slice's thicknesses. The success in detecting the signal in the single image (slice) was always greater than 60%. The axis of each insert has always been correctly identified. A super-resolution 2D image was then generated by projecting the individual slices of the scan along this axis, thus increasing the CNR of the object scanned as a whole. CVT holds great promise for future use in medical imaging, for the identification of low-contrast lesions in homogeneous organs, such as the liver.</p>

            <p>With transformer-based models and the pretrain-finetune paradigm becoming mainstream, the high storage and deployment costs of individual finetuned models on multiple tasks pose critical challenges. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights). However, existing methods usually face problems including data accessibility and training requirements. To tackle this issue, we introduce Delta-DCT, the first data-free delta compression method inspired by classic JPEG image compression, leveraging the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We first (a) group delta parameters within a layer into patches. Then we (b) assess the importance of each patch and allocate them with different quantization bit-widths. Afterwards, we (c) convert these patches to the DCT domain and conduct quantization to each patch based on the allocated bit-width. The proposed Delta-DCT does not require any training or data calibration, while achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing original finetuned models under 1-bit equivalent delta compression ratios on different kinds of models including: (1) recently-released LLMs of different sizes from 7B to 13B, (2) relatively smaller language models including RoBERTa and T5 models, (3) variants of vision transformer models, and (4) multi-modal BEiT-3 models.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system where distributed access points (APs) perform integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) tasks, enabling simultaneous user communication and target detection/tracking. A unified framework and signal model are developed for the detection of potential targets and tracking of previously detected ones, even in arbitrary positions. Leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test technique, novel detection/tracking algorithms are proposed to handle unknown target responses and interference. Scalable AP-user and AP-target association rules are evaluated, explicitly considering multi-zone sensing scenarios. Additionally, a scalable power control mechanism extends fractional power control principles to ISAC, balancing power allocation between communication and sensing tasks. For benchmarking, a non-scalable power control optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the minimum user data rate while ensuring a Quality of Service constraint for sensing, solved via successive convex approximation. Extensive numerical results validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in both communication and sensing, revealing the impact of interference from other targets, and highlighting fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performance.</p>

Feature embeddings from each modality are concatenated to form a multimodal vector, which is then used to predict emotion and sentiment labels. The multimodal system demonstrates superior performance compared to unimodal approaches, achieving an accuracy of 66.36% for emotion recognition and 72.15% for sentiment analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyu Li, Yihong Cao, Hao Shi, Yongsheng Zang, Xuan He, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li</p>
            <p>The exploration of Bird's-Eye View (BEV) mapping technology has driven significant innovation in visual perception technology for autonomous driving. BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping.

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels by intelligently regulating the phase shifts of reflecting elements. Recently, various codebook schemes have been utilized to optimize the reflection coefficients (RCs); however, the selection of the optimal codeword is usually obtained by evaluating a metric of interest. In this letter, we propose a novel weighted design on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook to obtain the optimal RCs for RIS-assisted point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol where we configure the RIS RCs using the DFT codebook to obtain a set of observations through the uplink training process. Secondly, based on these observed samples, the Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to optimize the weights in an iterative manner, which could result in a higher channel capacity for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of different codeword configuration orders on system performance and design an efficient codeword configuration method based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juncheng Wang, Chao Xu, Cheng Yu, Lei Shang, Zhe Hu, Shujun Wang, Liefeng Bo</p>
            <p>Video-to-audio generation is essential for synthesizing realistic audio tracks that synchronize effectively with silent videos. Following the perspective of extracting essential signals from videos that can precisely control the mature text-to-audio generative diffusion models, this paper presents how to balance the representation of mel-spectrograms in terms of completeness and complexity through a new approach called Mel Quantization-Continuum Decomposition (Mel-QCD). We decompose the mel-spectrogram into three distinct types of signals, employing quantization or continuity to them, we can effectively predict them from video by a devised video-to-all (V2X) predictor. Then, the predicted signals are recomposed and fed into a ControlNet, along with a textual inversion design, to control the audio generation process. Our proposed Mel-QCD method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across eight metrics, evaluating dimensions such as quality, synchronization, and semantic consistency. Our codes and demos will be released at \href{Website}{this https URL}.</p>

            <h2>Sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to time-varying parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Zagorowska, Lars Imsland</p>
            <p>Online Feedback Optimization uses optimization algorithms as dynamic systems to design optimal control inputs. The results obtained from Online Feedback Optimization depend on the setup of the chosen optimization algorithm. In this work we analyse the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the parameters of projected gradient descent as the algorithm of choice. We derive closed-form expressions for sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the parameters of the projected gradient and to time-varying model mismatch. The formulas are then used for analysis of model mismatch in a gas lift optimization problem. The results of the case study indicate that the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the model mismatch depends on how long the controller has been running, with decreasing sensitivity to mismatch in individual timesteps for long operation times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianpeng Zou, Zhanfeng Zhong, Jintao Wang, Zheng Shi, Guanghua Yang, Shaodan Ma</p>
            <p>In this letter, we investigate a coordinated multiple point (CoMP)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that supports multiple users and targets. Multiple base stations (BSs) employ a coordinated power allocation strategy to serve their associated single-antenna communication users (CUs) while utilizing the echo signals for joint radar target (RT) detection. The probability of detection (PoD) of the CoMP-ISAC system is then proposed for assessing the sensing performance. To maximize the sum rate while ensuring the PoD for each RT and adhering to the total transmit power budget across all BSs, we introduce an efficient power allocation strategy. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the analytical findings, demonstrating that the proposed power allocation scheme effectively enhances the sum rate while satisfying the sensing requirements.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Baheri, Cecilia O. Alm</p>
            <p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</p>

            <p>Within the context of renewable energy communities, this paper focuses on optimal operation of producers equipped with energy storage systems in the presence of demand response. A novel strategy for optimal scheduling of the storage systems of the community members under price-volume demand response programs, is devised. The underlying optimization problem is designed as a low-complexity mixed-integer linear program that scales well with the community size. Once the optimal solution is found, an algorithm for distributing the demand response rewards is introduced in order to guarantee fairness among participants. The proposed approach ensures increased benefits for producers joining a community compared to standalone operation.</p>

            <h2>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhuo Li, Jiakang Zheng, Bokai Xu, Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Bo Ai</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luigi Russo, Antonietta Sorriso, Silvia Liberata Ullo, Paolo Gamba</p>
            <p>Land Cover (LC) mapping using satellite imagery is critical for environmental monitoring and management. Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p>

            <h2>Virtual VNA 3.0: Unambiguous Scattering Matrix Estimation for Non-Reciprocal Systems by Leveraging Tunable and Coupled Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp del Hougne</p>
            <p>We present the "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique for estimating the scattering matrix of a \textit{non-reciprocal}, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using a single measurement setup involving a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only $N_\mathrm{A}<N$ ports -- thus eliminating the need for any reconnections. We partition the DUT ports into $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" and $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports. We connect the accessible ports to the VNA and the NDA ports to the "virtual VNA ports" of a VNA Extension Kit. This kit enables each NDA port to be terminated with three distinct individual loads or connected to neighboring DUT ports via coupled loads. We derive both a closed-form and a gradient-descent method to estimate the complete scattering matrix of the non-reciprocal DUT from measurements conducted with the $N_\mathrm{A}$-port VNA under various NDA-port terminations. We validate both methods experimentally for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, where our DUT is a complex eight-port transmission-line network comprising circulators. Altogether, the presented "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique constitutes a scalable approach to unambiguously characterize a many-port \textit{non-reciprocal} DUT with a few-port VNA (only $N_\mathrm{A}>1$ is required) -- without any tedious and error-prone manual reconnections susceptible to inaccuracies. The VNA Extension Kit requirements match those for the "Virtual VNA 2.0" technique that was limited to reciprocal DUTs.</p>

            <h2>Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Kezhi Wang, Merouane Debbah</p>
            <p>Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Farajzadeh, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu</p>
            <p>Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.</p>

            <h2>Is fitting error a reliable metric for assessing deformable motion correction in quantitative MRI?</h2>

            <p>Quantitative MR (qMR) can provide numerical values representing the physical and chemical properties of the tissues. To collect a series of frames under varying settings, retrospective motion correction is essential to align the corresponding anatomical points or features. Under the assumption that the misalignment makes the discrepancy between the corresponding features larger, fitting error is a commonly used evaluation metric for motion correction in qMR. This study evaluates the reliability of the fitting error metric in cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) after deformable registration. We found that while fitting error correlates with the negative eigenvalues, the negative Jacobian Determinant increases with broken cardiomyocytes, indicated by helix angle gradient line profiles. Since fitting error measures the distance between moved points and their re-rendered counterparts, the fitting parameter itself may be adjusted due to poor registration. Therefore, fitting error in deformable registration itself is a necessary but not sufficient metric and should be combined with other metrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu He, Saverio Bolognani, Florian Dörfler, Michael Muehlebach</p>
            <p>Distribution shifts have long been regarded as troublesome external forces that a decision-maker should either counteract or conform to. An intriguing feedback phenomenon termed decision dependence arises when the deployed decision affects the environment and alters the data-generating distribution. In the realm of performative prediction, this is encoded by distribution maps parameterized by decisions due to strategic behaviors. In contrast, we formalize an endogenous distribution shift as a feedback process featuring nonlinear dynamics that couple the evolving distribution with the decision. Stochastic optimization in this dynamic regime provides a fertile ground to examine the various roles played by dynamics in the composite problem structure. To this end, we develop an online algorithm that achieves optimal decision-making by both adapting to and shaping the dynamic distribution. Throughout the paper, we adopt a distributional perspective and demonstrate how this view facilitates characterizations of distribution dynamics and the optimality and generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. We showcase the theoretical results in an opinion dynamics context, where an opportunistic party maximizes the affinity of a dynamic polarized population, and in a recommender system scenario, featuring performance optimization with discrete distributions in the probability simplex.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the design strategies for hybrid pole- or trunk-climbing robots, focusing on methods to inform design decisions and assess metrics such as adaptability and performance. A wheeled-grasping hybrid robot with modular, tendon-driven grasping arms and a wheeled drive system mounted on a turret was developed to climb columns of varying diameters. Here, the key innovation is the underactuated arms that can be adjusted to different column sizes by adding or removing modular linkages, though the robot also features capabilities like self-locking (the ability of the robot to stay on the column by friction without power), autonomous grasping, and rotation around the column axis. Mathematical models describe conditions for self-locking and vertical climbing. Experimental results demonstrate the robot's efficacy in climbing and self-locking, validating the proposed models and highlighting the potential for fully automated solutions in industrial applications. This work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and designing hybrid climbing robots, contributing to advancements in autonomous robotics for environments where climbing tall structures is critical.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Mazzieri, Jacopo Pegoraro, Michele Rossi</p>
            <p>The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.</p>

            <p>Given the substantial growth in the use of additive manufacturing in construction (AMC), it is necessary to ensure the quality of printed specimens which can be much more complex than conventionally manufactured parts. This study explores the various aspects of geometry and surface quality control for 3D concrete printing (3DCP), with a particular emphasis on deposition-based methods, namely extrusion and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP). A comprehensive overview of existing quality control (QC) methods and strategies is provided and preceded by an in-depth discussion. Four categories of data capture technologies are investigated and their advantages and limitations in the context of AMC are discussed. Additionally, the effects of environmental conditions and objects' properties on data capture are also analyzed. The study extends to automated data capture planning methods for different sensors. Furthermore, various quality control strategies are explored across different stages of the fabrication cycle of the printed object including: (i) During printing, (ii) Layer-wise, (iii) Preassembly, and (iv) Assembly. In addition to reviewing the methods already applied in AMC, we also address various research gaps and future trends and highlight potential methodologies from adjacent domains that could be transferred to AMC.</p>

            <p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA. Various test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of interference-aware constellations in improving the bit error rate, indicating the adaptability of AE-NOMA to different channel scenarios and its promising potential for implementing NOMA systems</p>

            <p>Predicting clinical outcomes from medical images using quantitative features (``radiomics'') requires many method design choices, Currently, in new clinical applications, finding the optimal radiomics method out of the wide range of methods relies on a manual, heuristic trial-and-error process. We introduce a novel automated framework that optimizes radiomics workflow construction per application by standardizing the radiomics workflow in modular components, including a large collection of algorithms for each component, and formulating a combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem. To solve it, we employ automated machine learning through two strategies (random search and Bayesian optimization) and three ensembling approaches. Results show that a medium-sized random search and straight-forward ensembling perform similar to more advanced methods while being more efficient. Validated across twelve clinical applications, our approach outperforms both a radiomics baseline and human experts. Concluding, our framework improves and streamlines radiomics research by fully automatically optimizing radiomics workflow construction. To facilitate reproducibility, we publicly release six datasets, software of the method, and code to reproduce this study.</p>

            <p>The sixth generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICT). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios, but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To realize this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited, so as to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for five promising technologies enabling 6G, including terahertz (THz), extreme MIMO (E-MIMO), ISAC, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Then, a survey of the progress of the 6G channel research regarding the above five promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. Moreover, a tutorial on the 6G channel simulations is presented. We introduce the BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030, a 6G link-level channel simulator, developed based on the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. The simulator supports the channel simulation of the aforementioned 6G potential technologies. To facilitate the use of the simulator, the tutorial encompasses the design framework, user guidelines, and application examples. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuemei Mao, Gang Wang, Bei Peng, Jiacheng He, Kun Zhang, Song Gao, Jian Chen</p>
            <p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a critical research domain within the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The distributed Kalman filter (DKF) has garnered significant attention as an information fusion method for WSNs. However, effectively handling non-Gaussian environments remains a crucial challenge for DKF. This paper proposes a solution by partitioning the noise distribution into multiple Gaussian components, thereby approximating the measurement model with sub-models. We introduce a model fusion distributed Kalman filter (MFDKF) that combines sub-models by assuming independent random processes for the model's transition probabilities. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the relevant parameters. To address specific requirements in WSNs that demand high consensus or have limited communication, two derivative algorithms, namely consensus MFDKF (C-MFDKF) and simplified MFDKF (S-MFDKF), are proposed based on consensus theory. The convergence of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms is analyzed. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Chen, Nuria González-Prelcic, Takayuki Shimizu, Hongsheng Lu</p>
            <p>One strategy to obtain user location information in a wireless network operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) is based on the exploitation of the geometric relationships between the channel parameters and the user position. These relationships can be built from the line-of-sight (LOS) path and first-order reflections, or purely first-order reflections, requiring high resolution channel estimates to ensure centimeter level accuracy. In this paper, we consider a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing a hybrid architecture, and develop a low complexity two-stage multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) algorithm suitable for accurate estimation of high dimensional channels. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) called PathNet is designed to classify the order of the estimated channel paths, so that only the LOS path and first-order reflections are selected for localization. Next, a 3D localization strategy exploiting the geometry of the environment is developed to operate in both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, while considering the unknown clock offset between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX). Finally, a Transformer based network exploiting attention mechanisms called ChanFormer is proposed to refine the initial position estimate obtained from geometric localization. Simulation results obtained with realistic vehicular channels indicate that localization errors below 28 cm can be achieved for 80% of the users when the LOS path is present, while sub-meter accuracy can be achieved for 55% of the users in NLOS conditions.</p>

            <h2>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iksung Kang, Qinrong Zhang, Stella X. Yu, Na Ji</p>
            <p>Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</p>

            <p>This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cramer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.</p>

            <h2>Convex Hull Prediction Methods for Bitrate Ladder Construction: Design, Evaluation, and Comparison</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Telili, Wassim Hamidouche, Hadi Amirpour, Sid Ahmed Fezza, Luce Morin, Christian Timmerer</p>
            <p>HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) has emerged as a prevalent approach for over-the-top (OTT)video streaming services due to its ability to deliver a seamless user experience. A fundamental component of HAS is the bitrate ladder, which comprises a set of encoding parameters (e.g., bitrate-resolution pairs) used to encode the source video into multiple representations. This adaptive bitrate ladder enables the client's video player to dynamically adjust the quality of the video stream in real-time based on fluctuations in network conditions, ensuring uninterrupted playback by selecting the most suitable representation for the available bandwidth. The most straightforward approach involves using a fixed bitrate ladder for all videos, consisting of pre-determined bitrate-resolution pairs known as one-size-fits-all. Conversely, the most reliable technique relies on intensively encoding all resolutions over a wide range of bitrates to build the convex hull, thereby optimizing the bitrate ladder by selecting the representations from the convex hull for each specific video. Several techniques have been proposed to predict content-based ladders without performing a costly, exhaustive search encoding. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various convex hull prediction methods, including both conventional and learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we conduct a benchmark study of several handcrafted- and deep learning (DL)-based approaches for predicting content-optimized convex hulls across multiple codec settings. The considered methods are evaluated on our proposed large-scale dataset, which includes 300 UHD video shots encoded with software and hardware encoders using three state-of-the-art video standards, including ACV/H.264, HEVC/H.265, and VVC/H.266, at various bitrate points. Our analysis provides valuable insights and establishes baseline performance for future research in this field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Ren, Colin Chen, Hyeontae Sung, Heejin Ahn, Ian Mitchell, Maryam Kamgarpour</p>
            <p>We present a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) framework under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we consider the uncertainty that arises from predicting future behaviors of moving obstacles, which may exhibit multiple modes (for example, turning left or right). To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms in autonomous driving simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti</p>
            <p>We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p>

            <h2>Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shingo Takemoto, Kazuki Naganuma, Shunsuke Ono</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined by the l1-norm of second-order spatio-spectral differences, is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the underlying spatio-spectral properties. However, since SSTV refers only to adjacent pixels/bands, semi-local spatial structures are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, defined using the nuclear norms of matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors for each band in semi-local area (we call these matrices as spatio-spectral structure tensors). The design of this regularization function preserves the semi-local spatial structures and the spectral correlation across all bands while ensuring robust mixed noise removal. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nimrod Shabtay, Eli Schwartz, Raja Giryes</p>
            <p>Phase-coded imaging is a computational imaging method designed to tackle tasks such as passive depth estimation and extended depth of field (EDOF) using depth cues inserted during image capture. Most of the current deep learning-based methods for depth estimation or all-in-focus imaging require a training dataset with high-quality depth maps and an optimal focus point at infinity for all-in-focus images. Such datasets are difficult to create, usually synthetic, and require external graphic programs. We propose a new method named "Deep Phase Coded Image Prior" (DPCIP) for jointly recovering the depth map and all-in-focus image from a coded-phase image using solely the captured image and the optical information of the imaging system. Our approach does not depend on any specific dataset and surpasses prior supervised techniques utilizing the same imaging system. This improvement is achieved through the utilization of a problem formulation based on implicit neural representation (INR) and deep image prior (DIP). Due to our zero-shot method, we overcome the barrier of acquiring accurate ground-truth data of depth maps and all-in-focus images for each new phase-coded system introduced. This allows focusing mainly on developing the imaging system, and not on ground-truth data collection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngoc-Du Tran, Thi-Thao Tran, Quang-Huy Nguyen, Manh-Hung Vu, Van-Truong Pham</p>
            <p>The emergence of deep learning techniques has advanced the image segmentation task, especially for medical images. Many neural network models have been introduced in the last decade bringing the automated segmentation accuracy close to manual segmentation. However, cutting-edge models like Transformer-based architectures rely on large scale annotated training data, and are generally designed with densely consecutive layers in the encoder, decoder, and skip connections resulting in large number of parameters. Additionally, for better performance, they often be pretrained on a larger data, thus requiring large memory size and increasing resource expenses. In this study, we propose a new lightweight but efficient model, namely LiteNeXt, based on convolutions and mixing modules with simplified decoder, for medical image segmentation. The model is trained from scratch with small amount of parameters (0.71M) and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (0.42). To handle boundary fuzzy as well as occlusion or clutter in objects especially in medical image regions, we propose the Marginal Weight Loss that can help effectively determine the marginal boundary between object and background. Additionally, the Self-embedding Representation Parallel technique is proposed as an innovative data augmentation strategy that utilizes the network architecture itself for self-learning augmentation, enhancing feature extraction robustness without external data. Experiments on public datasets including Data Science Bowls, GlaS, ISIC2018, PH2, Sunnybrook, and Lung X-ray data show promising results compared to other state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyi Wang, Angeliki Katsenou, David Bull</p>
            <p>With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild is increasingly evident. UGC is typically acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression (transcoding) before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that employ the original content as a reference are not suitable. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the quality of diverse video content without reference to the original uncompressed videos. ReLaX-VQA uses frame differences to select spatio-temporal fragments intelligently together with different expressions of spatial features associated with the sampled frames. These are then used to better capture spatial and temporal variabilities in the quality of neighbouring frames. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers. Extensive testing across four UGC datasets demonstrates that ReLaX-VQA consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving an average SRCC of 0.8658 and PLCC of 0.8873. Open-source code and trained models that will facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA can be found at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Song, Jiaxiang He, Lijie Yang, Mingtao Feng, Keyan Wang</p>
            <p>Diffusion probabilistic models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, balancing high perceptual quality and low distortion remains challenging in image compression applications. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Uncertainty-Guided image compression approach with wavelet Diffusion (UGDiff). Our approach focuses on high frequency compression via the wavelet transform, since high frequency components are crucial for reconstructing image details. We introduce a wavelet conditional diffusion model for high frequency prediction, followed by a residual codec that compresses and transmits prediction residuals to the decoder. This diffusion prediction-then-residual compression paradigm effectively addresses the low fidelity issue common in direct reconstructions by existing diffusion models. Considering the uncertainty from the random sampling of the diffusion model, we further design an uncertainty-weighted rate-distortion (R-D) loss tailored for residual compression, providing a more rational trade-off between rate and distortion. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of UGDiff, surpassing state-of-the-art image compression methods in R-D performance, perceptual quality, subjective quality, and inference time.

            <h2>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond Diagonal RIS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhao, Hongyu Li, Bruno Clerckx, Massimo Franceschetti</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) in terms of singular values for improved wireless (e.g., rate and power) performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical bounds are derived under popular RIS deployment scenarios to showcase the shaping potentials of BD-RIS on the channel Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. A numerical optimization method is then proposed for a broader range of shaping problems and invoked to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a low-complexity shaping-inspired approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values and the trade-off in manipulating them, resulting in enhanced power gain and achievable rate. Those benefits become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission (hence achieving the asymptotic DoF) at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its singular value shaping proficiency.</p>

            <p>Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we examine necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for infinite-horizon safety verification and reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems, derived through a relaxation of Bellman equations. Unlike previous methods focused on barrier-like conditions that primarily address sufficiency, our work rigorously integrates both necessity and sufficiency for properties pertaining to infinite time. Safety verification aims to certify the satisfaction of the safety property, which stipulates that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, remaining within a safe set always is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. A necessary and sufficient barrier-like condition is formulated for safety verification. In contrast, reach-avoid verification extends beyond safety to include reachability, seeking to certify the satisfaction of the reach-avoid property. It requires that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, reaching a target set eventually while remaining within a safe set until the first hit of the target, is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. Two necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions are formulated under certain assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Subspace Representation Learning for Sparse Linear Arrays to Localize More Sources than Sensors: A Deep Learning Methodology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Lin Chen, Bhaskar D. Rao</p>
            <p>Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.</p>

            <p>Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in industrial and medical imaging, but sparse-view scanning reduces radiation exposure at the cost of incomplete sinograms and challenging reconstruction. Existing RGB-based inpainting models struggle with severe feature entanglement, while sinogram-specific methods often lack explicit physics constraints. We propose FCDM, a physics-guided, frequency-aware sinogram inpainting framework. It integrates bidirectional frequency-domain convolutions to disentangle overlapping features while enforcing total absorption and frequency-domain consistency via a physics-informed loss. To enhance diffusion-based restoration, we introduce a Fourier-enhanced mask embedding to encode angular dependencies and a frequency-adaptive noise scheduling strategy that incorporates a soft row-wise absorption constraint to maintain physical realism. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that FCDM outperforms existing methods, achieving SSIM over 0.95 and PSNR above 30 dB, with up to 33% and 29% improvements over baselines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianao Li, Manxiu Cui, Cheng Ma, Emma Alexander</p>
            <p>Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images using a differentiable physics model to solve the semi-blind inverse problem. The SOS, parametrized by either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF), is updated directly by backpropagation. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in-vivo data.</p>

            <p>Super-Resolution Ultrasound (SRUS) imaging through localising and tracking microbubbles, also known as Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM), has demonstrated significant potential for reconstructing microvasculature and flows with sub-diffraction resolution in clinical diagnostics. However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</p>

            <p>In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</p>

            <p>Previous work indicates evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in brain waste clearance processes, and that altered flow patterns are associated with various diseases of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the distribution in human brain of a gadolinium-based CSF contrast agent (tracer) administered intrathecal. For this, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken at multiple time points before and after injection were utilized. We propose a U-net-based supervised learning model to predict pixel-wise signal increase at its peak after 24 hours. Performance is evaluated based on different tracer distribution stages provided during training, including predictions from baseline scans taken before injection. Our findings show that training with imaging data from only the first two hours post-injection yields tracer flow predictions comparable to models trained with additional later-stage scans. Validation against ventricular reflux gradings from neuroradiologists confirmed alignment with expert evaluations. These results demonstrate that deep learning-based methods for CSF flow prediction deserve more attention, as minimizing MR imaging without compromising clinical analysis could enhance efficiency, improve patient well-being, and lower healthcare costs.</p>

            <p>Uncontrolled cell division in the brain is what gives rise to brain tumors. If the tumor size increases by more than half, there is little hope for the patient's recovery. This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of the brain, a CNN was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this research. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved and we also localized the tumor regions from the unannotated images using GradCAM, a deep learning explainability tool. In order to evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the features into different ML models. CNN and machine learning models were also evaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the CNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the patient.</p>

            <h2>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Strässer, Julian Berberich, Frank Allgöwer</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating Forecasting with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Vladimir Dvorkin, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) is a promising solution to increase the utilization of transmission lines by adjusting ratings based on real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecast at the scheduling stage is thus necessary for system operators to proactively optimize power flows, manage congestion, and reduce the cost of grid operations. However, the DLR forecast remains challenging due to weather uncertainty. To reliably predict DLRs, we propose a new probabilistic forecasting model based on line graph convolutional LSTM. Like standard LSTM networks, our model accounts for temporal correlations between DLRs across the planning horizon. The line graph-structured network additionally allows us to leverage the spatial correlations of DLR features across the grid to improve the quality of predictions. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline probabilistic DLR forecasting models regarding reliability and sharpness while using the fewest parameters.</p>

            <h2>Adversarial Diffusion Compression for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Chen, Gehui Li, Rongyuan Wu, Xindong Zhang, Jie Chen, Jian Zhang, Lei Zhang</p>
            <p>Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex, unknown processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering up to 9.3$\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods.

            <h2>Self-Supervised Diffusion MRI Denoising via Iterative and Stable Refinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenxu Wu, Qingpeng Kong, Zihang Jiang, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), serves as a ``microscope'' for anatomical structures and routinely mitigates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio scans by compromising temporal or spatial resolution. However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

            <h2>Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahshid Shiri, Chandra Bortolotto, Alessandro Bruno, Alessio Consonni, Daniela Maria Grasso, Leonardo Brizzi, Daniele Loiacono, Lorenzo Preda</p>
            <p>Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.</p>

            <p>We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a small amount of works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a foundational universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves cross-modality retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work to study retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.</p>

The results show that the number of DoFs is proportional to the transmit and receive aperture sizes and inversely proportional to the propagation distance. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the properties of EM DoFs in CAPA-based channels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adnan Iltaf, Rayan Merghani Ahmed, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou</p>
            <p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Binucci, Osvaldo Simeone, Paolo Banelli</p>
            <p>This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</p>

            <h2>A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunian Pan, Jun Li, Lifan Xu, Shunqiao Sun, Quanyan Zhu</p>
            <p>Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.</p>

            <p>The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is widely employed in angiogenesis research, and distribution of growing blood vessels is the key evaluation indicator. As a result, vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative assessment based on topology and morphology. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to its subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms remains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between CAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to perform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate intermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate Domain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle cross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily concentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate domain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method outperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in UDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuhang Yang, Puguang An, Peng Yang, Xianbin Cao, Dapeng Oliver Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
            <p>To tackle the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper introduces an innovative SnS near-field CE framework grounded in adaptive subarray partitioning. Conventional methods relying on equal subarray partitioning often lead to suboptimal divisions, undermining CE precision. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive subarray segmentation approach. First, we develop a spherical-wave channel model customized for line-of-sight (LoS) XL-MIMO systems to capture SnS traits. Next, we define and evaluate the adverse effects of over-segmentation and under-segmentation on CE efficacy. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which merges cost-effective power measurements with a DHBF structure, enabling joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A robust partitioning algorithm, termed power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS), exploits statistical features of power profiles, while the DHBF utilizes subarray segmentation-based group time block code (SS-GTBC) to enable efficient subarray decoupling with limited radio frequency (RF) chain resources. Additionally, by utilizing angular-domain block sparsity and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV), employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks to lower complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the exceptional performance of the proposed framework over its counterparts.</p>

            <p>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.</p>

            <p>Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadav Cohen, Itzik Klein</p>
            <p>The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.</p>

            <p>We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</p>

            <p>Sound content creation, essential for multimedia works such as video games and films, often involves extensive trial-and-error, enabling creators to semantically reflect their artistic ideas and inspirations, which evolve throughout the creation process, into the sound. Recent high-quality diffusion-based Text-to-Sound (T2S) generative models provide valuable tools for creators. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds, imposing an undesirable burden that hinders the trial-and-error process. While existing T2S distillation models address this limitation through 1-step generation, the sample quality of $1$-step generation remains insufficient for production use. Additionally, while multi-step sampling in those distillation models improves sample quality itself, the semantic content changes due to their lack of deterministic sampling capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM), which allow flexible transitions between high-quality $1$-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step deterministic sampling. This allows creators to efficiently conduct trial-and-error with 1-step generation to semantically align samples with their intention, and subsequently refine sample quality with preserving semantic content through deterministic multi-step sampling. To develop SoundCTM, we reframe the CTM training framework, originally proposed in computer vision, and introduce a novel feature distance using the teacher network for a distillation loss. For production-level generation, we scale up our model to 1B trainable parameters, making SoundCTM-DiT-1B the first large-scale distillation model in the sound community to achieve both promising high-quality 1-step and multi-step full-band (44.1kHz) generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Tessari, Kunpeng Yao, Neville Hogan</p>
            <p>Advances in computational power and hardware efficiency have enabled tackling increasingly complex, high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieves remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis. Metrics such as cosine similarity are often used, for example in the development of natural language processing algorithms or recommender systems. However, the interpretability of such metrics diminishes as dimensions increase. This paper analyzes the effects of dimensionality, revealing significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimension of vectors, leading to biased and poorly interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce a Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. An example of the advantages of DIEM over cosine similarity is reported for a large language model application. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ce Wang, Zhenyu Hu, Wanjie Sun, Zhenzhong Chen</p>
            <p>Image rescaling aims to learn the optimal low-resolution (LR) image that can be accurately reconstructed to its original high-resolution (HR) counterpart, providing an efficient image processing and storage method for ultra-high definition media. However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges to the upscaling process due to its highly ill-posed nature, causing existing image rescaling methods to struggle in generating semantically correct structures and perceptual friendly textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM) for extreme image rescaling, which performs rescaling operations in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder and effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, TADM adopts a pseudo-invertible module to establish the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. Then, the rescaled latent features are enhanced by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful details. Considering the spatially non-uniform degradation caused by the rescaling operation, we propose a novel time-step alignment strategy, which can adaptively allocate the generative capacity of the diffusion model based on the quality of the reconstructed latent features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TADM over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p>

With the advancing capability of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer private details from widely available human-centric data (e.g., social media), it is crucial to investigate whether AI can accurately extract private occupational information from such data. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks can classify individuals as entrepreneurs with high accuracy based on facial images sourced from Crunchbase, a premier source for entrepreneurship data. Utilizing a dataset comprising facial images of 40,728 individuals, including both entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a contrastive learning approach based on pairs of facial images (one entrepreneur and one non-entrepreneur per pair). While human experts (n=650) and trained participants (n=133) were unable to classify entrepreneurs with accuracy above chance levels (>50%), our AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 79.51%. Several robustness tests indicate that this high level of accuracy is maintained under various conditions. These results indicate privacy risks for entrepreneurs.</p>

            <h2>Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Liu, M. A. S. Kolarijani</p>
            <p>In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem Dementyev, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Scott Wisdom, Navin Chatlani, John R. Hershey, Richard F.Lyon</p>
            <p>Low latency models are critical for real-time speech enhancement applications, such as hearing aids and hearables. However, the sub-millisecond latency space for resource-constrained hearables remains underexplored. We demonstrate speech enhancement using a computationally efficient minimum-phase FIR filter, enabling sample-by-sample processing to achieve mean algorithmic latency of 0.32 ms to 1.25 ms. With a single microphone, we observe a mean SI-SDRi of 4.1 dB. The approach shows generalization with a DNSMOS increase of 0.2 on unseen audio recordings. We use a lightweight LSTM-based model of 626k parameters to generate FIR taps. Using a real hardware implementation on a low-power DSP, our system can run with 376 MIPS and a mean end-to-end latency of 3.35 ms. In addition, we provide a comparison with existing low-latency spectral masking techniques. We hope this work will enable a better understanding of latency and can be used to improve the comfort and usability of hearables.</p>

            <p>Animal vocalization denoising is a task similar to human speech enhancement, which is relatively well-studied. In contrast to the latter, it comprises a higher diversity of sound production mechanisms and recording environments, and this higher diversity is a challenge for existing models. Adding to the challenge and in contrast to speech, we lack large and diverse datasets comprising clean vocalizations. As a solution we use as training data pseudo-clean targets, i.e. pre-denoised vocalizations, and segments of background noise without a vocalization. We propose a train set derived from bioacoustics datasets and repositories representing diverse species, acoustic environments, geographic regions. Additionally, we introduce a non-overlapping benchmark set comprising clean vocalizations from different taxa and noise samples. We show that that denoising models (demucs, CleanUNet) trained on pseudo-clean targets obtained with speech enhancement models achieve competitive results on the benchmarking set.

            <h2>Hierarchical Uncertainty Estimation for Learning-based Registration in Neuroimaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoling Hu, Karthik Gopinath, Peirong Liu, Malte Hoffmann, Koen Van Leemput, Oula Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias</p>
            <p>Over recent years, deep learning based image registration has achieved impressive accuracy in many domains, including medical imaging and, specifically, human neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the uncertainty estimation associated with these methods has been largely limited to the application of generic techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) that do not exploit the peculiarities of the problem domain, particularly spatial modeling. Here, we propose a principled way to propagate uncertainties (epistemic or aleatoric) estimated at the level of spatial location by these methods, to the level of global transformation models, and further to downstream tasks. Specifically, we justify the choice of a Gaussian distribution for the local uncertainty modeling, and then propose a framework where uncertainties spread across hierarchical levels, depending on the choice of transformation model. Experiments on publicly available data sets show that Monte Carlo dropout correlates very poorly with the reference registration error, whereas our uncertainty estimates correlate much better. Crucially, the results also show that uncertainty-aware fitting of transformations improves the registration accuracy of brain MRI scans. Finally, we illustrate how sampling from the posterior distribution of the transformations can be used to propagate uncertainties to downstream neuroimaging tasks.

            <p>Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) can transform the way clinical medicine is delivered by overcoming privacy barriers that currently render clinical data sharing difficult. This is the key to accelerating the development of digital tools contributing to enhanced patient safety. Such tools include robust data-driven clinical decision support systems, and example-based digital training tools that will enable healthcare professionals to improve their diagnostic performance for enhanced patient safety. This study focuses on the clinical evaluation of medical SDG, with a proof-of-concept investigation on diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. Its scientific contributions include a) a novel protocol for the systematic Clinical Evaluation of Medical Image Synthesis (CEMIS); b) a novel variational autoencoder-based model for the generation of high-resolution synthetic WCE images; and c) a comprehensive evaluation of the synthetic images using the CEMIS protocol by 10 international WCE specialists, in terms of image quality, diversity, and realism, as well as their utility for clinical decision-making. The results show that TIDE-II generates clinically plausible, very realistic WCE images, of improved quality compared to relevant state-of-the-art generative models. Concludingly, CEMIS can serve as a reference for future research on medical image-generation techniques, while the adaptation/extension of the architecture of TIDE-II to other imaging domains can be promising.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ebrahim Farahmand, Shovito Barua Soumma, Nooshin Taheri Chatrudi, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
            <p>The availability of continuous glucose monitors as over-the-counter commodities have created a unique opportunity to monitor a person's blood glucose levels, forecast blood glucose trajectories and provide automated interventions to prevent devastating chronic complications that arise from poor glucose control. However, forecasting blood glucose levels is challenging because blood glucose changes consistently in response to food intake, medication intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress. It is particularly difficult to accurately predict BGL from multimodal and irregularly sampled data and over long prediction horizons. Furthermore, these forecasting models must operate in real-time on edge devices to provide in-the-moment interventions. To address these challenges, we propose GlucoNet, an AI-powered sensor system for continuously monitoring behavioral and physiological health and robust forecasting of blood glucose patterns. GlucoNet devises a feature decomposition-based transformer model that incorporates patients' behavioral and physiological data and transforms sparse and irregular patient data (e.g., diet and medication intake data) into continuous features using a mathematical model, facilitating better integration with the BGL data. Given the non-linear and non-stationary nature of BG signals, we propose a decomposition method to extract both low and high-frequency components from the BGL signals, thus providing accurate forecasting. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose to employ knowledge distillation to compress the transformer model. GlucoNet achieves a 60% improvement in RMSE and a 21% reduction in the number of parameters, improving RMSE and MAE by 51% and 57%, using data obtained involving 12 participants with T1-Diabetes. These results underscore GlucoNet's potential as a compact and reliable tool for real-world diabetes prevention and management.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeonghyeok Do, Jaehyup Lee, Munchurl Kim</p>
            <p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides robust environmental and temporal coverage (e.g., during clouds, seasons, day-night cycles), yet its noise and unique structural patterns pose interpretation challenges, especially for non-experts. SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.</p>

            <p>Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Guo, Heng Wang, Jianbo Ma, Weidong Cai</p>
            <p>Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. By addressing V2A generation at the sound-source level, SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance as evidenced by extensive experiments. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our generation can be tried and heard at this https URL .</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixin Zhang, Nicholas Konz, Kevin Kramer, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
            <p>Image segmentation foundation models (SFMs) like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive zero-shot and interactive segmentation across diverse domains. However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (e.g., SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We link these failures to "textural confusion", where models misinterpret local structure as global texture, causing over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a learning-based approach for centralized position control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian (MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively establishing a task-free controller.</p>

            <p>3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce advances in the sensor suite of an autonomous flying insect robot (FIR) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been notable advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</p>

            <p>Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion this http URL samples are available at: this https URL.</p>

            <p>We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies.

            <p>Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.</p>

            <h2>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design the controller, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions that we then enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed solution can be verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with a recent droop control algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash J. Khabbazi, Elias N. Pergantis, Levi D. Reyes Premer, Panagiotis Papageorgiou, Alex H. Lee, James E. Braun, Gregor P. Henze, Kevin J. Kircher</p>
            <p>A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. This paper reviews 24 field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</p>

            <h2>Community Energy Management System for Fast Frequency Response: A Hierarchical Control Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonsung Jung, Hyunjoong Kim, Hyunghwan Shin, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>The increase in renewable energy sources (RES) has reduced power system inertia, making frequency stabilization more challenging and highlighting the need for fast frequency response (FFR) resources. While building energy management systems (BEMS) equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs) can provide FFR, individual BEMS alone cannot fully meet demand. To address this, we propose a community energy management system (CEMS) operational model that minimizes energy costs and generates additional revenue, which is provided FFR through coordinated DERs and building loads under photovoltaic (PV) generation uncertainty. The model incorporates a hierarchical control framework with three levels: Level 1 allocates maximum FFR capacity, Level 2 employs scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to adjust DER operations and ensure FFR provision despite PV uncertainties, and Level 3 performs rapid load adjustments in response to frequency fluctuations detected by a frequency meter. Simulation results on a campus building cluster demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving a 10\% reduction in energy costs and a 24\% increase in FFR capacity, all while maintaining occupant comfort and enhancing frequency stabilization.</p>

            <h2>A Risk-aware Bi-level Bidding Strategy for Virtual Power Plant with Power-to-Hydrogen System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaehyun Yoo, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>This paper presents a risk-aware bi-level bidding strategy for Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that integrates Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) system, addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy variability and market volatility. By incorporating Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) within the bi-level optimization framework, the proposed strategy enables VPPs to mitigate financial risks associated with uncertain market conditions. The upper-level problem seeks to maximize revenue through optimal bidding, while the lower-level problem ensures market-clearing compliance. The integration of the P2H system allows surplus renewable energy to be stored as hydrogen, which is utilized as an energy carrier, thereby increasing market profitability and enhancing resilience against financial risks. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through a modified IEEE 14 bus system, demonstrating that the inclusion of the P2H system and CVaR-based risk aversion enhances both revenue and financial hedging capability under volatile market this http URL paper underscores the strategic role of hydrogen storage in VPP operations, contributing to supporting improved profitability and the efficacy of a risk-aware bidding strategy.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven Decision Making for Enhancing Small-Signal Stability in Hybrid AC/DC Grids Through Converter Control Role Assignment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Rossi, Sergi Costa Dilme, Josep Arevalo-Soler, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt</p>
            <p>Hybrid AC/DC transmission grids incorporate Modular Multilevel Converters functioning as Interconnecting Power Converters (IPCs). The control role assigned to each converter significantly influences grid dynamics. Traditionally, these converters operate with static control roles, but recent studies have proposed scheduling their roles based on day-ahead forecasts to enhance stability performance. However, in systems with high renewable energy penetration, forecast deviations can render scheduled control assignments suboptimal or even lead to instability. To address this challenge, this work proposes an online scheduling recalculation algorithm that dynamically adapts IPC control roles during system operation. The approach leverages a data-driven multi-criteria decision-making framework, integrating surrogate models of conventional small-signal stability analysis tools to enable a fast computation of system stability and stability performance indicators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler, Steven Low</p>
            <p>We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel R. Bayer, Felix Haag, Marco Pruckner, Konstantin Hopf</p>
            <p>Short-term forecasting of residential electricity demand is an important task for utilities. Yet, many small and medium-sized utilities still use simple forecasting approaches such as Synthesized Load Profiles, which treat residential households similarly and neither account for renewable energy installations nor novel large consumers (e.g., heat pumps, electric vehicles). The effectiveness of such "one-fits-all" approaches in future grid states--where decentral generation and sector coupling increases--are questionable. Our study challenges these forecasting practices and investigates whether Machine Learning (ML) approaches are suited to predict electricity demand in today's and in future grid states. We use real smart meter data from 3,511 households in Germany over 34 months. We extrapolate this data with future grid states (i.e., increased decentral generation and storage) based on a digital twin of a local energy system. Our results show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approaches outperform SLPs as well as simple benchmark estimators with up to 68.5% lower Root Mean Squared Error for a day-ahead forecast, especially in future grid states. Nevertheless, all prediction approaches perform worse in future grid states. Our findings therefore reinforce the need (a) for utilities and grid operators to employ ML approaches instead of traditional demand prediction methods in future grid states and (b) to prepare current ML methods for future grid states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyue Zheng, Linglong Dai</p>
            <p>The advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Particularly, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization of AI in different physical-layer (PHY) tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse PHY tasks requires extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task PHY network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM, by exploiting the excellent semantic understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish different tasks. The proposed design allows different wireless data types to be well aligned with the LLM input format. Moreover, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is utilized for LLM fine-tuning. To reduce the memory requirement during LLM fine-tuning, a LoRA fine-tuning-aware quantization method is introduced. Extensive numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Modal Variable-Rate CSI Reconstruction for FDD Massive MIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunseo Nam, Jiwook Choi</p>
            <p>In frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, acquiring channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) traditionally relies on limited feedback from mobile terminals (MTs). However, the accuracy of channel reconstruction from feedback CSI is inherently constrained by the rate-distortion trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-modal channel reconstruction framework that leverages auxiliary data, such as RGB images or uplink CSI, collected at the BS. By integrating contextual information from these modalities, the framework mitigates CSI distortions caused by noise, compression, and quantization. At its core, the framework utilizes an autoencoder network capable of generating variable-length CSI, tailored for rate-adaptive multi-modal channel reconstruction. By augmenting the foundational autoencoder network using a transfer learning-based multi-modal fusion strategy, we enable accurate channel reconstruction in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. To train and evaluate the network under diverse and realistic wireless conditions, we construct a synthetic dataset that pairs wireless channel data with sensor data through 3D modeling and ray tracing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in 5G New Radio (5G NR)-compliant scenarios, highlighting the potential of sensor data integration to improve CSI reconstruction accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Proactive Robust Hardening of Resilient Power Distribution Network: Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Modeling and Fast Solution Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donglai Ma, Xiaoyu Cao, Bo Zeng, Qing-Shan Jia, Chen Chen, Qiaozhu Zhai, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>To address the power system hardening problem, traditional approaches often adopt robust optimization (RO) that considers a fixed set of concerned contingencies, regardless of the fact that hardening some components actually renders relevant contingencies impractical. In this paper, we directly adopt a dynamic uncertainty set that explicitly incorporates the impact of hardening decisions on the worst-case contingencies, which leads to a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Then, a DDU-based robust-stochastic optimization (DDU-RSO) model is proposed to support the hardening decisions on distribution lines and distributed generators (DGs). Also, the randomness of load variations and available storage levels is considered through stochastic programming (SP) in the innermost level problem. Various corrective measures (e.g., the joint scheduling of DGs and energy storage) are included, coupling with a finite support of stochastic scenarios, for resilience enhancement. To relieve the computation burden of this new hardening formulation, an enhanced customization of parametric column-and-constraint generation (P-C&CG) algorithm is developed. By leveraging the network structural information, the enhancement strategies based on resilience importance indices are designed to improve the convergence performance. Numerical results on 33-bus and 118-bus test distribution networks have demonstrated the effectiveness of DDU-RSO aided hardening scheme. Furthermore, in comparison to existing solution methods, the enhanced P-C&CG has achieved a superior performance by reducing the solution time by a few orders of magnitudes.</p>

            <h2>Grid-Aware Islanding and Resynchronisation of AC/DC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Willem Lambrichts, Jules Mace, Drazen Dujic, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an optimal, grid-aware control framework for the islanding, island-operation and resynchronisation of hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The optimal control framework is based on a formally derived linearized load-flow model for multiterminal hybrid AC/DC networks. The load flow model integrates the AC grid, DC grid, and interfacing converters (IC) into a unified representation. This work extends an existing load flow model to include the ICs' grid-forming operation. In traditional islanding control frameworks, the grid-forming converter is typically interfaced with an energy storage system that can provide bidirectional power to maintain the power balance. The proposed framework, however, allows the ICs to operate as the grid-forming unit while being connected to a DC grid rather than a single resource. This configuration allows for a wider operating range and, thus, a more flexible control. Furthermore, the optimal grid-aware control framework can steer the system to ensure a feasible operation without any grid constraint violations before, during, and after the islanding manoeuvre. The framework also guarantees smooth transitions, i.e., without any significant transient behaviour, when transitioning between grid-connected and islanding operations. The optimal control framework is experimentally validated on a 27-bus hybrid AC/DC network consisting of 3 ICs that interface the AC and DC networks. The hybrid grid hosts various controllable and stochastic resources.</p>

            <h2>An Extended State Space Model of Aggregated Electric Vehicles for Flexibility Estimation and Power Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiping Liu, Xiaozhe Wang, Geza Joos</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) can provide substantial electricity to the grid, supporting the grids' stability. The state space model (SSM) has been proposed as an effective modeling method for power prediction and centralized control of aggregated EVs, offering low communication requirements and computational complexity. However, the SSM may overlook specific scenarios, leading to significant prediction and control inaccuracies. This paper proposes an extended state space model (eSSM) for aggregated EVs and develops associated control strategies. By accounting for the limited flexibility of fully charged and discharged EVs, the eSSM more accurately captures the state transition dynamics of EVs in various states of charge (SOC). Comprehensive simulations show that the eSSM will provide more accurate predictions of the flexibility and power trajectories of aggregated EVs, and more effectively tracks real-time power references compared to the conventional SSM method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Liao, Wei Guo, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology for future wireless networks, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) through the dynamic configuration of antennas in response to propagation environment variations. The integration of fluid antennas (FAs) with multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks promises substantial weighted sum rate (WSR) gains via joint beamforming and FA position optimization. However, the joint design is challenging due to the strong coupling between beamforming matrices and antenna positions. To address the challenge, we propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method in FA-assisted MU-MIMO networks. Specifically, we first employ matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we solve the reformulated problem following the BCA principle, where we develop a low-complexity majorization maximization algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simultaneously. To further reduce the computational, storage, and interconnection costs, we propose a decentralized implementation for our proposed algorithm by utilizing the decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that with our proposed algorithm, the FA-assisted MU-MIMO system achieves up to a 47% WSR improvement over conventional MIMO networks equipped with fixed-position antennas. Moreover, the decentralized implementation reduces computation time by approximately 70% and has similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.</p>

However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a systematic approach to detecting High Impedance Faults (HIFs) in medium voltage distribution networks using recurrence plots and machine learning. We first simulate 1150 internal faults, including 300 HIFs, 1000 external faults, and 40 normal conditions using the PSCAD/EMTDC software. Key features are extracted from the 3-phase differential currents using wavelet coefficients, which are then converted into recurrence matrices. A multi-stage classification framework is employed, where the first classification stage identifies internal faults, and the second stage distinguishes HIFs from other internal faults. The framework is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Tree-based classifiers, particularly Random Forest and Decision Tree, achieve superior performance, with 99.24% accuracy in the first stage and 98.26% in the second. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating recurrence analysis with machine learning for fault detection in power distribution networks.</p>

            <p>The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to US emissions and the second largest globally. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to represent half of global car sales by 2035, emerging as a pivotal solution to reduce emissions and enhance grid flexibility. The electrification of buildings, manufacturing, and transportation is expected to grow electricity demand substantially over the next decade. Without effectively managed EV charging, EVs could strain energy grid infrastructure and increase electricity costs. Drawing on de-identified 2023 EV telematics data from Rivian Automotive, this study found that 72% of home charging commenced after the customer plugged in their vehicle regardless of utility time of use (TOU) tariffs or managed charging programs. In fewer than 26% of charging sessions in the sample, EV owners actively scheduled charging times to align or participate in utility tariffs or programs. With a majority of drivers concurrently plugged in during optimal charging periods yet not actively charging, the study identified an opportunity to reduce individual EV owner costs and carbon emissions through smarter charging habits without significant behavioral modifications or sacrifice in user preferences. By optimizing home charging schedules within existing plug-in and plug-out windows, the study suggests that EV owners can save an average of $140 annually and reduce the associated carbon emissions of charging their EV by as much as 28%.</p>

            <p>The flexible loads in power systems, such as interruptible and transferable loads, are critical flexibility resources for mitigating power imbalances. Despite their potential, accurate modeling of these loads is a challenging work and has not received enough attention, limiting their integration into operational frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper develops a data-driven identification theory and algorithm for price-responsive flexible loads (PRFLs). First, we introduce PRFL models that capture both static and dynamic decision mechanisms governing their response to electricity price variations. Second, We develop a data-driven identification framework that explicitly incorporates forecast and measurement errors. Particularly, we give a theoretical analysis to quantify the statistical impact of such noise on parameter estimation. Third, leveraging the bilevel structure of the identification problem, we propose a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm that features the scalability to large sample sizes and the ability to offer posterior differentiability certificates as byproducts. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p>Power allocation is an important task in wireless communication networks. Classical optimization algorithms and deep learning methods, while effective in small and static scenarios, become either computationally demanding or unsuitable for large and dynamic networks with varying user loads. This letter explores the potential of transformer-based deep learning models to address these challenges. We propose a transformer neural network to jointly predict optimal uplink and downlink power using only user and access point positions. The max-min fairness problem in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output systems is considered. Numerical results show that the trained model provides near-optimal performance and adapts to varying numbers of users and access points without retraining, additional processing, or updating its neural network architecture. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving robust and flexible power allocation for dynamic networks.</p>

            <p>Solar and wind power are cost-competitive with fossil fuels, yet their intermittent nature presents challenges. Significant temporal and geographic differences in land, wind, and solar resources suggest that long-distance transmission could be particularly beneficial. Using a detailed, open-source model, we analyze optimal transmission expansion jointly with storage, generation, and hourly operations across the three primary interconnects in the United States. Transmission expansion offers far more benefits in a high-renewable system than in a system with mostly conventional generation. Yet while an optimal nationwide plan would have more than triple current interregional transmission, transmission decreases the cost of a 100% clean system by only 7% compared to a plan that relies solely on current transmission. Expanding capacity only within existing interconnects can achieve most of these savings. Adjustments to energy storage and generation mix can leverage the current interregional transmission infrastructure to build a clean power system at a reasonable cost.</p>

            <p>Machine learning and optimisation techniques (MLOPT) hold significant potential to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial systems by enabling data-driven operational improvements. However, the practical application of MLOPT in industrial settings is often hindered by a lack of domain compliance and system-specific consistency, resulting in suboptimal solutions with limited real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop (HITL) constraint-based optimisation framework that integrates domain expertise with data-driven methods, ensuring solutions are both technically sound and operationally feasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through a case study focused on enhancing the thermal efficiency and reducing the turbine heat rate of a 660 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant. By embedding domain knowledge as constraints within the optimisation process, our approach yields solutions that align with the plant's operational patterns and are seamlessly integrated into its control systems. Empirical validation confirms a mean improvement in thermal efficiency of 0.64\% and a mean reduction in turbine heat rate of 93 kJ/kWh. Scaling our analysis to 59 global coal power plants with comparable capacity and fuel type, we estimate a cumulative lifetime reduction of 156.4 million tons of carbon emissions. These results underscore the transformative potential of our HITL-MLOPT framework in delivering domain-compliant, implementable solutions for industrial decarbonisation, offering a scalable pathway to mitigate the environmental impact of coal-based power generation worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Wireless Networks: Deployment Architectures, Key Solutions, and Field Trials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingqing Wu, Guangji Chen, Qiaoyan Peng, Wen Chen, Yifei Yuan, Zhenqiao Cheng, Jianwu Dou, Zhiyong Zhao, Ping Li</p>
            <p>Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a transformative technology for wireless networks by improving coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency through intelligent manipulation of wireless propagation environments. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the deployment and coordination of IRSs for wireless networks. By addressing both single- and multi-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies across diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the trade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming gain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection case, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element allocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper further discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including environmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations. Numerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided wireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements. Lastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field deployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future investigations.</p>

            <h2>Minimum Data Rate Maximization for Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sotiris A. Tegos, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Zhiguo Ding, George K. Karagiannidis</p>
            <p>This paper addresses, for the first time, the uplink performance optimization of multi-user pinching-antenna (PA) systems, recently developed for next-generation wireless networks. By leveraging the unique capabilities of PAs to dynamically configure wireless channels, we focus on maximizing the minimum achievable data rate between devices to achieve a balanced trade-off between throughput and fairness. An effective approach is proposed that separately optimizes the positions of the PAs and the resource allocation. The antenna positioning problem is reformulated into a convex one, while a closed-form solution is provided for the resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the investigated system using the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts, emphasizing the significant potential of PA systems for robust and efficient uplink communication in next-generation wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Transition pathways to electrified chemical production within sector-coupled national energy systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patricia Mayer, Florian Joseph Baader, David Yang Shu, Ludger Leenders, Christian Zibunas, Stefano Moret, André Bardow</p>
            <p>The chemical industry's transition to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is particularly challenging due to the carbon inherently contained in chemical products, eventually released to the environment. Fossil feedstock-based production can be replaced by electrified chemical production, combining carbon capture and utilization (CCU) with electrolysis-based hydrogen. However, electrified chemical production requires vast amounts of clean electricity, leading to competition in our sector-coupled energy systems. In this work, we investigate the pathway of the chemical industry towards electrified production within the context of a sector-coupled national energy system's transition to net-zero emissions. Our results show that the sectors for electricity, low-temperature heat, and mobility transition before the chemical industry due to the required build-up of renewables, and to the higher emissions abatement of heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. To achieve the net-zero target, the energy system relies on clean energy imports to cover 41\% of its electricity needs, largely driven by the high energy requirements of a fully electrified chemical industry. Nonetheless, a partially electrified industry combined with dispatchable production alternatives provides flexibility to the energy system by enabling electrified production when renewable electricity is available. Hence, a partially electrified, diversified chemical industry can support the integration of intermittent renewables, serving as a valuable component in net-zero energy systems.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Active Distribution Systems Using a Stochastic Hybrid Systems Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erfan Mehdipour Abadi, Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a distributed contingency detection algorithm for detecting unobservable contingencies in power distribution systems using stochastic hybrid system (SHS) models. We aim to tackle the challenge of limited measurement capabilities in distribution networks that restrict the ability to detect contingencies promptly. We incorporate the dynamics of distribution network connections, load feeders, PV, and battery energy storage system (BESS) hybrid resources into a fully correlated SHS model representing the distribution system as a randomly switching system between different structures during contingency occurrence. We show that jumps in the SHS model correspond to contingencies in the physical power grid. We propose a probing approach based on magnitude-modulation inputs (MaMI) to make contingencies detectable. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations on a sample distribution system.</p>

            <h2>Rethinking Static Line Rating for Economic and Efficient Power Operation in South Korea</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junseon Park, Junhyun Lee, Hyeongon Park</p>
            <p>In South Korea, power grid is currently operated based on the static line rating (SLR) method, where the transmission line capacity is determined based on extreme weather conditions. However, with global warming, there is a concern that the temperatures during summer may exceed the SLR criteria, posing safety risks. On the other hand, the conservative estimates used for winter conditions limit the utilization of renewable energy. Proposals to install new lines face significant financial and environmental hurdles, complicating efforts to adapt to these changing conditions. Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) offers a real-time solution but requires extensive weather monitoring and complex integration. This paper proposes a novel method that improves on SLR by analyzing historical data to refine line rating criteria on a monthly, seasonal, and semi-annual basis. Through simulations, we show our approach significantly enhances cost effectiveness and reliability of the power system, achieving efficiencies close to DLR with existing infrastructure. This method offers a practical alternative to overcome the limitations of SLR and the implementation challenges of DLR.</p>

            <h2>Closed-loop model-predictive wind farm flow control under time-varying inflow using FLORIDyn</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Becker, Maarten J. van den Broek, Dries Allaerts, Jan-Willem van Wingerden</p>
            <p>Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven by the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually controlled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an open-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up precomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the other hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set points online, which makes them more flexible and resilient. This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller using the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated by a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter to continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel optimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to maximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table industry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without using a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying conditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4 % with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased measurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy control baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table controllers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to disturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free conditions.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Sampling and Sensitivity Analysis of Rare Transient Instability Events via Subset Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyu Liu, Xiaoting Wang, Xiaozhe Wang</p>
            <p>Assessing the risk of low-probability high-impact transient instability (TI) events is crucial for ensuring robust and stable power system operation under high uncertainty. However, direct Monte Carlo (DMC) simulation for rare TI event sampling is computationally intensive. This paper proposes a subset simulation-based method for efficient small TI probability estimation, rare TI events sampling, and subsequent sensitivity analysis. Numerical studies on the modified WSCC 9-bus system demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method over DMC. Additionally, targeted stability enhancement strategies are designed to eliminate rare TI events and enhance the system's robustness to specific transient faults.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Management for Large-Scale Battery Energy Storage Systems via Bayesian Inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Farakhor, Iman Askari, Di Wu, Yebin Wang, Huazhen Fang</p>
            <p>Large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) have found ever-increasing use across industry and society to accelerate clean energy transition and improve energy supply reliability and resilience. However, their optimal power management poses significant challenges: the underlying high-dimensional nonlinear nonconvex optimization lacks computational tractability in real-world implementation, and the uncertainty of the exogenous power demand makes exact optimization difficult. This paper presents a new solution framework to address these bottlenecks. The solution pivots on introducing power-sharing ratios to specify each cell's power quota from the output power demand. To find the optimal power-sharing ratios, we formulate a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem to achieve power-loss-minimizing BESS operation while complying with safety, cell balancing, and power supply-demand constraints. We then propose a parameterized control policy for the power-sharing ratios, which utilizes only three parameters, to reduce the computational demand in solving the NMPC problem. This policy parameterization allows us to translate the NMPC problem into a Bayesian inference problem for the sake of 1) computational tractability, and 2) overcoming the nonconvexity of the optimization problem. We leverage the ensemble Kalman inversion technique to solve the parameter estimation problem. Concurrently, a low-level control loop is developed to seamlessly integrate our proposed approach with the BESS to ensure practical implementation. This low-level controller receives the optimal power-sharing ratios, generates output power references for the cells, and maintains a balance between power supply and demand despite uncertainty in output power. We conduct extensive simulations and experiments on a 20-cell prototype to validate the proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Graph Neural Networks for Fast Contingency Analysis of Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agnes M. Nakiganda, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
            <p>The successful integration of machine learning models into decision support tools for grid operation hinges on effectively capturing the topological changes in daily operations. Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative Maximum Likelihood Target Position Estimation for MIMO-ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Pucci, Tommaso Bacchielli, Andrea Giorgetti</p>
            <p>This letter investigates target position estimation in integrated sensing and communication networks composed of multiple cooperating monostatic base stations (BSs). Each BS employs a MIMO-orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) scheme, enabling the coexistence of communication and sensing. A general cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) framework is derived, directly estimating the target position in a common reference system rather than relying on local range and angle estimates at each BS. Positioning accuracy is evaluated in single-target scenarios by varying the number of collaborating BSs, using root mean square error (RMSE), and comparing against the square root of the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Numerical results demonstrate that the ML framework significantly reduces the position RMSE as the number of cooperating BSs increases.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Probabilistic Assessment of Power System Resilience Using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion Method with Enhanced Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aidan Gerkis, Xiaozhe Wang</p>
            <p>Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events motivates the assessment of power system resilience. The random nature of power system failures during these events mandates probabilistic resilience assessment, but state-of-the-art methods are computationally inefficient. In this paper, an enhanced PCE method to quantify power system resilience based on the extended AC Cascading Failure Model (AC-CFM) model is proposed. To address repeatability issues arising from PCE computation with different sample sets, we propose a novel experiment design method. Numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system illustrate the improved repeatability and convergence of the method. The enhanced PCE method is then used to efficiently assess the system's resilience and propose adaptation measures.</p>

            <h2>A Multi-Sensor Fusion Approach for Rapid Orthoimage Generation in Large-Scale UAV Mapping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialei He, Zhihao Zhan, Zhituo Tu, Xiang Zhu, Jie Yuan</p>
            <p>Rapid generation of large-scale orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been a long-standing focus of research in the field of aerial mapping. A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate feature matching orthoimage generation in a short time. The proposed drone system effectively aids in farmland detection and management.</p>

            <h2>Fluid Antenna Enabled Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Joint Optimization of Positioning, Beamforming, and User Selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhao, Minrui Xu, Ping Wang, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) effectively utilizes communication bandwidth, yet it is vulnerable to errors during analog aggregation. While removing users with unfavorable channel conditions can mitigate these errors, it also reduces the available local training data for FL, which in turn hinders the convergence rate of the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose using fluid antenna (FA) techniques to enhance the degrees of freedom within the channel space, ultimately boosting the convergence speed of FL training. Moreover, we develop a novel approach that effectively coordinates uplink receiver beamforming, user selection, and FA positioning to optimize the convergence rate of OTA FL training in dynamic wireless environments. We address this challenging stochastic optimization by reformulating it as a mixed-integer programming problem by utilizing the training loss upper bound. We then introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to solve the mixed-integer mixed programming problem. Experimental results indicate that incorporating FA techniques significantly accelerates the training convergence of FL and greatly surpasses conventional methods.</p>

            <p>Cascading failure studies help assess and enhance the robustness of power systems against severe power outages. Onset time is a critical parameter in the analysis and management of power system stability and reliability, representing the timeframe within which initial disturbances may lead to subsequent cascading failures. In this paper, different traditional machine learning algorithms are used to predict the onset time of cascading failures. The prediction task is articulated as a multi-class classification problem, employing machine learning algorithms. The results on the UIUC 150-Bus power system data available publicly show high classification accuracy with Random Forest. The hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier are tuned using Bayesian Optimization. This study highlights the potential of machine learning models in predicting cascading failures, providing a foundation for the development of more resilient power systems.</p>

            <h2>Unified Power Flow Model for Bipolar HVDC Grids in Unbalanced Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chandra Kant Jat, Francesco Giacomo Puricelli, Jef Beerten, Hakan Ergun, Dirk Van Hertem</p>
            <p>In the near future, point-to-point High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems are expected to evolve into multi-terminal and meshed HVDC grids, predominantly adopting a bipolar HVDC configuration. Normally, bipolar HVDC systems operate in balanced mode, i.e., near zero current flows through metallic or ground return. However, bipolar HVDC systems can also be operated in an unbalanced mode in case of a single converter pole or line conductor outage. A steady-state analysis of the unbalanced DC network requires solving a power flow problem including various converter control modes, as the steady-state behavior of the converters is governed by their control modes. This paper presents a comprehensive and unified power flow model for the balanced and unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids, including various converter control modes on the AC and DC sides of the converter, in a hybrid AC/DC system. It extends the basic control modes, developed for monopolar HVDC grids, to support the balanced as well as unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids. Additionally, an AC-droop control, which defines a droop relationship between voltage magnitude and reactive power at the AC side of the converter, is incorporated into the modeling of bipolar HVDC systems. The functionality of the proposed model is demonstrated through a test case, and the power flow results are validated using PSCAD simulations. The impact of converter control modes on post-contingency system states is also investigated for single-pole contingencies. The proposed model is implemented as an open-source tool in the Julia/JuMP framework, where larger test cases demonstrate the robustness of the model and tool.</p>

            <h2>Extended Impedance Modal Analysis of Internal Dynamics in Grid-Following Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Zheng, Jiajie Zheng, Lei Chen, Chongru Liu</p>
            <p>As the penetration of Grid-Following inverters (GFL) in power systems continues to increase, the dynamic characteristics of power systems undergo significant transformations. Recently, modal analysis based on the impedance model (MAI) has been utilized to evaluate the interaction between GFLs and the power grid through impedance/admittance participation factors (PF). However, MAI relies on the impedance model that characterizes the input-output behavior of the ports, treating the GFL as a single integrated entity. This approach limits its ability to reveal the complex dynamic coupling mechanism between different control loops inside the GFL. In this paper, we propose an extended impedance modal analysis (EMAI) method. Firstly, the equivalent dynamics of the GFL are decomposed into two components: the synchronous dynamic dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL) and the electromagnetic dynamic dominated by the current control loop (CCL). The PF and participation ratios (PR) of these two dynamic components are then calculated to identify the dominant dynamics of the system. Building on this, we introduce the explicit parameter participation factors (PPF) to further pinpoint the key parameters of the dominant control loop, which provides a way for enhancing system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the simulation of the modified 14-bus and 68-bus systems. The EMAI method enables the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of each control loop in the GFL based on the impedance model. It can effectively identify the critical control loops influencing system stability without requiring the construction of a full state-space model, demonstrating its broad applicability and value.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a two-timescale uplink transmission framework for a fluid antenna-enabled multiuser multi-input multi-output system (MIMO-FAS). Antenna positions are optimized based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) adapt to instantaneous CSI. Under a Rician fading channel with imperfect CSI, we establish a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation approach and derive a closed-form expression for the achievable uplink rate using a low-complexity maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) detector. The optimization problem is formulated as a minimum user rate maximization problem by optimizing the fluid antenna positions, subject to the feasible region and the minimum spacing distance constraints. To address this non-convex problem, a genetic algorithm (GA) method is proposed, encoding antenna configurations as population individuals. Additionally, an accelerated gradient ascent algorithm is proposed to enhance computational efficiency. Numerical results validate the mathematical derivations and demonstrate that the proposed two-timescale transmission strategy significantly outperforms traditional FPA systems, with both algorithms achieving enhanced gains.</p>

            <p>Task-oriented integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) is a key technology for achieving low-latency edge inference and enabling efficient implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the constrained energy supply at edge devices has emerged as a critical bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient ISCC framework for AI inference at resource-constrained edge devices, where adjustable split inference, model pruning, and feature quantization are jointly designed to adapt to diverse task requirements. A joint resource allocation design problem for the proposed ISCC framework is formulated to minimize the energy consumption under stringent inference accuracy and latency constraints. To address the challenge of characterizing inference accuracy, we derive an explicit approximation for it by analyzing the impact of sensing, communication, and computation processes on the inference performance. Building upon the analytical results, we propose an iterative algorithm employing alternating optimization to solve the resource allocation problem. In each subproblem, the optimal solutions are available by respectively applying a golden section search method and checking the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, thereby ensuring the convergence to a local optimum of the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISCC design, showing a significant reduction in energy consumption of up to 40% compared to existing methods, particularly in low-latency scenarios.</p>

            <p>Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics. However, current tools including genomic assays lack the accuracy required for optimal clinical decision-making. We developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that integrates digital pathology images with clinical data, providing a more robust and effective method for predicting the risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 female breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five evaluation cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p<0.001]). In a direct comparison (n=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, achieving a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent prognostic information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p<0.001)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across major molecular breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test improves upon the accuracy of existing prognostic tests, while being applicable to a wider range of patients.</p>

            <p>Automatic detection and severity assessment of dysarthria are crucial for delivering targeted therapeutic interventions to patients. While most existing research focuses primarily on speech modality, this study introduces a novel approach that leverages both speech and text modalities. By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability.

This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks.

            <h2>Leveraging Convex Relaxation to Identify the Feasibility of Conducting AC False Data Injection Attack in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammadreza Iranpour, Mohammad Rasoul Narimani</p>
            <p>FDI (False Data Injection) attacks are critical to address as they can compromise the integrity and reliability of data in cyber-physical systems, leading to potentially severe consequences in sectors such as power systems. The feasibility of FDI attacks has been extensively studied from various perspectives, including access to measurements and sensors, knowledge of the system, and design considerations using residual-based detection methods. Most research has focused on DC-based FDI attacks; however, designing AC FDI attacks involves solving a nonlinear optimization problem, presenting additional challenges in assessing their feasibility. Specifically, it is often unclear whether the infeasibility of some designed AC FDI attacks is due to the nonconvexity and nonlinearity inherent to AC power flows or if it stems from inherent infeasibility in specific cases, with local solvers returning infeasibility. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging the principle that if a convexified AC FDI attack design problem is infeasible, the attack design itself is infeasible, irrespective of nonlinear solution challenges. We propose an AC FDI attack design based on convexified power flow equations and assess the feasibility of the proposed attack by examining the extent of the attackable region. This approach utilizes a Quadratic Convex (QC) relaxation technique to convexify AC power flows. To evaluate the proposed method, we implement it on the IEEE 118-bus test system and assess the feasibility of an AC FDI attack across various attack zones.</p>

            <h2>Unmasking Stealthy Attacks on Nonlinear DAE Models of Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdallah Alalem Albustami, Ahmad F. Taha, Elias Bou-Harb</p>
            <p>Smart grids are inherently susceptible to various types of malicious cyberattacks that have all been documented in the recent literature. Traditional cybersecurity research on power systems often utilizes simplified models that fail to capture the interactions between dynamic and steady-state behaviors, potentially underestimating the impact of cyber threats. This paper presents the first attempt to design and assess stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against nonlinear differential algebraic equation (NDAE) models of power networks. NDAE models, favored in industry for their ability to accurately capture both dynamic and steady-state behaviors, provide a more accurate representation of power system behavior by coupling dynamic and algebraic states. We propose novel FDIA strategies that simultaneously evade both dynamic and static intrusion detection systems while respecting the algebraic power flow and operational constraints inherent in NDAE models. We demonstrate how the coupling between dynamic and algebraic states in NDAE models significantly restricts the attacker's ability to manipulate state estimates while maintaining stealthiness. This highlights the importance of using more comprehensive power system models in cybersecurity analysis and reveals potential vulnerabilities that may be overlooked in simplified representations. The proposed attack strategies are validated through simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze Hu, Ziqing Zhu, Linghua Zhu, Xiang Wei, Siqi Bu, Ka Wing Chan</p>
            <p>Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) is essential for efficient power system planning and real-time operation but remains an NP-hard and non-convex optimization problem with significant computational challenges. This paper proposes a novel hybrid classical-quantum deep learning framework for AC-OPF problem, integrating parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for feature extraction with classical deep learning for data encoding and decoding. The proposed framework integrates two types of residual connection structures to mitigate the ``barren plateau" problem in quantum circuits, enhancing training stability and convergence. Furthermore, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) module is incorporated to guarantee tolerable constraint violation, improving the physical consistency and reliability of AC-OPF solutions. Experimental evaluations on multiple IEEE test systems demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy, generalization, and robustness to quantum noise while requiring minimal quantum resources.</p>

            <h2>Time series forecasting based on optimized LLM for fault prediction in distribution power grid insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> João Pedro Matos-Carvalho, Stefano Frizzo Stefenon, Valderi Reis Quietinho Leithardt, Kin-Choong Yow</p>
            <p>Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p>

            <h2>Battery State of Health Estimation and Incremental Capacity Analysis for Charging with General Current Profiles Using Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinan Zhou, Gabrielle Vuylsteke, R. Dyche Anderson, Jing Sun</p>
            <p>Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) conventionally require constant-current conditions for battery degradation monitoring, which restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a unified approach to enable ICA/DVA-based degradation monitoring under general charging current profiles, which has not been addressed previously in the literature. First, a novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (IC) and different voltage (DV) is proposed. Second, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct virtual IC/DV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from general charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) ranges that satisfy some constraints. Finally, two CNNs, called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net, are proposed to replace the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, for onboard implementations. They significantly reduce the computation and memory requirements, while retaining performance in virtual IC/DV curve construction and SOH estimation. Tested on an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules with various fast-charging protocols and SOC ranges, the proposed U-Net and Mobile U-Net construct accurate virtual IC/DV curves which enable the extraction of valuable degradation features. The proposed Conv-Net and Mobile-Net provide module-level SOH estimates with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5%.</p>

            <p>Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.</p>

            <h2>Transient Stability Analysis and Fault Clearing Angle Estimation of VSG Based on Domain of Attraction Estimated by Trajectory Reversing Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayue Lyu, Tianzhi Fang, Zhiheng Lin, Jingxue Han, Yantao Zhu</p>
            <p>The virtual synchronous generator (VSG), with the analogous nonlinear power-angle relationship to the synchronous generator (SG), has attracted much attention as a promising solution for converter-based power systems. In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p>

            <h2>Model-Free Privacy Preserving Power Flow Analysis in Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Liu, Juan S. Giraldo, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Model-free power flow calculation, driven by the rise of smart meter (SM) data and the lack of network topology, often relies on artificial intelligence neural networks (ANNs). However, training ANNs require vast amounts of SM data, posing privacy risks for households in distribution networks. To ensure customers' privacy during the SM data gathering and online sharing, we introduce a privacy preserving PF calculation framework, composed of two local strategies: a local randomisation strategy (LRS) and a local zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based data collection strategy. First, the LRS is used to achieve irreversible transformation and robust privacy protection for active and reactive power data, thereby ensuring that personal data remains confidential. Subsequently, the ZKP-based data collecting strategy is adopted to securely gather the training dataset for the ANN, enabling SMs to interact with the distribution system operator without revealing the actual voltage magnitude. Moreover, to mitigate the accuracy loss induced by the seasonal variations in load profiles, an incremental learning strategy is incorporated into the online application. The results across three datasets with varying measurement errors demonstrate that the proposed framework efficiently collects one month of SM data within one hour. Furthermore, it robustly maintains mean errors of 0.005 p.u. and 0.014 p.u. under multiple measurement errors and seasonal variations in load profiles, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhikai Huang, Shuai Lu, Wei Gu, Ruizhi Yu, Suhan Zhang, Yijun Xu, Yuan Li</p>
            <p>Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) requires dynamic energy flow (DEF) simulation tools that achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the inherent strong nonlinearity of gas dynamics and its bidirectional coupling with power grids impose significant challenges on conventional numerical algorithms, particularly in computational efficiency and accuracy. Considering this, we propose a novel non-iterative semi-analytical algorithm based on differential transformation (DT) for DEF simulation of IEGS. First, we introduce a semi-discrete difference method to convert the partial differential algebraic equations of the DEF model into ordinary differential algebraic equations to resort to the DT. Particularly, by employing spatial central difference and numerical boundary extrapolation, we effectively avoid the singularity issue of the DT coefficient matrix. Second, we propose a DT-based semi-analytical solution method, which can yield the solution of the DEF model by recursion. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Electric power system security: the case for an integrated cyber-physical risk management framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Efthymios Karangelos, Louis Wehenkel</p>
            <p>This paper concerns the security of the electric power transmission grid facing the threat of malicious cyber-physical attackers. We posit that there is no such thing as perfectly effective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security measure comes with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could (eventually find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a tri-level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive physical and cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the ability of an exogenous cyber-physical attacker to overcome the latter. Preventive physical security measures refer to the \emph{ex-ante} procurement of reserve capacity, which translates into ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures refer to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from taking over the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting power generators and transmission branches. We adopt standard assumptions to formalize the inner optimization problems corresponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power grid operator and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level of the problem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-security measures are non-exchangeable complements in keeping the power grid operation secure.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning for Fairness-Aware Load Shedding: A Real-Time Solution via Identifying Binding Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Zhou, Joseph Severino, Sanjana Vijayshankar, Juliette Ugirumurera, Jibo Sanyal</p>
            <p>Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economic and fairness considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering fairness-aware and real-time load shedding decisions.</p>

            <h2>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liudong Chen, Jay Sethuraman, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Power system operators and electric utility companies often charge consumers a peak demand charge when the aggregate system demand reaches its maximum, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce usage during critical periods, alleviating stress on electricity transmission and distribution systems, while also helping to recover the grid investment costs. In this paper, we analyze the problem through the lens of game theory, developing a model that captures how strategic consumer behavior influences overall system efficiency. Our results reveal that the coincident peak shaving game can be concave, quasiconcave with discontinuities, or non-concave with discontinuities, depending on the extent of consumers' demand-shifting capabilities. In a two-agent, two-period framework, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions for each scenario and extend our analysis to multi-agent settings. We prove the stability of these equilibrium points and propose an algorithm to compute equilibrium outcomes across all game configurations. Furthermore, we show that while the decentralized game model achieves peak-shaving performance comparable to a centralized approach, it does so at the cost of increased anarchy. In scenarios characterized by quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, our analytical results demonstrate that anarchy grows with greater consumer flexibility and disparities in marginal shifting costs, and we explore how the number of agents affects system efficiency. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Solha Kang, Wesley De Neve, Francois Rameau, Utku Ozbulak</p>
            <p>The past decade has witnessed a substantial increase in the number of startups and companies offering AI-based solutions for clinical decision support in medical institutions. However, the critical nature of medical decision-making raises several concerns about relying on external software. Key issues include potential variations in image modalities and the medical devices used to obtain these images, potential legal issues, and adversarial attacks. Fortunately, the open-source nature of machine learning research has made foundation models publicly available and straightforward to use for medical applications. This accessibility allows medical institutions to train their own AI-based models, thereby mitigating the aforementioned concerns. Given this context, an important question arises: how much data do medical institutions need to train effective AI models? In this study, we explore this question in relation to breast cancer detection, a particularly contested area due to the prevalence of this disease, which affects approximately 1 in every 8 women. Through large-scale experiments on various patient sizes in the training set, we show that medical institutions do not need a decade's worth of MRI images to train an AI model that performs competitively with the state-of-the-art, provided the model leverages foundation models. Furthermore, we observe that for patient counts greater than 50, the number of patients in the training set has a negligible impact on the performance of models and that simple ensembles further improve the results without additional complexity.</p>

            <p>Great Britain aims to meet growing electricity demand and achieve a fully decarbonised grid by 2035, targeting 70 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. However, grid constraints and connection delays hinder solar integration. To address these integration challenges, various connection reform processes and policies are being developed [1]. This study supports the connection reforms with a model that estimates regional PV capacity at the NUTS 3 level, explaining 89% of the variation in capacity, with a mean absolute error of 20 MW and a national mean absolute percentage error of 5.4%. Artificial surfaces and agricultural areas are identified as key factors in deployment. The model has three primary applications: disaggregating national PV capacity into regional capacity, benchmarking regional PV deployment between different regions, and forecasting future PV capacity distribution. These applications support grid operators in generation monitoring and strategic grid planning by identifying regions where capacity is likely to be concentrated. This can address grid connection delays, plan network expansions, and resolve land-use conflicts.</p>

            <p>In scenarios where high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) is connected to the grid over long distances, the output of RES exhibits significant fluctuations, making it difficult to accurately characterize. The intermittency and uncertainty of these fluctuations pose challenges to the stability of the power system. This paper proposes a distributionally robust damping optimization control framework (DRDOC) to address the uncertainty in the true distribution of random disturbances caused by RES. First, the installation location of damping controllers and key control parameters are determined through Sobol sensitivity indices and participation factors. Next, a nonlinear relationship between damping and random disturbances is established with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). The uncertainty in the distribution of disturbances is captured by ambiguity sets. The DRDOC is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which is further simplified for efficient computation. Finally, the optimal control parameters are derived through convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and distribution robustness of the proposed DRDOC.</p>

            <p>Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) is essential for efficient planning and real-time operation in power systems but is NP-hard and non-convex, leading to significant computational challenges. Neural networks (NNs) offer computational speedups in solving OPF but face issues like dependency on large datasets, scalability limitations, and inability to enforce physical constraints, compromising solution reliability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) that integrate quantum computing principles into neural network architectures. Leveraging quantum mechanics properties such as superposition and entanglement, QNNs can capture complex input-output relationships more effectively and learn from small or noisy this http URL further improve the performance of QNNs and investigate the interplay between classical and quantum components in hybrid architectures, we incorporate advanced techniques, including residual learning and physics-informed machine learning, into the hybrid QNN designs. These enhancements aim to boost convergence efficiency, lower errors, superior generalization, and robustness to quantum noise. Simulation results demonstrate that these enhanced hybrid QNNs outperform typical hybrid QNNs in solving OPF problems. This work provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid QNNs, highlighting the potential of quantum computation for broader applications in power systems.</p>

A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective.

            <p>In most countries, small (<2 kg) and medium (<25 kg) size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must fly at low altitude, below 120 m, and with permanent radio communications with ground for control and telemetry.

In this case, reflection and diffraction from ground objects are critical to maintain links, and hence accurate propagation models for this must be considered. In this letter we present a model for path loss when the UAV is flying in NLOS conditions. The study is based on measurements made at frequencies of 1, 4, 12, and 24 GHz with a UAV flying in a suburban environment. Measurements have been used to model NLOS propagation below 4 GHz, where the dominant mechanism is diffraction, and above 4GHzwhere multipath is the dominant propagationmechanism. The model can be of use in predicting excess losses when UAVs fly in suburban NLOS conditions.</p>

            <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p>

In our proposed approach, we integrate a semantic-aware discriminator to reconstruct fine details more accurately and employ an adaptive degradation model to better simulate real-world degradations. Moreover, we introduce a new combination of loss functions by adding wavelet loss to loss functions of GAN-based models to better recover high-frequency details. Empirical results demonstrate that IG-CFAT significantly outperforms existing SOTA models in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our proposed model revolutionizes the field of real-world image super-resolution and demonstrates substantially better performance in recovering fine details and generating realistic textures. The introduction of IG-CFAT offers a robust and adaptable solution for real-world image super-resolution tasks.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Joint Radar and Communication User Association in Cell-Free mMIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Naeem, El Mehdi Amhoud, Hüseyin Arslan</p>
            <p>The cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are crucial for 6G development due to their high spectral efficiency and uniform user-experienced data rates. A key aspect of CF-mMIMO is user association (UA) and optimal cluster formation. Traditional methods focusing solely on communication-related metrics fall short in this context, as sensing is becoming integral to 6G. This study delves into a framework for joint radar and communication (JRC) in CF-mMIMO systems and investigates JRC-based UA techniques. We propose a novel method to optimize UA, enhancing both communication spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. Existing literature has not explored this dual requirement integration for UA. Our proposed two-step scheme optimizes UA clusters for both communication and sensing. The first step involves selecting access points (APs) based on channel quality, followed by a second step that further refines the selection by choosing APs from the initial group that are also optimal for sensing. We utilize the signal-clutter plus noise ratio to exclude APs with clutter in front of the user equipment (UE) and the AP view angle, ensuring that radar echoes are received only from the specific UE, not the surrounding clutter. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the same APs optimized for communication are not necessarily optimal for sensing, highlighting the need for schemes that incorporate sensing requirements in UA. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing its potential to improve CF-mMIMO system performance in JRC scenarios.</p>

            <p>Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer.

            <h2>Optimal Distribution System Restoration with Tractable Modeling of Decision-Dependent Interruption Cost and Cold Load Pickup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Wang, Minwu Chen, Hongbin Wang, Gaoqiang Peng, Hongzhou Chen</p>
            <p>Developing optimized restoration strategies for power distribution systems (PDSs) is essential to meet the pressing demand for enhanced resilience. Prior knowledge of customer interruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load pickup (CLPU), is crucial for guiding effective restoration; however, both are reciprocally affected by the realized customer interruption duration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model especially given the limited understanding of underlying physical mechanisms. This paper presents a novel approach by constructing tractable models to capture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns which can be derived from limited data and reflect observed surface-level correlations rather than underlying mechanisms, thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these decision-dependencies. Specifically, quadratic functions are used to model the increasing rate of CIC with CID based on data fitting. Several defining characteristics of CLPU are extracted, each modeled in a piecewise linear form relative to CID, and the actual restored load accounting for CLPU is subsequently retrieved. Building on these models, a PDS restoration optimization model is constructed, incorporating mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) and network reconfiguration. Case studies validate our approach and also highlight MESS's unique potential to accelerate CLPU-related restoration.</p>

            <h2>Squint-Aware Synesthesia of Machine (SoM)-Driven Analog Precoder Optimization for Enhanced ISAC Performance in Sub-THz Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) mobile information networks. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading the communication performance. Existing analog precoder designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware analog precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware architecture to enhance ISAC performance. We first introduce a squint-aware optimization-based analog precoder design approach (SA-Opt). Inspired by the synesthesia of machine (SoM), we further develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity based on both communication and sensing channel data, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Bidding Strategies for Prosumers Trading in Double Auction-Based Transactive Energy Market</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Jiang, Yuanliang Li, Luyang Hou, Mohsen Ghafouri, Peng Zhang, Jun Yan, Yuhong Liu</p>
            <p>With the large number of prosumers deploying distributed energy resources (DERs), integrating these prosumers into a transactive energy market (TEM) is a trend for the future smart grid. A community-based double auction market is considered a promising TEM that can encourage prosumers to participate and maximize social welfare. However, the traditional TEM is challenging to model explicitly due to the random bidding behavior of prosumers and uncertainties caused by the energy operation of DERs. Furthermore, although reinforcement learning algorithms provide a model-free solution to optimize prosumers' bidding strategies, their use in TEM is still challenging due to their scalability, stability, and privacy protection limitations. To address the above challenges, in this study, we design a double auction-based TEM with multiple DERs-equipped prosumers to transparently and efficiently manage energy transactions. We also propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model with distributed learning and execution to ensure the scalability and privacy of the market environment. Additionally, the design of two bidding actions (i.e., bidding price and quantity) optimizes the bidding strategies for prosumers. Simulation results show that (1) the designed TEM and DRL model are robust; (2) the proposed DRL model effectively balances the energy payment and comfort satisfaction for prosumers and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the bidding strategies.</p>

            <h2>TSS GAZ PTP: Towards Improving Gumbel AlphaZero with Two-stage Self-play for Multi-constrained Electric Vehicle Routing Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Wang, Xufeng Zhang, Xiaoyu Zhang, Zhenhuan Ding, Chaoxu Mu</p>
            <p>Recently, Gumbel AlphaZero~(GAZ) was proposed to solve classic combinatorial optimization problems such as TSP and JSSP by creating a carefully designed competition model~(consisting of a learning player and a competitor player), which leverages the idea of self-play. However, if the competitor is too strong or too weak, the effectiveness of self-play training can be reduced, particularly in complex CO problems. To address this problem, we further propose a two-stage self-play strategy to improve the GAZ method~(named TSS GAZ PTP). In the first stage, the learning player uses the enhanced policy network based on the Gumbel Monte Carlo Tree Search~(MCTS), and the competitor uses the historical best trained policy network~(acts as a greedy player). In the second stage, we employ Gumbel MCTS for both players, which makes the competition fiercer so that both players can continuously learn smarter trajectories. We first investigate the performance of our proposed TSS GAZ PTP method on TSP since it is also used as a test problem by the original GAZ. The results show the superior performance of TSS GAZ PTP. Then we extend TSS GAZ PTP to deal with multi-constrained Electric Vehicle Routing Problems~(EVRP), which is a recently well-known real application research topic and remains challenging as a complex CO problem. Impressively, the experimental results show that the TSS GAZ PTP outperforms the state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning methods in all types of instances tested and outperforms the optimization solver in tested large-scale instances, indicating the importance and promising of employing more dynamic self-play strategies for complex CO problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Chen Weidong, Huang Zhifeng, Md Raisul Islam, Chua Kian Jon</p>
            <p>In tropical countries with high humidity, air conditioning can account for up to 60% of a building's energy use. For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Convergence of Iterative Water-Filling in Multi-User Non-Cooperative Power Control: A Comprehensive Analysis for Sequential, Simultaneous, and Asynchronous Schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Wang</p>
            <p>Non-cooperative game theory provides a robust framework for analyzing distributed resource allocation in multi-user wireless networks, with \emph{Iterative Water-Filling} (IWF) emerging as a canonical solution for power control problems. Although classical fixed-point theorems guarantee the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) under mild concavity and compactness conditions, the convergence of practical iterative algorithms to that equilibrium remains a challenging endeavor. This challenge intensifies under varying update schedules, interference regimes, and imperfections such as channel estimation errors or feedback delay. In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of IWF in multi-user systems under three different update schemes: (1) synchronous \emph{sequential} updates, (2) synchronous \emph{simultaneous} updates, and (3) \emph{totally asynchronous} updates. We first formulate the water-filling operator in a multi-carrier environment, then recast the iterative process as a fixed-point problem. Using contraction mapping principles, we demonstrate sufficient conditions under which IWF converges to a unique NE and highlight how spectral radius constraints, diagonal dominance, and careful step-size selection are pivotal for guaranteeing convergence. We further discuss robustness to measurement noise, partial updates, and network scaling to emphasize the practical viability of these schemes. This comprehensive analysis unifies diverse threads in the literature while offering novel insights into asynchronous implementations. Our findings enable network designers to ascertain system parameters that foster both stable convergence and efficient spectrum usage.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.</p>

            <p>With the rapid development of smart distribution networks (DNs), the integrity and accuracy of grid measurement data are crucial to the safety and stability of the entire system. However, the quality of the user power consumption data cannot be guaranteed during the collection and transmission process. To this end, this paper proposes a low-rank tensor completion model based on CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD-LRTC) to enhance the quality of the measurement data of the DNs. Firstly, the causes and the associated characteristics of the missing data are analyzed, and a third-order standard tensor is constructed as a mathematical model of the measurement data of the DN. Then, a completion model is established based on the characteristics of measurement data and the low rank of the completion tensor, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve it iteratively. Finally, the proposed model is verified through two case studies, the completion accuracy, the computational efficiency, and the memory usage are compared to traditional methods.</p>

            <p>As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) continues to grow, the demand for charging stations is also increasing, leading to challenges such as long wait times and insufficient infrastructure. High-precision forecasting of EV charging demand is crucial for efficient station management, to address some of these challenges. This paper presents an approach to predict the charging demand at 15-minute intervals for the day ahead using a multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism. Additionally, the model leverages explainable AI techniques to evaluate the influence of various factors on the predictions, including weather conditions, day of the week, month, and any holiday. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used to quantify the contribution of each feature to the final forecast, providing deeper insights into how these factors affect prediction accuracy. As a result, the framework offers enhanced decision-making for infrastructure planning. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations using the test data collected from the EV charging stations at California State University, Long Beach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kejun Chen, Shourya Bose, Yu Zhang</p>
            <p>The optimal power flow (OPF) problem can be rapidly and reliably solved by employing responsive online solvers based on neural networks. The dynamic nature of renewable energy generation and the variability of power grid conditions necessitate frequent neural network updates with new data instances. To address this need and reduce the time required for data preparation time, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework aided by data augmentation. In this context, ridge regression replaces the traditional solver, facilitating swift prediction of optimal solutions for the given input load demands. Additionally, to accelerate the backpropagation during training, we develop novel batch-mean gradient estimation approaches along with a reduced branch set to alleviate the complexity of gradient computation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our neural network, equipped with the proposed gradient estimators, consistently achieves feasible and near-optimal solutions. These results underline the effectiveness of our approach for practical implementation in real-time OPF applications.</p>

            <p>A driving force for the realization of a sustainable energy supply is the integration of renewable energy resources. Due to their stochastic generation behaviour, energy utilities are confronted with a more complex operation of the underlying power grids. Additionally, due to technology developments, controllable loads, integration with other energy sources, changing regulatory rules, and the market liberalization, the systems operation needs adaptation. Proper operational concepts and intelligent automation provide the basis to turn the existing power system into an intelligent entity, a cyber-physical energy system. The electric energy system is therefore moving from a single system to a system of systems. While reaping the benefits with new intelligent behaviors, it is expected that system-level developments, architectural concepts, advanced automation and control as well as the validation and testing will play a significantly larger role in realizing future solutions and technologies. The implementation and deployment of these complex systems of systems are associated with increasing engineering complexity resulting also in increased engineering costs. Proper engineering and validation approaches, concepts, and tools are partly missing until now. Therefore, this paper discusses and summarizes the main needs and requirements as well as the status quo in research and development related to the engineering and validation of cyber-physical energy systems.

            <p>An immediate need in the transmission system is to find alternative solutions that improve system operation and defer the need for new transmission lines. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance and economic benefits of short-term operation of using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as virtual transmission (VT) to promote power transfer across distant regions. Specifically, this work implements various day-ahead energy scheduling models to analyze the impact of VT on system operation cost, network congestion, model computational time, and market performance. The performance of VT is compared with three alternative network congestion mitigation methods, including building new high-voltage physical transmission lines, cost-driven battery energy storage systems, and network reconfiguration, as well as combinations of two of the aforementioned methods. The benchmark dayahead scheduling model is a traditional security-constrained unit commitment model without system upgrades or other network congestion mitigation. Numerical simulations conducted on the IEEE 24-bus system demonstrate that VT provides a 14% operational cost reduction and 34% congested line relief compared to the base case. Compared to other examined schemes, VT is the only one comparable to physical transmission lines that can provide satisfying congestion relief and operation cost reduction without significantly sacrificing computing time and load payment.</p>

            <p>Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianyu Xu, Qiuzhuang Sun, Yang Yang, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong</p>
            <p>The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</p>

            <h2>A Risk-Averse Just-In-Time Scheme for Learning-Based Operation of Microgrids with Coupled Electricity-Hydrogen-Ammonia under Uncertainties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longyan Li, Chao Ning, Guangsheng Pan, Leiqi Zhang, Wei Gu, Liang Zhao, Wenli Du, Mohammad Shahidehpour</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a Risk-Averse Just-In-Time (RAJIT) operation scheme for Ammonia-Hydrogen-based Micro-Grids (AHMGs) to boost electricity-hydrogen-ammonia coupling under uncertainties. First, an off-grid AHMG model is developed, featuring a novel multi-mode ammonia synthesis process and a hydrogen-ammonia dual gas turbine with tunable feed-in ratios. Subsequently, a state-behavior mapping strategy linking hydrogen storage levels with the operation modes of ammonia synthesis is established to prevent cost-ineffective shutdowns. The proposed model substantially improves operational flexibility but results in a challenging nonlinear fractional program. Based upon this model, a data-driven RAJIT scheme is developed for the real-time rolling optimization of AHMGs. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all schemes using one optimization method throughout, the data driven RAJIT intelligently switches between cost-effective deterministic optimization and risk-averse online-learning distributionally robust optimization depending on actual risk profiles, thus capitalizing on the respective strengths of these two optimization methods. To facilitate the solution of the resulting nonlinear program, we develop an equivalent-reformulation-based solution methodology by leveraging a constraint-tightening technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees safety and yields an overall cost reduction up to 14.6% compared with several state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p>The electric distribution system is a cornerstone of modern life, playing a critical role in the daily activities and well-being of individuals. As the world transitions toward a decarbonized future, where even mobility relies on electricity, ensuring the resilience of the grid becomes paramount.

The metrics focus on emergency storm response and the resources required to improve customer service. The practical calculation of the metrics from historical utility data is demonstrated for multiple storm events. Additionally, the metrics' improvement with added crews is estimated by "rerunning history" with faster restoration. By applying this resilience framework, utilities can enhance their restoration strategies and unlock potential cost savings, benefiting both providers and customers in an era of heightened energy dependency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo L. Aschidamini, Mina Pavlovic, Bradley A. Reinholz, Malcolm S. Metcalfe, Taco Niet, Mariana Resener</p>
            <p>Decarbonization plans promote the transition to heat pumps (HPs), creating new opportunities for their energy flexibility in demand response programs, solar photovoltaic integration and optimization of distribution networks. This paper reviews scheduling-based and real-time optimization methods for controlling HPs with a focus on energy flexibility in distribution networks. Scheduling-based methods fall into two categories: rule-based controllers (RBCs), which rely on predefined control rules without explicitly seeking optimal solutions, and optimization models, which are designed to determine the optimal scheduling of operations. Real-time optimization is achieved through model predictive control (MPC), which relies on a predictive model to optimize decisions over a time horizon, and reinforcement learning (RL), which takes a model-free approach by learning optimal strategies through direct interaction with the environment. The paper also examines studies on the impact of HPs on distribution networks, particularly those leveraging energy flexibility strategies. Key takeaways suggest the need to validate control strategies for extreme cold-weather regions that require backup heaters, as well as develop approaches designed for demand charge schemes that integrate HPs with other controllable loads. From a grid impact assessment perspective, studies have focused primarily on RBCs for providing energy flexibility through HP operation, without addressing more advanced methods such as real-time optimization using MPC or RL-based algorithms. Incorporating these advanced control strategies could help identify key limitations, including the impact of varying user participation levels and the cost-benefit trade-offs associated with their implementation.</p>

            <p>We propose a risk-sensitive security-constrained economic dispatch (R-SCED) formulation capturing the tradeoff between dispatch cost and resilience against potential line failures, where risk is modeled via the conditional value at risk (CVaR). In the context of our formulation, we analyze revenue adequacy and side payments of two pricing models, one based on nominal generation costs, and another based on total marginal cost including contingencies. In particular, we prove that the system operator's (SO) merchandising surplus (MS) and total revenue are nonnegative under the latter, while under the former the same does not hold in general. We demonstrate that the proposed R-SCED formulation is amenable to decomposition and describe a Benders' decomposition algorithm to solve it. In numerical examples, we illustrate the differences in MS and total revenue under the considered pricing schemes, and the computational efficiency of our decomposition approach.</p>

            <p>Solar home systems provide low-cost electricity access for rural off-grid communities. As access to them increases, more long-term data becomes available on how these systems are used throughout their lifetime. This work analyses a dataset of 1,000 systems across sub-Saharan Africa. Dynamic time warping clustering was applied to the load demand data from the systems, identifying five distinct archetypal daily load profiles and their occurrence across the dataset. Temporal analysis reveals a general decline in daily energy consumption over time, with 57% of households reducing their usage after the first year of ownership. On average, there is a 33% decrease in daily consumption by the end of the second year compared to the peak demand, which occurs on the 96th day. Combining the load demand analysis with payment data shows that this decrease in energy consumption is observed even in households that are not experiencing economic hardship, indicating there are reasons beyond financial constraints for decreasing energy use once energy access is obtained.</p>

            <h2>Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Optimal Solutions and Efficient Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lebin Chen, Ming-Min Zhao, Min-Jian Zhao, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by movable antennas (MAs), which can dynamically adjust antenna positions to enhance both sensing and communication performance for future wireless networks. To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we first derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized for optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. In particular, for the case with receive MAs only, we provide a closed-form optimal antenna position solution, and show that employing MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) can achieve a sensing performance gain upper-bounded by 4.77 dB. On the other hand, for the case with transmit MAs only, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution in the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. While in the scenario with non-LoS (NLoS) channels, a majorization-minimization (MM) based Rosen's gradient projection (RGP) algorithm with an efficient initialization method is proposed to obtain stationary solutions for the considered problem, which can be extended to the general case with both transmit and receive MAs. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with FPAs in terms of sensing and communication performance trade-off.</p>

            <p>Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. We theoretically analyze the inconsistency in terms of both multilingual modal alignment direction error and weight error, and propose the theoretical weight error upper bound for quantifying the inconsistency. Based on the analysis of the weight error upper bound, we find that the inconsistency problem stems from the data distribution error caused by random sampling of languages. We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English.

            <p>This paper presents a hierarchical framework for demand response optimization in air separation units (ASUs) that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with linear model predictive control (LMPC). We investigate two control architectures: a direct RL approach and a control-informed methodology where an RL agent provides setpoints to a lower-level LMPC. The proposed RL-LMPC framework demonstrates improved sample efficiency during training and better constraint satisfaction compared to direct RL control. Using an industrial ASU case study, we show that our approach successfully manages operational constraints while optimizing electricity costs under time-varying pricing. Results indicate that the RL-LMPC architecture achieves comparable economic performance to direct RL while providing better robustness and requiring fewer training samples to converge. The framework offers a practical solution for implementing flexible operation strategies in process industries, bridging the gap between data-driven methods and traditional control approaches.</p>

Load-independent design of Class E/EF inverter has recently attracted widespread interest. However, applying this design to IPT systems has proven challenging when the coupling coefficient is weak.

Therefore, the system can maintain stable output even under a low coupling coefficient. A 400 kHz experimental prototype validates these findings. The experimental results indicate that the output power fluctuation remains within 15% as the coupling coefficient varies from 0.04 to 0.07. The peak power efficiency achieving 91%</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Bhatt, Siddharth Penumatsa, Nirbhay Singhal</p>
            <p>The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration & Coordination Gains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasser Nabil, Hesham ElSawy, Hossam S. Hassanein</p>
            <p>This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxun Liu, Shijian Gao, Zonghui Yang, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a promising technology for B5G/6G, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.</p>

            <p>Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, especially the non-terrestrial network (NTN). The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. This article introduces three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, such as cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Subsequently, key technical challenges severely influencing the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Wang, Rong Zhou, Han Xie, Xiaoying Tang, Lifang He, Carl Yang</p>
            <p>Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaboratively training multimodal models across distributed clients, particularly in healthcare domains. In the context of brain imaging analysis, modality incompleteness presents a significant challenge, where some institutions may lack specific imaging modalities (e.g., PET, MRI, or CT) due to privacy concerns, device limitations, or data availability issues. While existing work typically assumes modality completeness or oversimplifies missing-modality scenarios, we simulate a more realistic setting by considering both client-level and instance-level modality incompleteness in this study. Building on this realistic simulation, we propose ClusMFL, a novel MFL framework that leverages feature clustering for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis under modality incompleteness. Specifically, ClusMFL utilizes the FINCH algorithm to construct a pool of cluster centers for the feature embeddings of each modality-label pair, effectively capturing fine-grained data distributions. These cluster centers are then used for feature alignment within each modality through supervised contrastive learning, while also acting as proxies for missing modalities, allowing cross-modal knowledge transfer. Furthermore, ClusMFL employs a modality-aware aggregation strategy, further enhancing the model's performance in scenarios with severe modality incompleteness. We evaluate the proposed framework on the ADNI dataset, utilizing structural MRI and PET scans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ClusMFL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to various baseline methods across varying levels of modality incompleteness, providing a scalable solution for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis.</p>

By training a deep network on data from an FPGA based real time simulator and then using the network s predictions to train a GMDH model, the proposed hybrid method achieves both high accuracy and design friendly simplicity. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional methods such as First Harmonic Approximation (FHA) and frequency domain corrections, particularly for wide operating ranges.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) uses the same software and hardware resources to achieve both communication and sensing functionalities. Thus, it stands as one of the core technologies of 6G and has garnered significant attention in recent years. In ISAC systems, a variety of machine learning models are trained to analyze and identify signal patterns, thereby ensuring reliable sensing and communications. However, considering factors such as communication rates, costs, and privacy, collecting sufficient training data from various ISAC scenarios for these models is impractical. Hence, this paper introduces a generative AI (GenAI) enabled robust data augmentation scheme. The scheme first employs a conditioned diffusion model trained on a limited amount of collected CSI data to generate new samples, thereby expanding the sample quantity. Building on this, the scheme further utilizes another diffusion model to enhance the sample quality, thereby facilitating the data augmentation in scenarios where the original sensing data is insufficient and unevenly distributed. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the acceleration and jerk of signal propagation path length changes from CSI. We then use the proposed scheme to enhance the estimated parameters and detect the number of targets based on the enhanced data. The evaluation reveals that our scheme improves the detection performance by up to 70%, demonstrating reliability and robustness, which supports the deployment and practical use of the ISAC network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyou Li, Tonghua Wei, Dapeng Li</p>
            <p>The explosively growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) in high-speed railway (HSR) scenario has attracted a lot of attention amongst researchers. However, limited IoT device (IoTD) batteries and large information upload latency still remain critical impediments to practical service applications. In this paper, we consider a HSR wireless mobile communication system, where two intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are deployed to help solve the problems above. Considering the carrier aggregation method, the IRS needs to be optimized globally in hybrid frequency bands. Meanwhile, to ensure information security, the transmission to the mobile communication relay (MCR) on the train is covert to passengers in the carriage by IRS. This problem is challenging to handle since the variables are coupled with each other and some tricky constraints. We firstly transform the original sum-of-ratios problem into the more tractable parametric problem. Then, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is adopted to decouple the problem into two main sub-problems, and the downlink and uplink settings are alternatively optimized using low-complexity iterative algorithms. Finally, a heuristic algorithm to mitigate the Doppler spread is proposed to further improve the performance. Simulation results corroborate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</p>

            <p>We investigate the design of pricing policies that enhance driver adherence to route guidance, ensuring effective routing control. The major novelty lies in that we adopt a Markov chain to model drivers' compliance rates conditioned on both traffic states and tolls. By formulating the managed traffic network as a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, we can quantify in a more realistic way the impacts of driver route choices and thus determine appropriate tolls. Specially, we focus on a network comprised of one corridor and one local street. We assume that a reasonable routing policy is specified in advance. However, drivers could be reluctant to be detoured. Thus a fixed toll is set on the corridor to give drivers incentives to choose the local street. We evaluate the effectiveness of the given routing and pricing policies via stability analysis. We suggest using the stability and instability conditions to establish lower and upper bounds on throughput. This allows us to select suitable tolls that maximize these bounds.</p>

            <p>The constant surge in the traffic demand on cellular networks has led to continuous expansion in network capacity in order to accommodate existing and new service demands. This has given rise to ultra-dense base station deployment in 5G and beyond networks which leads to increased energy consumption in the network. Hence, these ultra-dense base station deployments must be operated in a way that the energy consumption of the network can be adapted to the spatio-temporal traffic demands on the network in order to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. To achieve this goal, we leverage two artificial intelligence algorithms, federated learning and actor-critic algorithm, to develop a proactive and intelligent base station switching framework that can learn the operating policy of the small base station in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network (UDHN) that would result in maximum energy saving in the network while respecting the quality of service (QoS) constraints. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, characterised by low inertia and intermittent disturbances, presents substantial challenges to power system stability. As critical indicators of system stability, frequency dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena have attracted significant research attention. While existing studies predominantly employ linearized models, our findings demonstrate that linear approximations exhibit considerable errors when predicting frequency oscillation dynamics across multiple time scales, thus necessitating the incorporation of nonlinear characteristics. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on higher-order dynamical mode decomposition (HODMD) for learning frequency dynamics. The proposed method offers distinct advantages over alternative nonlinear methods, including no prior knowledge required, adaptability to high-dimensional systems, and robust performance. Furthermore, HODMD demonstrates superior capability in capturing system-wide spatio-temporal modes, successfully identifying modal behaviour that remains undetectable through standard Dynamic Mode Decomposition techniques. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive case studies on both IEEE 14-bus and WECC systems.</p>

            <p>Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. We consider the joint optimization of the spatial beam pattern and space-time correlation levels for better separating multiple targets in different angle and delay bins. In particular, we use the space-time correlation function to quantify the correlations between different angle and delay bins and formulate integrated sidelobe levels (ISLs). To serve communication users, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding to modulate information symbols, which leverages distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose a novel majorizing function for complex quadratic functions. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance the detection and estimation performance due to reduced space-time correlation levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenghong Bian, Kaitao Meng, Huihui Wu, Yumeng Zhang, Deniz Gunduz</p>
            <p>We propose a novel coded integrated passive sensing and communication (CIPSAC) system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where a multi-antenna base station (BS) passively senses the parameters of the targets and decodes the information bit sequences transmitted by a user. The transmitted signal is comprised of pilot and data OFDM symbols where the data symbols adopt cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-assisted channel codes to facilitate both the decoding and sensing procedures. In the proposed scheme, CRC not only enhances the reliability of communication but also provides guidance to the parameter sensing procedure at the BS. In particular, a novel iterative parameter sensing and channel decoding (IPSCD) algorithm is proposed, where the correctly decoded codewords that pass CRC are utilized for sensing to improve the parameter estimation accuracy, and in return, more accurate parameter estimates lead to a larger number of correctly decoded data symbols. Conventional sensing algorithms rely only on the received pilot signals, while we utilize both the data and pilot signals for sensing. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal strategy, in which the wrongly decoded data packets are replaced by zero codewords. To further improve the performance, we introduce learning-based near-orthogonal superposition (NOS) codes, which exhibit superior error correction capability especially in the short block length regime. NOS codes are trained using a weighted loss function, where a hyper parameter is introduced to balance the sensing and the communication losses. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed CIPSAC system and the IPSCD algorithm, where both the sensing and decoding performances are significantly improved with a few iterations. We also carry out extensive ablation studies for a comprehensive understanding of the proposed scheme.</p>

By identifying safe operating ranges within the excitation parameter space, this study provides practical guidance for designing robust, stable harvesters capable of maintaining cross-well motion despite parameter uncertainties.

Numerical experiments on small-to-medium-sized test systems show that while the traditional SUC approach yields a total cost of 99.05 million USD with 3.04 GWh of load curtailment, the LLM-assisted SUC (LLM-SUC) reduces costs to 98.87 million USD and lowers load curtailment to 2.32 GWh, an improvement of nearly 24%. Both methods maintain zero wind curtailment, confirming robust renewable integration. By employing an LLM agent that helps balance the energy system more effectively, the proposed framework enhances demand fulfillment at reduced costs, illustrating the potential of AI to inform generator commitments in uncertain operating conditions. Further gains may be realized by refining prompt design, incorporating historical operational data, and extending this approach to higher-dimensional uncertainties and energy storage systems, ultimately fostering greater resilience, efficiency, and adaptability in next-generation power system operations.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Quantitative MRI using Subspace Multiscale Energy Model (SS-MuSE)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Chen, Jyothi Rikhab Chand, Steven R. Kecskemeti, James H. Holmes, Mathews Jacob</p>
            <p>Multi-contrast MRI methods acquire multiple images with different contrast weightings, which are used for the differentiation of the tissue types or quantitative mapping. However, the scan time needed to acquire multiple contrasts is prohibitively long for 3D acquisition schemes, which can offer isotropic image resolution. While deep learning-based methods have been extensively used to accelerate 2D and 2D + time problems, the high memory demand, computation time, and need for large training data sets make them challenging for large-scale volumes. To address these challenges, we generalize the plug-and-play multi-scale energy-based model (MuSE) to a regularized subspace recovery setting, where we jointly regularize the 3D multi-contrast spatial factors in a subspace formulation. The explicit energy-based formulation allows us to use variable splitting optimization methods for computationally efficient recovery.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Feedback Linearization and LQG/LTR Control: A Comparative Study for a Single-Machine Infinite-Bus System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pratik Vernekar</p>
            <p>This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback linearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the linear-quadratic-Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC and INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the SMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and optimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems while remaining unaffected by the SMIB system's internal dynamics and operating conditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman filter, designed using the LTR procedure and a detailed frequency-domain loop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal performance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability margins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for constructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and nonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems by utilizing a high-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model, and the correlations between the two models' control inputs. Rigorous simulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a full-state linear-quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and trade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state error, robustness, rotor angle stability, frequency control, and voltage regulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to guide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power systems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Lou, Yijun Xu, Wei Gu</p>
            <p>In modern power systems, the integration of converter-interfaced generations requires the development of electromagnetic transient network simulation programs (EMTP) that can capture rapid fluctuations. However, as the power system scales, the EMTP's computing complexity increases exponentially, leading to a curse of dimensionality that hinders its practical application. Facing this challenge, quantum computing offers a promising approach for achieving exponential acceleration. To realize this in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, the variational quantum linear solution (VQLS) was advocated because of its robustness against depolarizing noise. However, it suffers data inflation issues in its preprocessing phase, and no prior research has applied quantum computing to high-frequency switching EMT this http URL address these issues, this paper first designs the matrix low-dimension qubit casting (MLQC) method to address the data inflation problem in the preprocessing of the admittance matrix for VQLS in EMT networks. Besides, we propose a real-only quantum circuit reduction method tailored to the characteristics of the EMT network admittance matrices. Finally, the proposed quantum EMTP algorithm (QEMTP) has been successfully verified for EMT networks containing a large number of high-frequency switching elements.</p>

            <h2>A Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning Framework for Microgrid Energy Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Vivienne Liu, Patrick M. Reed, David Gold, Garret Quist, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The emergence of microgrids (MGs) has provided a promising solution for decarbonizing and decentralizing the power grid, mitigating the challenges posed by climate change. However, MG operations often involve considering multiple objectives that represent the interests of different stakeholders, leading to potentially complex conflicts. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that explores the high-dimensional objective space and uncovers the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. This framework leverages exogenous information and capitalizes on the data-driven nature of reinforcement learning, enabling the training of a parametric policy without the need for long-term forecasts or knowledge of the underlying uncertainty distribution. The trained policies exhibit diverse, adaptive, and coordinative behaviors with the added benefit of providing interpretable insights on the dynamics of their information use. We employ this framework on the Cornell University MG (CU-MG), which is a combined heat and power MG, to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate performance improvements in all objectives considered compared to the status quo operations and offer more flexibility in navigating complex operational tradeoffs.</p>

            <h2>Reserve Provision from Electric Vehicles: Aggregate Boundaries and Stochastic Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Thrän, Jakub Mareček, Robert N. Shorten, Timothy C. Green</p>
            <p>Controlled charging of electric vehicles, EVs, is a major potential source of flexibility to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce the need for stationary energy storage. To offer system services from EVs, fleet aggregators must address the uncertainty of individual driving and charging behaviour. This paper introduces a means of forecasting the service volume available from EVs by considering several EV batteries as one conceptual battery with aggregate power and energy boundaries. Aggregation avoids the difficult prediction of individual driving behaviour. The predictability of the boundaries is demonstrated using a multiple linear regression model which achieves a normalised root mean square error of 20% - 40% for a fleet of 1,000 EVs. A two-stage stochastic model predictive control algorithm is used to schedule reserve services on a day-ahead basis addressing risk trade-offs by including Conditional Value-at-Risk in the objective function. A case study with 1.2 million domestic EV charge records from Great Britain illustrates that increasing fleet size improves prediction accuracy, thereby increasing reserve revenues and decreasing an aggregator's operational costs. For fleet sizes of 400 or above, cost reductions plateau at 60% compared to uncontrolled charging, with an average of 1.8kW of reserve provided per vehicle.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we quantify voltage and current phasor-based measurement requirements for the unique estimation of the electric grid topology and admittance parameters. Our approach is underpinned by the concept of a rigidity matrix that has been extensively studied in graph rigidity theory. Specifically, we show that the rank of the rigidity matrix is the same as that of a voltage coefficient matrix in a corresponding electric power system. Accordingly, we show that there is a minimum number of measurements required to uniquely estimate the admittance matrix and corresponding grid topology. By means of a numerical example on the IEEE 4-node radial network, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for applications in electric power grids.</p>

            <p>The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ángel F. García-Fernández, Simo Särkkä</p>
            <p>This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyuan Jiang, Constantino M. Lagoa, Yan Li</p>
            <p>Transient stability is crucial to the reliable operation of power systems. Existing theories rely on the simplified electromechanical models, substituting the detailed electromagnetic dynamics of inductor and capacitor with their impedance representations. However, this simplification is inadequate for the growing penetration of fast-switching power electronic devices. Attempts to extend the existing theories to include electromagnetic dynamics lead to overly conservative stability conditions. To tackle this problem more directly, we study the condition under which the power source and dissipation in the electromagnetic dynamics tend to balance each other asymptotically. This is equivalent to the convergence of the Hamiltonian (total stored energy) and can be shown to imply transient stability. Using contraction analysis, we prove that this property holds for a large class of time-varying port-Hamiltonian systems with (i) constant damping matrix and (ii) strictly convex Hamiltonian. Then through port-Hamiltonian modeling of the electromagnetic dynamics, we obtain that the synchronized steady state of the power system is globally stable if it exists. This result provides new insights into the reliable operation of power systems. The proposed theory is illustrated in the simulation results of a two-machine system.</p>

            <p>The urgent energy transition requirements towards a sustainable future stretch across various industries and are a significant challenge facing humanity. Hydrogen promises a clean, carbon-free future, with the opportunity to integrate with existing solutions in the transportation sector. However, adding hydrogen to existing technologies such as diesel engines requires additional modeling effort. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables interactive data-driven learning that eliminates the need for mathematical modeling. The algorithms, however, may not be real-time capable and need large amounts of data to work in practice. This paper presents a novel approach which uses offline model learning with RL to demonstrate safe control of a 4.5 L Hydrogen Diesel Dual-Fuel (H2DF) engine. The controllers are demonstrated to be constraint compliant and can leverage a novel state-augmentation approach for sample-efficient learning. The offline policy is subsequently experimentally validated on the real engine where the control algorithm is executed on a Raspberry Pi controller and requires 6 times less computation time compared to online Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Rodrigues de Brito, Daniel Simon Baltensperger, Kjetil Obstfelder Uhlen</p>
            <p>This work presents a framework for dynamic performance assessment of the higher layers in the hierarchical voltage regulation scheme, with case studies applied to specific areas of the Norwegian grid. Unlike the primary (PVR) level, the secondary (SVR) and tertiary (TVR) levels are not tuned to a single device at a time, handling instead several reactive power resources available within a control zone including generator units, static VAr compensators and others. Proper SVR-TVR coordination for realistic transmission systems is a challenging topic at the core of many ongoing discussions in voltage control literature. Special focus is placed on practical considerations from the system operator perspective, since this research is also aimed at simplifying daily control centre routines. Dynamic simulation results concern a 21-bus equivalent of a 132 kV network model that accurately represents a Norwegian grid subsystem. Case studies address daily grid operation with real-life load demand and wind power generation profiles, showing that the proposed strategy is effective not only to minimize total active power losses as much as possible within system-wide limitations, but also to maintain adequate voltage profiles and reactive power flows. Findings pertaining to this work showcase the benefits of applying hierarchical voltage regulation layers as an asset to day-to-day control center management of a realistic transmission network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo Gan, Li Junhui, Mu Gang, Yan Gangui</p>
            <p>Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are essential for peak shaving, balancing power supply and demand while enhancing grid efficiency. This study proposes a cycle-based control strategy for charging and discharging, which optimizes capture rate (CR), release rate (RR), and capacity utilization rate (CUR), improving BESS performance. Compared to traditional day-ahead methods, the cycle-based approach enhances operational accuracy and reduces capacity waste, achieving a CUR increase from 75.1% to 79.9%. An innovative cluster-level power allocation method, leveraging an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, is introduced. This strategy reduces daily energy loss by 174.21 kWh (3.7%) and increases BESS efficiency by 0.4%. Transient and steady-state energy loss components are analyzed, revealing that transient loss proportion decreases significantly as power depth increases, from 27.2% at 1 MW to 1.3% at 10 MW. Simulations based on a detailed Simulink/Simscape model validate these methods, demonstrating enhanced peak shaving effectiveness and prolonged BESS lifespan by reducing equivalent cycles. The study provides a robust framework for optimizing BESS performance and efficiency in real-world applications.</p>

            <p>In response to increasing grid congestion in the Netherlands, non-firm connection and transport agreements (CTAs) and capacity restriction contracts (CRCs) have been introduced, allowing consumer curtailment in exchange for grid tariff discounts or per-MW compensations. This study examines the interaction between an electrolyzer project, facing sizing and contracting decisions, and a network operator, responsible for contract activations and determining grid connection capacity, under the new Dutch regulations. The interaction is modeled using two bilevel optimization problems with alternating leader-follower roles. Results highlight a trade-off between CRC income and non-firm CTA tariff discounts, showing that voluntary congestion management by the network operator increases electrolyzer profitability at CRC prices below 10 euro per MW but reduces it at higher prices. Furthermore, the network operator benefits more from reacting to the electrolyzer owner's CTA decisions than from leading the interaction at CRC prices above 10 euro per MW. Ignoring the other party's optimization problem overestimates profits for both the network operator and the electrolyzer owner, emphasizing the importance of coordinated decision-making.</p>

            <p>Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</p>

            <p>The integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids introduces significant operational challenges due to their intermittent nature and the mismatch between generation and demand patterns. Effective demand response (DR) strategies are crucial for maintaining system stability and economic efficiency, particularly in microgrids with high renewable penetration.

The framework incorporates load classification, dynamic price thresholding, and multi-period coordination for optimal DR event scheduling. Analysis across seven distinct operational scenarios demonstrates consistent peak load reduction of 10\% while achieving energy cost savings ranging from 13.1\% to 38.0\%. The highest performance was observed in scenarios with high solar generation, where the framework achieved 38.0\% energy cost reduction through optimal coordination of renewable resources and DR actions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Nguyen, Phuong Nguyen, Koen Kok</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the distribution system has led to the emergence of a new market actor - the aggregator. The aggregator serves as a facilitator, enabling flexibility asset owners to get access to different markets. In which, EVs aggregators are gaining more attention due to their expanding use and potential to provide services in various types of markets, particularly in the reserve market. Currently, TSO indirectly utilizes these resources under the management of the distribution system operators (DSO), which can negatively impact the distribution grid. Conversely, adjustments from DSOs can impact service provision to TSO due to the shortage of TSO usage information. These factors highlight the importance of evaluating the service provision from aggregators under different TSO-DSO coordination schemes. This paper focuses on the provision of flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs) aggregators for balancing service in the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed and compares it with the DSO-managed coordination schemes. The behavior of aggregators reacting to price fluctuations and TSO requests under different coordination schemes and simulation scenarios is thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, their impact on the grid is analyzed through the DSO's congestion management process and validated using data from a real part of the Dutch distribution network. Results find that the hybrid-managed coordination scheme gives more benefit to the aggregator than the DSO-managed scheme and the EVs aggregator will gain more profit in winter than summer due to more upward regulation service is needed.</p>

            <p>Fair cost allocation in community microgrids remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between multiple participants with varying load profiles, distributed energy resources, and storage systems. Traditional cost allocation methods often fail to adequately address the dynamic nature of participant contributions and benefits, leading to inequitable distribution of costs and reduced participant satisfaction. This paper presents a novel framework integrating multi-objective optimization with cooperative game theory for fair and efficient microgrid operation and cost allocation. The proposed approach combines mixed-integer linear programming for optimal resource dispatch with Shapley value analysis for equitable benefit distribution, ensuring both system efficiency and participant satisfaction. The framework was validated using real-world data across six distinct operational scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both technical and economic performance. Results show peak demand reductions ranging from 7.8% to 62.6%, solar utilization rates reaching 114.8% through effective storage integration, and cooperative gains of up to $1,801.01 per day. The Shapley value-based allocation achieved balanced benefit-cost distributions, with net positions ranging from -16.0% to +14.2% across different load categories, ensuring sustainable participant cooperation.</p>

            <p>Microgrids (MGs) play a crucial role in utilizing distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar and wind power, enhancing the sustainability and flexibility of modern power systems. However, the inherent variability in MG topology, power flow, and DER operating modes poses significant challenges to the accurate system identification of MGs, which is crucial for designing robust control strategies and ensuring MG stability. This paper proposes a Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (PC-SINDy) method for accurate MG system identification. By leveraging an analytically derived library of candidate functions, PC-SINDy extracts accurate dynamic models using only phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Simulations on a 4-bus system demonstrate that PC-SINDy can reliably and accurately predict frequency trajectories under large disturbances, including scenarios not encountered during the identification/training phase, even when using noisy, low-sampled PMU data.</p>

Also, while the runtime of the proposed method is in the range of the self-consumption maximization (SCM) approach as the fastest method, its electricity cost is about 3.2% cheaper than the SCM method. Simulation results also show that in case of providing grid services by the battery the difference between electricity cost of the proposed approach and MPC can reduce which makes the method good for such applications.</p>

            <h2>Design and Implementation of Scalable Communication Interfaces for Reliable and Stable Real-time Co-Simulation of Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Xiao, Jongha Woo, Lidong Song, Ning Lu, Victor Paduani</p>
            <p>Co-simulation offers an integrated approach for modeling the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into transmission and distribution grids. This paper presents a scalable communication interface design and implementation to enable reliable and stable real-time co-simulation of power systems with high IBR penetration. The communication interface is categorized into two types: local and remote. In local scenarios, where subsystems are connected within a single local area network (LAN), low-latency communication facilitates the seamless integration of electromagnetic transient (EMT) and phasor-domain models, enabling efficient interactions with power and energy management algorithms. For remote scenarios, data exchange is achieved via internet-based file sharing or VPN-enabled communication. The performance of both methods is evaluated using OPAL-RT as a real-time simulator, demonstrating scalability, effectiveness, and challenges specific to real-time co-simulation applications. To mitigate instability arising from data resolution mismatches in time-sensitive co-simulations, a real-time data extrapolation method is proposed. This approach significantly enhances stability and reliability, ensuring more accurate simulation outcomes. The implementation code is available on GitHub, providing researchers the tools to replicate and expand upon this work.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Load Forecasting with GAT-LSTM: Leveraging Grid and Temporal Features</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ugochukwu Orji, Çiçek Güven, Dan Stowell</p>
            <p>Accurate power load forecasting is essential for the efficient operation and planning of electrical grids, particularly given the increased variability and complexity introduced by renewable energy sources. This paper introduces GAT-LSTM, a hybrid model that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A key innovation of the model is the incorporation of edge attributes, such as line capacities and efficiencies, into the attention mechanism, enabling it to dynamically capture spatial relationships grounded in grid-specific physical and operational constraints. Additionally, by employing an early fusion of spatial graph embeddings and temporal sequence features, the model effectively learns and predicts complex interactions between spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, providing a realistic representation of the dynamics of power grids. Experimental evaluations on the Brazilian Electricity System dataset demonstrate that the GAT-LSTM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving reductions of 21. 8% in MAE, 15. 9% in RMSE and 20. 2% in MAPE. These results underscore the robustness and adaptability of the GAT-LSTM model, establishing it as a powerful tool for applications in grid management and energy planning.</p>

            <h2>Graph-based Simulation Framework for Power Resilience Estimation and Enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuesong Wang, Shuo Yuan, Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Caisheng Wang, Le Yi Wang</p>
            <p>The increasing frequency of extreme weather events poses significant risks to power distribution systems, leading to widespread outages and severe economic and social consequences. This paper presents a novel simulation framework for assessing and enhancing the resilience of power distribution networks under such conditions. Resilience is estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, which simulate extreme weather scenarios and evaluate the impact on infrastructure fragility. Due to the proprietary nature of power network topology, a distribution network is synthesized using publicly available data. To generate the weather scenarios, an extreme weather generation method is developed. To enhance resilience, renewable resources such as solar panels and energy storage systems (batteries in this study) are incorporated. A customized Genetic Algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal locations and capacities for solar panels and battery installations, maximizing resilience while balancing cost constraints. Experiment results demonstrate that on a large-scale synthetic distribution network with more than 300,000 nodes and 300,000 edges, the proposed framework can efficiently evaluate the resilience, and enhance the resilience through the installations of distributed energy resources (DERs), providing utilities with valuable insights for community-level power system resilience estimation and enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Multiple-Target Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Elfiatoure, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Hyundong Shin, Michail Matthaiou</p>
            <p>We propose a distributed implementation for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) backed by a massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) architecture without cells. Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs.</p>

            <h2>Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You</p>
            <p>The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</p>

            <h2>Real-time Optimization for Wind-to-H2 Driven Critical Infrastructures Based on Active Constraints Identification and Integer Variables Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Goodarzi, Qifeng Li</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a concept of wind-to-hydrogen-driven critical infrastructure (W2H-CI) as an engineering solution for decarbonizing the power generation sector where it utilizes wind power to produce hydrogen through electrolysis and combines it with the carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants. First, a convex mathematical model of W2H-CI is developed. Then, an optimization model for optimal operation of W2H-CI, which is a large-scale mixed-integer convex program (MICP), is proposed. Moreover, we propose to solve this problem in real-time in order to hedge against the uncertainty of wind power. For this purpose, a novel solution method based on active constraints identification and integer variable prediction is introduced. This method can solve MICP problems very fast since it uses historical optimization data to predict the values of binary variables and a limited number of constraints which most likely contain all active constraints. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed fast solution method using two W2H-CI case studies.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Steady-State Secondary Control of MT-HVdc Grids with Reduced Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Abdolmaleki, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a centralized secondary control for the real-time steady-state optimization of multi-terminal HVdc grids under voltage and current limits. First, we present the dynamic models of the grid components, including the modular multilevel converter (MMC) stations and their different control layers. We also derive the quasi-static input-output model of the system, which is suitable for the steady-state control design. Second, we formulate a general optimization problem using this quasi-static model and find the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of its solutions. Third, we propose a secondary control based on primal-dual dynamics to adjust the voltage setpoints of the dispatchable MMCs, with which the system asymptotically converges to a steady state that satisfies these optimality conditions. Fourth, we provide a communication triggering mechanism to reduce the communication traffic between the secondary control unit and the MMC stations. Finally, we verify our proposal for different case studies by adapting it to an offshore multi-terminal HVdc grid composed of heterogeneous MMC stations simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The problems of proportional current minimization and loss reduction are two special case studies.</p>

            <p>The uncertainty of the sensing target brings great challenge to the beamforming design of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To address this issue, we model the scattering coefficient and azimuth angle of the target as random variables and introduce a novel metric, expected detection probability (EPd), to quantify the average detection performance from a Bayesian perspective. Furthermore, we design a Bayesian beamforming scheme to optimize the expected detection probability under the limited power budget and communication performance constraints. A successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation-based (SCA-SDR) algorithm is developed for the complicated non-convex optimization problem corresponding to the beamforming scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other benchmarks and exhibits robust detection performance when parameters of the target are unknown and random.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Recurrent Network for Gas Pipeline Network Parameters Identification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Wenchuan Wu, Chenhui Lin, Qi Wang, Shuwei Xu, Binbin Chen</p>
            <p>As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can provide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal dispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal operation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of accurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the mathematical models of such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network (PIRN) model to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. The approach combines data-driven learning from measurement data with the fluid dynamics described by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical state-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification is transformed into a training process for a PIRN. Similar to standard recurrent neural networks, this model can be implemented using the PyTorch framework and trained via backpropagation. Case studies demonstrate that our method accurately estimates gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node measurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter efficiency. Furthermore, the identified models can be seamlessly integrated into optimization frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning for Scalable and Optimal Load Shedding Under Power System Contingency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Zhou, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>Prompt and effective corrective actions in response to unexpected contingencies are crucial for improving power system resilience and preventing cascading blackouts. The optimal load shedding (OLS) accounting for network limits has the potential to address the diverse system-wide impacts of contingency scenarios as compared to traditional local schemes. However, due to the fast cascading propagation of initial contingencies, real-time OLS solutions are challenging to attain in large systems with high computation and communication needs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized design that leverages offline training of a neural network (NN) model for individual load centers to autonomously construct the OLS solutions from locally available measurements. Our learning-for-OLS approach can greatly reduce the computation and communication needs during online emergency responses, thus preventing the cascading propagation of contingencies for enhanced power grid resilience. Numerical studies on both the IEEE 118-bus system and a synthetic Texas 2000-bus system have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our scalable OLS learning design for timely power system emergency operations.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Configuration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces With Non-uniform Phase Quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialong Lu, Rujing Xiong, Tiebin Mi, Ke Yin, Robert Caiming Qiu</p>
            <p>The existing methods for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) beamforming in wireless communications are typically limited to uniform phase quantization. However, in practical applications, engineering challenges and design requirements often lead to non-uniform phase and bit resolution of RIS units, which limits the performance potential of these methods. To address this issue, this paper pioneers the study of discrete non-uniform phase configuration in RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication and formulates an optimization model to characterize the problem. For single-user scenarios, the paper proposes a partition-andtraversal (PAT) algorithm that efficiently achieves the global optimal solution through systematic search and traversal. For larger-scale multi-user scenarios, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity, an enhanced PAT-based algorithm (E-PAT) is developed. By optimizing the search strategy, the E-PAT algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves linear complexity. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PAT and EPAT algorithms. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the impact of non-uniform phase quantization on system performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuangkun Wei, Wenxiu Hu, Yathreb Bouazizi, Mengbang Zou, Chenguang Liu, Yunfei Chen, Hongjian Sun, Julie McCann</p>
            <p>Coordinated controlling a large UAV swarm requires significant spectrum resources due to the need for bandwidth allocation per UAV, posing a challenge in resource-limited environments. Over-the-air (OTA) control has emerged as a spectrum-efficient approach, leveraging electromagnetic superposition to form control signals at a base station (BS). However, existing OTA controllers lack sufficient optimization variables to meet UAV swarm control objectives and fail to integrate control with other BS functions like sensing. This work proposes an integrated sensing and OTA control framework (ISAC-OTA) for UAV swarm. The BS performs OTA signal construction (uplink) and dispatch (downlink) while simultaneously sensing objects. Two uplink post-processing methods are developed: a control-centric approach generating closed-form control signals via a feedback-looped OTA control problem, and a sensing-centric method mitigating transmission-induced interference for accurate object sensing. For the downlink, a non-convex problem is formulated and solved to minimize control signal dispatch (transmission) error while maintaining a minimum sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that the proposed ISAC-OTA controller achieves control performance comparable to the benchmark optimal control algorithm while maintaining high sensing accuracy, despite OTA transmission interference. Moreover, it eliminates the need for per-UAV bandwidth allocation, showcasing a spectrum-efficient method for cooperative control in future wireless systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boqun Zhao, Chongjun Ouyang, Xingqi Zhang, Hyundong Shin, Yuanwei Liu</p>
            <p>A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. Within this framework, continuous operator-based signal models are employed to describe the sensing and communication processes. The performance of communication and sensing is analyzed using two information-theoretic metrics: the communication rate (CR) and the sensing rate (SR). 1) For downlink ISAC, three continuous beamforming designs are proposed: i) the communications-centric (C-C) design that maximizes the CR, ii) the sensing-centric (S-C) design that maximizes the SR, and iii) the Pareto-optimal design that characterizes the Pareto boundary of the CR-SR region. A signal subspace-based approach is proposed to derive the closed-form optimal beamformers for the considered designs. On this basis, closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable CRs and SRs, and the downlink rate region achieved by CAPAs is characterized. 2) For uplink ISAC, the C-C and S-C successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based methods are proposed to manage inter-functionality interference. Using the subspace approach along with the time-sharing technique, closed-form expressions for the optimal beamformers are derived, and the achievable CRs, SRs, and rate region are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that, for both downlink and uplink, CAPA-based ISAC achieves higher CRs and SRs as well as larger CR-SR regions compared to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-based ISAC.</p>

Our experiments on IEEE test systems show that GNNs can accurately predict power flow solutions and scale to larger systems, outperforming traditional solvers in terms of computation time. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for real-time power grid management, with future plans to apply the model to even larger grid systems.</p>

            <p>The cooperative operation of grid-edge power and energy resources is crucial to improving the resilience of power systems during contingencies. However, given the complex cyber-physical nature of power grids, it is hard to respond timely with limited costs for deploying additional cyber and/or phyiscal resources, such as during a high-impact low-frequency cyber-physical event. Therefore, the paper examines the design of cooperative cyber-physical resource optimization solutions to control grid-tied cyber and physical resources. First, the operation of a cyber-physical power system is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, including the cyber and physical objectives and constraints. Then, a bi-level solution is provided to obtain optimal cyber and physical actions, including the reconfiguration of cyber topology (e.g., activation of communication links) in the cyber layer and the control of physical resources (e.g., energy storage systems) in the physical layer. The developed method improves grid resilience during cyberattacks and can provide guidance on the control of coupled physical side resources. Numerical simulation on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p>This paper puts forward the vision of creating a library of neural-network-based models for power system simulations. Traditional numerical solvers struggle with the growing complexity of modern power systems, necessitating faster and more scalable alternatives. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer promise to solve fast the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing power system dynamics. This is vital for the reliability, cost optimization, and real-time decision-making in the electricity grid. Despite their potential, standardized frameworks to train PINNs remain scarce. This poses a barrier for the broader adoption and reproducibility of PINNs; it also does not allow the streamlined creation of a PINN-based model library. This paper addresses these gaps. It introduces a Python-based toolbox for developing PINNs tailored to power system components, available on GitHub https://github. com/radiakos/PowerPINN. Using this framework, we capture the dynamic characteristics of a 9th-order system, which is probably the most complex power system component trained with a PINN to date, demonstrating the toolbox capabilities, limitations, and potential improvements.

            <p>The introduction of intelligent interconnectivity between the physical and human worlds has attracted great attention for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, emphasizing massive capacity, ultra-low latency, and unparalleled reliability. Wireless distributed networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), both of which have evolved from centralized paradigms, are two promising solutions for the great attention. Given their distinct capabilities, such as decentralization and collaborative mechanisms, integrating these two paradigms holds great promise for unleashing the full power of 6G, attracting significant research and development attention. This paper provides a comprehensive study on MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks for 6G. In particular, we introduce the basic mathematical background and evolution of wireless distributed networks and MARL, as well as demonstrate their interrelationships. Subsequently, we analyze different structures of wireless distributed networks from the perspectives of homogeneous and heterogeneous. Furthermore, we introduce the basic concepts of MARL and discuss two typical categories, including model-based and model-free. We then present critical challenges faced by MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks, providing important guidance and insights for actual implementation. We also explore an interplay between MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks and emerging techniques, such as information bottleneck and mirror learning, delivering in-depth analyses and application scenarios. Finally, we outline several compelling research directions for future MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks.</p>

The approach uses multidirectional, widely distributed currents on conductive surfaces that are placed around the target volume. It generates multiple, mutually unique, three-dimensional magnetic field patterns, where each pattern is attributed to different eigenmodes of a single room-scale resonator. Using these modes together, a power delivery efficiency exceeding 37.1% can be achieved throughout a 3 m * 3 m * 2 m test room. With this approach, power exceeding 50 W could potentially be delivered to mobile receivers in accordance with safety guidelines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Takuya Kiyokawa, Weiwei Wan, Kensuke Harada</p>
            <p>Robotic grasping is facing a variety of real-world uncertainties caused by non-static object states, unknown object properties, and cluttered object arrangements. The difficulty of grasping increases with the presence of more uncertainties, where commonly used learning-based approaches struggle to perform consistently across varying conditions. In this study, we integrate the idea of similarity matching to tackle the challenge of grasping novel objects that are simultaneously in motion and densely cluttered using a single RGBD camera, where multiple uncertainties coexist. We achieve this by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic scenes. Notably, we introduce optimization methods to enhance planning efficiency for this time-sensitive task. Our proposed system can adapt to various object types, arrangements and movement speeds without the need for extensive training, as demonstrated by real-world experiments.</p>

            <h2>An adaptive filter bank based neural network approach for time delay estimation and speech enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Ma</p>
            <p>Time delay estimation (TDE) plays a key role in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) using adaptive filter method. Considerable residual echo will be left if estimation error arises. Here, in this paper, we proposed an adaptive filter bank based neural network approach where the delay is estimated by a bank of adaptive filters with overlapped time scope, and all the energy of filter weights are concatenated and feed to a classification network. The index with maximal probability is chosen as the estimated delay. Based on this TDE, an AEC scheme is designed using a neural network for residual echo and noise suppression, and the optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA) algorithm is adopted to make it robust. Also, a robust automatic gain control (AGC) scheme with spectrum smoothing method is designed to amplify speech segments. Performance evaluations reveal that higher performance can be achieved for our scheme.</p>

            <h2>Platelet Inventory Management with Approximate Dynamic Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Abouee-Mehrizi, Mahdi Mirjalili, Vahid Sarhangian</p>
            <p>We study a stochastic perishable inventory control problem with endogenous (decision-dependent) uncertainty in shelf-life of units. Our primary motivation is determining ordering policies for blood platelets. Determining optimal ordering quantities is a challenging task due to the short maximum shelf-life of platelets (3-5 days after testing) and high uncertainty in daily demand. We formulate the problem as an infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP). The model captures salient features observed in our data from a network of Canadian hospitals and allows for fixed ordering costs. We show that with uncertainty in shelf-life, the value function of the MDP is non-convex and key structural properties valid under deterministic shelf-life no longer hold. Hence, we propose an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm to find approximate policies. We approximate the value function using a linear combination of basis functions and tune the parameters using a simulation-based policy iteration algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy using extensive numerical experiments in parameter regimes relevant to the platelet inventory management problem. We further leverage the ADP algorithm to evaluate the impact of ignoring shelf-life uncertainty. Finally, we evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the ADP algorithm in a case study using real data and compare it to the historical hospital performance and other benchmarks. The ADP policy can be computed online in a few minutes and results in more than 50% lower expiry and shortage rates compared to the historical performance. In addition, it performs better or as well as an exact policy that ignores uncertainty in shelf-life and becomes hard to compute for larger instance of the problem.</p>

            <h2>Infinite-horizon optimal scheduling for feedback control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyi Wang, Sandra Hirche</p>
            <p>Emerging cyber-physical systems impel the development of communication protocols that optimize resource utilization. This article investigates infinite-horizon optimal scheduling for resource-aware networked control systems by addressing the rate-regulation tradeoff. Consider a scenario where the sensor and the controller communicate via a networked channel, the transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process on unbounded general state space controlled by scheduling decisions. The value of information (VoI) serves as a metric to assess the importance of sensory data for transmission. We derive the optimal scheduling law for feedback control based on VoI and show that it is deterministic and stationary, with an explicit expression obtained via value iteration. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling law is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the dynamic behavior of the iteration process, we show that the VoI function and the optimal scheduling law exhibit symmetry. Furthermore, when the system matrix is diagonalizable, the VoI function is monotone and quasi-convex. Consequently, the optimal scheduling law is shown to exhibit a threshold structure and takes a quadratic form, with the threshold region explicitly characterized. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Shan Zuo</p>
            <p>The problem of asymmetric bipartite consensus control is investigated within the context of nonlinear, discrete-time, networked multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To address the challenges posed by these aperiodic DoS attacks, a data-driven event-triggered (DDET) mechanism has been developed. This mechanism is specifically designed to synchronize the states of the follower agents with the leader's state, even in the face of aperiodic communication disruptions and data losses. Given the constraints of unavailable agents' states and data packet loss during these attacks, the DDET control framework resiliently achieves leader-follower consensus. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two numerical examples, which showcase its ability to adeptly handle the complexities arising from aperiodic DoS attacks in nonlinear MAS settings.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Incentive Selection for Hierarchical Convex Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Thirugnanam, Koushil Sreenath</p>
            <p>In this paper, we discuss incentive design for hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) systems viewed as Stackelberg games. We consider a hierarchical MPC formulation where, given a lower-level convex MPC (LoMPC), the upper-level system solves a bilevel MPC (BiMPC) subject to the constraint that the lower-level system inputs are optimal for the LoMPC. Such hierarchical problems are challenging due to optimality constraints in the BiMPC formulation. We analyze an incentive Stackelberg game variation of the problem, where the BiMPC provides additional incentives for the LoMPC cost function, which grants the BiMPC influence over the LoMPC inputs. We show that for such problems, the BiMPC can be reformulated as a simpler optimization problem, and the optimal incentives can be iteratively computed without knowing the LoMPC cost function. We extend our formulation for the case of multiple LoMPCs and propose an algorithm that finds bounded suboptimal solutions for the BiMPC. We demonstrate our algorithm for a dynamic price control example, where an independent system operator (ISO) sets the electricity prices for electric vehicle (EV) charging with the goal of minimizing a social cost and satisfying electricity generation constraints. Notably, our method scales well to large EV population sizes.</p>

            <p>We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple antennas serve as distributed UAV-access points (UAV-APs). These UAV-APs provide seamless coverage by jointly serving user equipments (UEs) with out predefined cell boundaries. However, high-capacity wireless networks face significant challenges due to fronthaul limitations in UAV-assisted architectures. This letter proposes a novel UAV-based cell-free mMIMO framework that leverages distributed UAV-APs to serve UEs while addressing the capacity constraints of wireless fronthaul links. We evaluate functional split Options 7.2 and 8 for the fronthaul links, aiming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the UEs and minimize the power consumption by optimizing the transmit powers of UAV-APs and selectively activating them. Our analysis compares sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for the fronthaul, showing that mmWave achieves superior SINR with lower power consumption, particularly under Option 8. Additionally, we determine the minimum fronthaul bandwidth required to activate a single UAV-AP under different split options.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meiding Liu, Zhengchun Zhou, Qiao Shi, Guyue Li, Zilong Liu, Pingzhi Fan, Inkyu Lee</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the physical layer security (PLS) problem for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the presence of hybrid-colluding eavesdroppers, where an active eavesdropper (AE) and a passive eavesdropper (PE) collude to intercept the confidential information. To ensure the accuracy of sensing while preventing the eavesdropping, a base station transmits a signal consisting of information symbols and sensing waveform, in which the sensing waveform can be also used as artificial noise to interfere with eavesdroppers. Under this setup, we propose an alternating optimization-based two stage scheme (AO-TSS) for improving the sensing and communication performance. In the first stage, based on the assumptions that the perfect channel state information (CSI) of the AE and statistical CSI of the PE are known, the communication and sensing beamforming problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the beampattern matching mean squared error (MSE) and cross-correlation, subject to the secure transmission constraint. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithm and a reduced-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm. Then, the scenarios are further extended to more general cases with imperfect AE CSI and unknown PE CSI. To further improve the communication performance, the second-stage problem is developed to optimize the secrecy rate threshold under the radar performance constraint. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of sensing and secure communication.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme. The controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Furthermore, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with parametrized NMPC as function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Shimane, Stefano Di Cairano, Koki Ho, Avishai Weiss</p>
            <p>We develop a model predictive control (MPC) policy for station-keeping (SK) on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed policy achieves full-state tracking of a reference NRHO via a two-maneuver control horizon placed one revolution apart. Our method abides by the typical mission requirement that at most one maneuver is used for SK during each NRHO revolution. Simultaneously, the policy has sufficient controllability for full-state tracking, making it immune to phase deviation issues in the along-track direction of the reference NRHO, a common drawback of existing SK methods with a single maneuver per revolution. We report numerical simulations with a navigation filter to demonstrate the MPC's performance with output feedback. Our approach successfully maintains the spacecraft's motion in the vicinity of the reference in both space and phase, with tighter tracking than state-of-the-art SK methods and comparable delta-V performance.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Use of Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles for Supporting Power Grid Operations</h2>

            <p>This paper explores the use of autonomous unmanned vehicles to support power grid operations. With built-in batteries and the capability to carry additional battery energy storage, the rising number of autonomous vehicles can represent a substantial amount of capacity that is currently underutilized in the power grid. Unlike traditional electric vehicles that require drivers, the operations of autonomous vehicles can be performed without human intervention. To guide idle vehicles to autonomously support power grids, we propose a tractable optimization-based method to effectively integrate these "mobile batteries" into grid operations. During real-time operations, the vehicles are strategically routed to target locations to maintain power balance and reduce operating costs. Numerical studies have confirmed both the validity and the scalability of the proposed algorithm to efficiently integrate autonomous vehicles into routine power system operations.</p>

            <p>Due to the fundamental transition to a power electronic dominated power system, the increasing diversity of dynamic elements underscores the need to assess their similarity to mature electrical engineering models. This article addresses the concept of the Dynamic Similarity Index (DSI) for its use in, power electronics-dominated networks. The DSI is a multipurpose tool developed to be used by different stakeholders (e.g., converter manufacturers and system operators). Such an index is calculated per frequency, which serves to anticipate potential differences in particular frequency ranges of interest between the model under study and the reference model. Within the scope of this study, the dynamic similarity of inverter-based generators to an ideal voltage source behind an impedance is assessed, due to the relevance of this fundamental circuit in the representation of generation units in power system studies. The article presents two potential applications based on this mathematical framework. First, for manufacturers to evaluate control performance compared to a reference model and second, it enables operators to diagnose buses with voltage vulnerability based on a user-defined reference Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) value. The DSI results for these two case studies are validated using Matlab Simulink simulations.</p>

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these bottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems: single-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and ELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review the associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature.

            <p>We propose a market designed using game theory to optimally utilize the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible loads. Market agents perform multiperiod optimization to determine their feasible flexibility limits for power injections while satisfying all constraints of their DERs. This is followed by a Stackelberg game between the market operator and agents. The market operator as the leader aims to regulate the aggregate power injection around a desired value by leveraging the flexibility of their agents, and computes optimal prices for both electricity and flexibility services. The agents follow by optimally bidding their desired flexible power injections in response to these prices. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium among all the agents and a Stackelberg equilibrium between all agents and the operator. In addition to deriving analytical closed-form solutions, we provide simulation results for a small example system to illustrate our approach.</p>

            <p>Residential electrification - replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric machines - can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, installing electric appliances or vehicle charging in a residential building can sharply increase its current draws. In older housing, high current draws can jeopardize electrical infrastructure, such as circuit breaker panels or electrical service (the wires that connect a building to the distribution grid). Upgrading electrical infrastructure can entail long delays and high costs, so poses a significant barrier to electrification. This paper develops and field-tests a control system that avoids the need for electrical upgrades by keeping an electrified home's total current draw within the safe limits of its panel and service. In the proposed control architecture, a high-level controller plans device set-points over a rolling prediction horizon. A low-level controller monitors real-time conditions and ramps down devices if necessary. The control system was tested in an occupied, electrified single-family house with code-minimum insulation, an air-to-air heat pump and backup resistance heat, a resistance water heater, and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with Level I charging. The field tests spanned 31 winter days with outdoor temperatures as low as -20 C. The control system maintained the whole-home current within the safe limits of electrical panels and service rated at 100 A, a common rating for older houses in North America, by adjusting only the temperature set-points of the heat pump and water heater. Simulations suggest that the same 100 A limit could accommodate a second electric vehicle with Level II charging. The proposed control system could allow older homes to safely electrify without upgrading electrical panels or service, saving a typical household on the order of $2,000 to $10,000.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Thrän, Tim C. Green, Robert Shorten</p>
            <p>To make well-informed investment decisions, energy system stakeholders require reliable cost frameworks for demand response (DR) and storage technologies. While the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) permits comprehensive cost comparisons between different storage technologies, no generic cost measure for the comparison of different DR schemes exists. This paper introduces the levelised cost of demand response (LCODR) which is an analogous measure to the LCOS but crucially differs from it by considering consumer reward payments. Additionally, the value factor from cost estimations of variable renewable energy is adapted to account for the variable availability of DR. The LCODRs for four direct load control (DLC) schemes and twelve storage applications are estimated and contrasted against LCOS literature values for the most competitive storage technologies. The DLC schemes are vehicle-to-grid, smart charging, smart heat pumps, and heat pumps with thermal storage. The results show that only heat pumps with thermal storage consistently outcompete storage technologies with EV-based DR schemes being competitive for some applications. The results and the underlying methodology offer a tool for energy system stakeholders to assess the competitiveness of DR schemes even with limited user data.</p>

The problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer semidefinite program and effectively solved using off-the-shelf numerical solvers. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach by benchmarking its performance in phasor measurement unit placement in comparison to greedy algorithms.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</p>

            <p>In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line switching actions. Several tree partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Edge Speech Understanding with Tiny Foundation Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsara Benazir, Felix Xiaozhu Lin</p>
            <p>Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce XYZ, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of XYZ hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement XYZ on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. XYZ with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. XYZ is 16x smaller in memory and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Malmer, Arvid Rolander, Emil Hillberg, Olof Samuelsson, Susanne Ackeby, Lars Nordström</p>
            <p>To increase the utilisation rate of the power system and accelerate electrification while providing a high degree of security and reliability, System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) are of great importance. SIPS functions are automatic remedial actions, detecting abnormal conditions or contingencies in the system and taking control action to mitigate these conditions. Design, implementation, maintenance and coordination of SIPS are all important aspects for desired operation. However, different actors have chosen different approaches to using SIPS for capacity enhancement, and there are discrepancies in how capacity is valued in relation to for example complexity, reliability and risk. Additionally, definitions often vary between countries. This paper reports on a joint survey and interview study on SIPS with stakeholders and experts in the Nordic countries - including TSOs, DSOs and industry. Combined with a literature review, a comparison and analysis of how SIPS are used in the Nordics is performed, particularly in relation to ENTSO-E capacity allocation.</p>

            <h2>Improving Power Plant CO2 Emission Estimation with Deep Learning and Satellite/Simulated Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dibyabha Deb, Kamal Das</p>
            <p>CO2 emissions from power plants, as significant super emitters, contribute substantially to global warming. Accurate quantification of these emissions is crucial for effective climate mitigation strategies. While satellite-based plume inversion offers a promising approach, challenges arise from data limitations and the complexity of atmospheric conditions. This study addresses these challenges by (a) expanding the available dataset through the integration of NO2 data from Sentinel-5P, generating continuous XCO2 maps, and incorporating real satellite observations from OCO-2/3 for over 71 power plants in data-scarce regions; and (b) employing a customized U-Net model capable of handling diverse spatio-temporal resolutions for emission rate estimation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods. By leveraging this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of major CO2 emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and informing regulatory frameworks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksii Molodchyk, Philipp Schmitz, Alexander Engelmann, Karl Worthmann, Timm Faulwasser</p>
            <p>The operation of large-scale power systems is usually scheduled ahead via numerical optimization. However, this requires models of grid topology, line parameters, and bus specifications. Classic approaches first identify the network topology, i.e., the graph of interconnections and the associated impedances. The power generation schedules are then computed by solving a multi-stage optimal power flow (OPF) problem built around the model. In this paper, we explore the prospect of data-driven approaches to multi-stage optimal power flow. Specifically, we leverage recent findings from systems and control to bypass the identification step and to construct the optimization problem directly from data. We illustrate the performance of our method on a 118-bus system and compare it with the classical identification-based approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yassine El Manyari, Anton R. Fuxjager, Stefan Zahlner, Joost Van Dijk, Alberto Castagna, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Marcel Wasserer</p>
            <p>Power grid operators face increasing difficulties in the control room as the increase in energy demand and the shift to renewable energy introduce new complexities in managing congestion and maintaining a stable supply. Effective grid topology control requires advanced tools capable of handling multi-objective trade-offs. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for tackling such challenges, existing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) approaches fail to scale to the large state and action spaces inherent in real-world grid operations. Here we present a two-phase, efficient and scalable Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) method designed for grid topology control, combining an efficient RL learning phase with a rapid planning phase to generate day-ahead plans for unseen scenarios. We validate our approach using historical data from TenneT, a European Transmission System Operator (TSO), demonstrating minimal deployment time, generating day-ahead plans within 4-7 minutes with strong performance. These results underline the potential of our scalable method to support real-world power grid management, offering a practical, computationally efficient, and time-effective tool for operational planning. Based on current congestion costs and inefficiencies in grid operations, adopting our approach by TSOs could potentially save millions of euros annually, providing a compelling economic incentive for its integration in the control room.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Lautenbacher, Ali Rajaei, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Jochen L. Cremer</p>
            <p>Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</p>

            <p>Joint phase-time arrays (JPTA) is a new mmWave radio frequency front-end architecture constructed with appending time-delay elements to phase shifters for analog beamforming. JPTA allows the mmWave base station (BS) to form multiple frequency-dependent beams with a single RF chain, exploiting the extra degrees of freedom the time-delay elements offer. Without requiring extra power-hungry RF chains, a BS with JPTA can schedule multiple users in different directions in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) manner. A BS with JPTA achieves various advantages over the traditional analog beamforming system. Simulation results show that JPTA can bring significant system-level benefits, e.g., extending uplink throughput coverage by 100%. To realize these system benefits of JPTA, high-resolution delay elements with a wide delay dynamic range are essential. With newly developed delay elements, we demonstrate that a single TRX RF chain can serve four users in four different directions in the mmWave band.</p>

            <p>P300 is an Event-Related Potential widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces, but its detection is challenging due to inter-subject and temporal variability. This work introduces a clustering methodology based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to extract the P300 structure, ensuring robustness against variability. We propose a novel signal-to-ASCII transformation to generate compression-friendly objects, which are then clustered using a hierarchical tree-based method and a multidimensional projection approach. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the method's ability to reveal relevant P300 structures, showing clustering performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, analysis at the electrode level suggests that the method could assist in electrode selection for P300 detection. This compression-driven clustering methodology offers a complementary tool for EEG analysis and P300 identification.</p>

            <h2>Provably-Stable Neural Network-Based Control of Nonlinear Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anran Li, John P. Swensen, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh</p>
            <p>In recent years, Neural Networks (NNs) have been employed to control nonlinear systems due to their potential capability in dealing with situations that might be difficult for conventional nonlinear control schemes. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature on NN-based control lacks theoretical guarantees for stability and tracking performance. This precludes the application of NN-based control schemes to systems where stringent stability and performance guarantees are required. To address this gap, this paper proposes a systematic and comprehensive methodology to design provably-stable NN-based control schemes for affine nonlinear systems. Rigorous analysis is provided to show that the proposed approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop system with the NN in the loop. Also, it is shown that the resulting NN-based control scheme ensures that system states asymptotically converge to a neighborhood around the desired equilibrium point, with a tunable proximity threshold. The proposed methodology is validated and evaluated via simulation studies on an inverted pendulum and experimental studies on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.</p>

            <h2>SigWavNet: Learning Multiresolution Signal Wavelet Network for Speech Emotion Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alaa Nfissi, Wassim Bouachir, Nizar Bouguila, Brian Mishara</p>
            <p>In the field of human-computer interaction and psychological assessment, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in deciphering emotional states from speech signals. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to system complexity, feature distinctiveness issues, and noise interference. This paper introduces a new end-to-end (E2E) deep learning multi-resolution framework for SER, addressing these limitations by extracting meaningful representations directly from raw waveform speech signals. By leveraging the properties of the fast discrete wavelet transform (FDWT), including the cascade algorithm, conjugate quadrature filter, and coefficient denoising, our approach introduces a learnable model for both wavelet bases and denoising through deep learning techniques. The framework incorporates an activation function for learnable asymmetric hard thresholding of wavelet coefficients. Our approach exploits the capabilities of wavelets for effective localization in both time and frequency domains. We then combine one-dimensional dilated convolutional neural networks (1D dilated CNN) with a spatial attention layer and bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) with a temporal attention layer to efficiently capture the nuanced spatial and temporal characteristics of emotional features. By handling variable-length speech without segmentation and eliminating the need for pre or post-processing, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and EMO-DB datasets.

            <h2>Do Audio-Visual Segmentation Models Truly Segment Sounding Objects?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Li, Wenjie Zhao, Ziru Huang, Yunhui Guo, Yapeng Tian</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) requires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to determine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging transformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have achieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important question remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to segment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this issue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in current methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly on visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in unreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this challenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark incorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient noise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach combining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided similarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS methods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the prevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable improvements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining near-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdul Rehman, Ilona Heldal, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin</p>
            <p>Self Supervised Representation Learning (SSRepL) can capture meaningful and robust representations of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) data and have the potential to improve the model's performance on also downstream different types of Neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) detection. In this paper, a novel SSRepL and Transfer Learning (TL)-based framework that incorporates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) model is proposed to detect children with potential symptoms of ADHD. This model uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals extracted during visual attention tasks to accurately detect ADHD by preprocessing EEG signal quality through normalization, filtering, and data balancing. For the experimental analysis, we use three different models: 1) SSRepL and TL-based LSTM-GRU model named as SSRepL-ADHD, which integrates LSTM and GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data, 2) lightweight SSRepL-based DNN model (LSSRepL-DNN), and 3) Random Forest (RF). In the study, these models are thoroughly evaluated using well-known performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). The results show that the proposed SSRepL-ADHD model achieves the maximum accuracy of 81.11% while admitting the difficulties associated with dataset imbalance and feature selection.</p>

            <p>Though end-to-end speech-to-text translation has been a great success, we argue that the cascaded speech-to-text translation model still has its place, which is usually criticized for the error propagation between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) models. In this paper, we explore the benefits of incorporating multiple candidates from ASR and self-supervised speech features into MT. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause of cascading errors stems from the increased divergence between similar samples in the speech domain when mapped to the text domain. By including multiple candidates and self-supervised speech features, our approach allows the machine translation model to choose the right words and ensure precise translation using various speech samples. This strategy minimizes error spread and takes advantage of large ASR and MT datasets, along with pre-trained ASR/MT models, while addressing associated issues.</p>

To address this issue, a lightweight 1,400 parameters TinyFC was devised to enhance the FOC performance while fitting into the computational and memory constraints of a micro-controller. Advanced optimization techniques, including pruning, hyperparameter tuning, and quantization to 8-bit integers, were applied to reduce the model's footprint while preserving the network effectiveness. Simulation results show the proposed approach significantly reduced overshoot by up to 87.5%, with the pruned model achieving complete overshoot elimination, highlighting the potential of tiny neural networks in real-time motor control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renhao Lu</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the performance of semantic segmentation. However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited for capturing high-dimensional directional features and exhibits greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the orientation, position, and velocity of a vehicle operating in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN.

            <h2>The Query/Hit Model for Sequential Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahshad Shariatnasab, Stefano Rini, Farhad Shirani, S. Sitharama Iyengar</p>
            <p>This work introduces the Query/Hit (Q/H) learning model. The setup consists of two agents. One agent, Alice, has access to a streaming source, while the other, Bob, does not have direct access to the source. Communication occurs through sequential Q/H pairs: Bob sends a sequence of source symbols (queries), and Alice responds with the waiting time until each query appears in the source stream (hits). This model is motivated by scenarios with communication, computation, and privacy constraints that limit real-time access to the source. The error exponent for sequential hypothesis testing under the Q/H model is characterized, and a querying strategy, the Dynamic Scout-Sentinel Algorithm (DSSA), is proposed. The strategy employs a mutual information neural estimator to compute the error exponent associated with each query and to select the query with the highest efficiency. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets -- including mouse movement trajectories, typesetting patterns, and touch-based user interactions -- are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy in comparison with baselines, in terms of probability of error, query choice, and time-to-detection.</p>

            <h2>A Flexible Precision Scaling Deep Neural Network Accelerator with Efficient Weight Combination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Zhao, Kunming Shao, Fengshi Tian, Tim Kwang-Ting Cheng, Chi-Ying Tsui, Yi Zou</p>
            <p>Deploying mixed-precision neural networks on edge devices is friendly to hardware resources and power consumption. To support fully mixed-precision neural network inference, it is necessary to design flexible hardware accelerators for continuous varying precision operations. However, the previous works have issues on hardware utilization and overhead of reconfigurable logic. In this paper, we propose an efficient accelerator for 2~8-bit precision scaling with serial activation input and parallel weight preloaded. First, we set two loading modes for the weight operands and decompose the weight into the corresponding bitwidths, which extends the weight precision support efficiently. Then, to improve hardware utilization of low-precision operations, we design the architecture that performs bit-serial MAC operation with systolic dataflow, and the partial sums are combined spatially. Furthermore, we designed an efficient carry save adder tree supporting both signed and unsigned number summation across rows. The experiment result shows that the proposed accelerator, synthesized with TSMC 28nm CMOS technology, achieves peak throughput of 4.09TOPS and peak energy efficiency of 68.94TOPS/W at 2/2-bit operations.</p>

            <h2>S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunuo Chen, Qian Li, Bing He, Donghui Feng, Ronghua Wu, Qi Wang, Li Song, Guo Lu, Wenjun Zhang</p>
            <p>Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</p>

            <p>Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isha Gupta, David Khachaturov, Robert Mullins</p>
            <p>The rise of multimodal large language models has introduced innovative human-machine interaction paradigms but also significant challenges in machine learning safety. Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are especially relevant due to the intuitive nature of spoken communication, yet little is known about their failure modes. This paper explores audio jailbreaks targeting ALMs, focusing on their ability to bypass alignment mechanisms. We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal. These results have important implications for understanding the interactions between different modalities in multimodal models, and offer actionable insights for enhancing defenses against adversarial audio attacks.</p>

            <p>Auscultation plays a pivotal role in early respiratory and pulmonary disease diagnosis. Despite the emergence of deep learning-based methods for automatic respiratory sound classification post-Covid-19, limited datasets impede performance enhancement. Distinguishing between normal and abnormal respiratory sounds poses challenges due to the coexistence of normal respiratory components and noise components in both types. Moreover, different abnormal respiratory sounds exhibit similar anomalous features, hindering their differentiation. Besides, existing state-of-the-art models suffer from excessive parameter size, impeding deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. To address these issues, we design a lightweight network CycleGuardian and propose a framework based on an improved deep clustering and contrastive learning. We first generate a hybrid spectrogram for feature diversity and grouping spectrograms to facilitating intermittent abnormal sound this http URL, CycleGuardian integrates a deep clustering module with a similarity-constrained clustering component to improve the ability to capture abnormal features and a contrastive learning module with group mixing for enhanced abnormal feature discernment. Multi-objective optimization enhances overall performance during training. In experiments we use the ICBHI2017 dataset, following the official split method and without any pre-trained weights, our method achieves Sp: 82.06 $\%$, Se: 44.47$\%$, and Score: 63.26$\%$ with a network model size of 38M, comparing to the current model, our method leads by nearly 7$\%$, achieving the current best performances. Additionally, we deploy the network on Android devices, showcasing a comprehensive intelligent respiratory sound auscultation system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eun Som Jeon, Hongjun Choi, Matthew P. Buman, Pavan Turaga</p>
            <p>The analysis of wearable sensor data has enabled many successes in several applications. To represent the high-sampling rate time-series with sufficient detail, the use of topological data analysis (TDA) has been considered, and it is found that TDA can complement other time-series features. Nonetheless, due to the large time consumption and high computational resource requirements of extracting topological features through TDA, it is difficult to deploy topological knowledge in various applications. To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) can be adopted, which is a technique facilitating model compression and transfer learning to generate a smaller model by transferring knowledge from a larger network. By leveraging multiple teachers in KD, both time-series and topological features can be transferred, and finally, a superior student using only time-series data is distilled. On the other hand, mixup has been popularly used as a robust data augmentation technique to enhance model performance during training. Mixup and KD employ similar learning strategies. In KD, the student model learns from the smoothed distribution generated by the teacher model, while mixup creates smoothed labels by blending two labels. Hence, this common smoothness serves as the connecting link that establishes a connection between these two methods. In this paper, we analyze the role of mixup in KD with time-series as well as topological persistence, employing multiple teachers. We present a comprehensive analysis of various methods in KD and mixup on wearable sensor data.</p>

            <h2>A method for estimating forest carbon storage distribution density via artificial intelligence generated content model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Yu, Jinnian Wang</p>
            <p>Forest is the most significant land-based carbon storage mechanism. The forest carbon sink can effectively decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration and mitigate climate change. Remote sensing estimation not only ensures high accuracy of data, but also enables large-scale area observation. Optical images provide the possibility for long-term monitoring, which is a potential issue in the future carbon storage estimation research. We chose Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China as the study area, took GF-1 WFV satellite image as the data, introduced the KD-VGG module to extract the initial features, and proposed the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM). The results showed that: (1) The VGG-19 module after knowledge distillation can realize the initial feature extraction, reduce the inference time and improve the accuracy in the case of reducing the number of model parameters. (2) The Attention + MLP module was added for feature fusion to obtain the relationship between global and local features and realized the restoration of high-fidelity images in the continuous scale range. (3) The IIDM model proposed in this paper had the highest estimation accuracy, with RMSE of 28.68, which was 13.16 higher than that of the regression model, about 31.45%. In the estimation of carbon storage, the generative model can extract deeper features, and its performance was significantly better than other models. It demonstrated the feasibility of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in the field of quantitative remote sensing and provided valuable insights for the study of carbon neutralization effect. By combining the actual characteristics of the forest, the regional carbon storage estimation with a resolution of 16-meter was utilized to provide a significant theoretical basis for the formulation of forest carbon sink regulation.</p>

            <h2>Adversarial Semantic Augmentation for Training Generative Adversarial Networks under Limited Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengping Yang, Zhe Wang, Ziqiu Chi, Dongdong Li, Wenli Du</p>
            <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made remarkable achievements in synthesizing images in recent years. Typically, training GANs requires massive data, and the performance of GANs deteriorates significantly when training data is limited. To improve the synthesis performance of GANs in low-data regimes, existing approaches use various data augmentation techniques to enlarge the training sets. However, it is identified that these augmentation techniques may leak or even alter the data distribution. To remedy this, we propose an adversarial semantic augmentation (ASA) technique to enlarge the training data at the semantic level instead of the image level. Concretely, considering semantic features usually encode informative information of images, we estimate the covariance matrices of semantic features for both real and generated images to find meaningful transformation directions. Such directions translate original features to another semantic representation, e.g., changing the backgrounds or expressions of the human face dataset. Moreover, we derive an upper bound of the expected adversarial loss. By optimizing the upper bound, our semantic augmentation is implicitly achieved. Such design avoids redundant sampling of the augmented features and introduces negligible computation overhead, making our approach computation efficient. Extensive experiments on both few-shot and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improve the synthesis quality under various data regimes, and further visualized and analytic results suggesting satisfactory versatility of our proposed method.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a Newton-based stochastic extremum-seeking control method for real-time optimization in multi-input systems with distinct input delays. It combines predictor-based feedback and Hessian inverse estimation via stochastic perturbations to enable delay compensation with user-defined convergence rates. The method ensures exponential stability and convergence near the unknown extremum, even under long delays. It extends to multi-input, single-output systems with cross-coupled channels. Stability is analyzed using backstepping and infinite-dimensional averaging. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in handling time-delayed channels, showcasing both the challenges and benefits of real-time optimization in distributed parameter settings.</p>

            <p>We present a general mathematical framework for optimizing cell deployment and antenna configuration in wireless networks, inspired by quantization theory. Unlike traditional methods, our framework supports networks with deterministically located nodes, enabling modeling and optimization under controlled deployment scenarios. We demonstrate our framework through two applications: joint fine-tuning of antenna parameters across base stations (BSs) to optimize network coverage, capacity, and load balancing, and the strategic deployment of new BSs, including the optimization of their locations and antenna settings. These optimizations are conducted for a heterogeneous 3D user population, comprising ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) along aerial corridors. Our case studies highlight the framework's versatility in optimizing performance metrics such as the coverage-capacity trade-off and capacity per region. Our results confirm that optimizing the placement and orientation of additional BSs consistently outperforms approaches focused solely on antenna adjustments, regardless of GUE distribution. Furthermore, joint optimization for both GUEs and UAVs significantly enhances UAV service without severely affecting GUE performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Hugo Pereira Rodrigues, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Miroslav Krstic, Paulo Tabuada</p>
            <p>This paper proposes the incorporation of static event-triggered control in the actuation path of Newton-based extremum seeking and its comparison with the earlier gradient version. As in the continuous methods, the convergence rate of the gradient approach depends on the unknown Hessian of the nonlinear map to be optimized, whereas the proposed event-triggered Newton-based extremum seeking eliminates this dependence, becoming user-assignable. This is achieved by means of a dynamic estimator for the Hessian's inverse, implemented as a Riccati equation filter. Lyapunov stability and averaging theory for discontinuous systems are applied to analyze the closed-loop system. Local exponential practical stability is guaranteed to a small neighborhood of the extremum point of scalar and static maps. Numerical simulations illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach over the previous gradient method, including improved convergence speed, followed by a reduction in the amplitude and updating frequency of the control signals.</p>

            <p>In this study, we introduce a novel method to predict mental health by building machine learning models for a non-invasive wearable device equipped with Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) and Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FS) sensors. Besides, we present the corresponding dataset to predict mental health, e.g. depression, anxiety, and stress levels via the DAS-21 questionnaire. To our best knowledge, this is the world's largest and the most generalized dataset ever collected for both LDF and FS studies. The device captures cutaneous blood microcirculation parameters, and wavelet analysis of the LDF signal extracts key rhythmic oscillations. The dataset, collected from 132 volunteers aged 18-94 from 19 countries, explores relationships between physiological features, demographics, lifestyle habits, and health conditions. We employed a variety of machine learning methods to classify stress detection, in which LightGBM is identified as the most effective model for stress detection, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.7168 and a PR AUC of 0.8852. In addition, we also incorporated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques into our analysis to investigate deeper insights into the model's predictions. Our results suggest that females, younger individuals and those with a higher Body Mass Index (BMI) or heart rate have a greater likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions like stress and anxiety.

            <p>How much can we infer about an emotional voice solely from an expressive face? This intriguing question holds great potential for applications such as virtual character dubbing and aiding individuals with expressive language disorders. Existing face-to-speech methods offer great promise in capturing identity characteristics but struggle to generate diverse vocal styles with emotional expression. In this paper, we explore a new task, termed emotional face-to-speech, aiming to synthesize emotional speech directly from expressive facial cues. To that end, we introduce DEmoFace, a novel generative framework that leverages a discrete diffusion transformer (DiT) with curriculum learning, built upon a multi-level neural audio codec. Specifically, we propose multimodal DiT blocks to dynamically align text and speech while tailoring vocal styles based on facial emotion and identity. To enhance training efficiency and generation quality, we further introduce a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning algorithm for multi-level token processing. In addition, we develop an enhanced predictor-free guidance to handle diverse conditioning scenarios, enabling multi-conditional generation and disentangling complex attributes effectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEmoFace generates more natural and consistent speech compared to baselines, even surpassing speech-driven methods.

            <p>This paper proposes a novel parallel coding transmission strategy and an iterative detection and decoding receiver signal processing technique for orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a parallel channel encoding (PCE) scheme that consists of multiple short-length codewords for each delay-Doppler multicarrier (DDMC) symbol. Building upon such a PCE transmission framework, we then introduce an iterative detection and decoding algorithm incorporating a successive decoding feedback (SDF) technique, which enables instant information exchange between the detector and decoder for each DDMC symbol. To characterize the error performance of the proposed scheme, we perform density evolution analysis considering the finite blocklength effects. Our analysis results, coupled with extensive simulations, demonstrate that the proposed PCE scheme with the SDF algorithm not only showcases a better overall performance but also requires much less decoding complexity to implement, compared to the conventional benchmark scheme that relies on a single long channel code for coding the entire ODDM frame.</p>

Unlike previous methods that rely on residual vector quantization, our model leverages continuous speech representations from the VAE's latent space, greatly simplifying the training and inference pipelines. We also introduce a stochastic monotonic alignment mechanism to enforce strict monotonic alignments. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive model VALL-E in both subjective and objective evaluations, achieving these results with only 10.3\% of VALL-E's parameters. This demonstrates the potential of continuous speech language models as a more efficient alternative to existing quantization-based speech language models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dabin Kim, Inkyu Jang, Youngsoo Han, Sunwoo Hwang, H. Jin Kim</p>
            <p>Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</p>

            <p>Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based foundation models are gaining traction due to the widespread use of PPG in biosignal monitoring and their potential to generalize across diverse health applications. In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p>

            <p>Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</p>

            <p>Backdoor attacks have posed a significant threat to the security of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite considerable strides in developing defenses against backdoor attacks in the visual domain, the specialized defenses for the audio domain remain empty. Furthermore, the defenses adapted from the visual to audio domain demonstrate limited effectiveness. To fill this gap, we propose Gradient Norm-based FineTuning (GN-FT), a novel defense strategy against the attacks in the audio domain, based on the observation from the corresponding backdoored models. Specifically, we first empirically find that the backdoored neurons exhibit greater gradient values compared to other neurons, while clean neurons stay the lowest. On this basis, we fine-tune the backdoored model by incorporating the gradient norm regularization, aiming to weaken and reduce the backdoored neurons. We further approximate the loss computation for lower implementation costs. Extensive experiments on two speech recognition datasets across five models demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first specialized and effective defense against backdoor attacks in the audio domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehuda Mishaly, Lior Wolf, Eliya Nachmani</p>
            <p>We present a novel deep learning network for Active Speech Cancellation (ASC), advancing beyond Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) methods by effectively canceling both noise and speech signals. The proposed Multi-Band Mamba architecture segments input audio into distinct frequency bands, enabling precise anti-signal generation and improved phase alignment across frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven loss function that provides near-optimal supervisory signals for anti-signal generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, achieving up to 7.2dB improvement in ANC scenarios and 6.2dB in ASC, significantly outperforming existing methods.

            <h2>Optimization-based Coordination of Traffic Lights and Automated Vehicles at Intersections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Azita Dabiri, Giray Önür, Sebastien Gros, Bart De Schutter</p>
            <p>This paper tackles the challenge of coordinating traffic lights and automated vehicles at signalized intersections, formulated as a constrained finite-horizon optimal control problem. The problem falls into the category of mixed-integer nonlinear programming, posing challenges for solving large instances. To address this, we introduce a decomposition approach consisting of an upper-level problem for traffic light timing allocation and a set of lower-level problems that generate appropriate commands for automated vehicles in each intersection movement. By leveraging solutions from the lower-level problems and employing parametric optimization techniques, we solve the upper-level problem using a standard sequential quadratic programming approach. The paper concludes by presenting an illustrative numerical example that highlights the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to scenarios where no coordination between traffic lights and vehicles exists.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Cerone, S. M. Fosson, S. Pirrera, D. Regruto</p>
            <p>Multivariate polynomial optimization is a prevalent model for a number of engineering problems. From a mathematical viewpoint, polynomial optimization is challenging because it is non-convex. The Lasserre's theory, based on semidefinite relaxations, provides an effective tool to overcome this issue and to achieve the global optimum. However, this approach can be computationally complex for medium and large scale problems. For this motivation, in this work, we investigate a local minimization approach, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which is low-complex, straightforward to implement, and prone to decentralization. The core of the work is the development of the algorithm tailored to polynomial optimization, along with the proof of its convergence. Through a numerical example we show a practical implementation and test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with respect to state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>

            <h2>Embrace Collisions: Humanoid Shadowing for Deployable Contact-Agnostics Motions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziwen Zhuang, Hang Zhao</p>
            <p>Previous humanoid robot research works treat the robot as a bipedal mobile manipulation platform, where only the feet and hands contact the environment. However, we humans use all body parts to interact with the world, e.g., we sit in chairs, get up from the ground, or roll on the floor. Contacting the environment using body parts other than feet and hands brings significant challenges in both model-predictive control and reinforcement learning-based methods. An unpredictable contact sequence makes it almost impossible for model-predictive control to plan ahead in real time. The success of the zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning method for humanoids heavily depends on the acceleration of GPU-based rigid-body physical simulator and simplification of the collision detection. Lacking extreme torso movement of the humanoid research makes all other components non-trivial to design, such as termination conditions, motion commands and reward designs. To address these potential challenges, we propose a general humanoid motion framework that takes discrete motion commands and controls the robot's motor action in real time. Using a GPU-accelerated rigid-body simulator, we train a humanoid whole-body control policy that follows the high-level motion command in the real world in real time, even with stochastic contacts and extremely large robot base rotation and not-so-feasible motion command.

            <h2>Simultaneous Automatic Picking and Manual Picking Refinement for First-Break</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowen Bai, Zixiang Zhao, Jiangshe Zhang, Yukun Cui, Chunxia Zhang, Zhenbo Guo, Yongjun Wang</p>
            <p>First-break picking is a pivotal procedure in processing microseismic data for geophysics and resource exploration. Recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break. Nevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement for detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential mislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively affect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle outliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking and Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier samples or even noisy labels. Unlike conventional approaches that regard manual picks as ground truth, our method treats the true first-break as a latent variable within a probabilistic model that includes a first-break labeling prior. SPR aims to uncover this variable, enabling dynamic adjustments and improved accuracy across the dataset. This strategy mitigates the impact of outliers or inaccuracies in manual labels. Intra-site picking experiments and cross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our method's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across different sites. Additionally, our investigations into noisy signals and labels underscore SPR's resilience to both types of noise and its capability to refine misaligned manual annotations. Moreover, the flexibility of SPR, not being limited to any single network architecture, enhances its adaptability across various deep learning-based picking methods. Focusing on learning from data that may contain outliers or partial inaccuracies, SPR provides a robust solution to some of the principal obstacles in automatic first-break picking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Dadiotis, Mayank Mittal, Nikos Tsagarakis, Marco Hutter</p>
            <p>Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yacouba Kaloga, Shashi Kumar, Petr Motlicek, Ina Kodrasi</p>
            <p>Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric, called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method considerably improves alignment performance, though with a trade-off in ASR performance when compared to CTC. We believe this work opens new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development within the community.</p>

            <p>Pinching antennas have been recently proposed as a promising flexible-antenna technology, which can be implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. This work explores the potential of employing pinching antenna systems (PASs) for downlink transmission in a multiuser MIMO setting. We consider the problem of hybrid beamforming, where the digital precoder at the access point and the activated locations of the pinching elements are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable weighted sum-rate. Invoking fractional programming, a novel low-complexity algorithm is developed to iteratively update the precoding matrix and the locations of the pinching antennas. We validate the proposed scheme through extensive numerical experiments. Our investigations demonstrate that using PAS the system throughput can be significantly boosted as compared with the conventional fixed-location antenna systems, enlightening the potential of PAS as an enabling candidate for next-generation wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Tian, Chau-Wai Wong, Sushant M. Ranadive, Min Wu</p>
            <p>Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an important indicator for pulmonary and respiratory functionalities. Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO$_2$. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone's camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO$_2$ monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO$_2$ information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO$_2$ prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.</p>

            <h2>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Airaldi, Bart De Schutter, Azita Dabiri</p>
            <p>In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</p>

            <p>Major cities worldwide experience problems with the performance of their road transportation systems, and the continuous increase in traffic demand presents a substantial challenge to the optimal operation of urban road networks and the efficiency of traffic control strategies. The operation of transportation systems is widely considered to display fragile property, i.e., the loss in performance increases exponentially with the linearly increasing magnitude of disruptions. Meanwhile, the risk engineering community is embracing the novel concept of antifragility, enabling systems to learn from historical disruptions and exhibit improved performance under black swan events. In this study, based on established traffic models, namely fundamental diagrams and macroscopic fundamental diagrams, we first conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis to prove the fragile nature of the systems theoretically. Subsequently, we propose a skewness-based indicator that can be readily applied to cross-compare the degree of fragility for different networks solely dependent on the MFD-related parameters. At last, by taking real-world stochasticity into account, we implemented a numerical simulation with realistic network data to bridge the gap between the theoretical proof and the real-world operations, to reflect the potential impact of uncertainty on the fragility of the systems. This work aims to demonstrate the fragile nature of road transportation systems and help researchers better comprehend the necessity to consider explicitly antifragile design for future traffic control strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hexin Liu, Xiangyu Zhang, Haoyang Zhang, Leibny Paola Garcia, Andy W. H. Khong, Eng Siong Chng, Shinji Watanabe</p>
            <p>Code-switching (CS) refers to the switching of languages within a speech signal and results in language confusion for automatic speech recognition (ASR). To address language confusion, we introduce a novel language alignment loss into ASR training to align acoustic features to pseudo-language labels learned from the ASR decoder. This approach enables frame-level language identification without the need for frame-level language annotations. To further tackle the complex token alternatives for language modeling in bilingual scenarios, we propose to employ large language models via a generative error correction method. A linguistic hint, which is derived from LAL outputs and decoded hypotheses, is introduced to guide the prompting and enhance the LLM-based generative error correction for CS-ASR. The proposed methods are evaluated on the SEAME dataset and data from the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition challenge. The incorporation of the proposed language alignment loss improves the CS-ASR performance for both hybrid CTC/attention and Whisper models on both datasets, with only a negligible increase in the number of parameters. This work also highlights the efficacy of language alignment loss in balancing primary-language-dominant bilingual data during training, with an 8.6% relative improvement on the ASRU dataset compared to the baseline model. Performance evaluation using large language models reveals the advantage of the linguistic hint by achieving 14.1% and 5.5% relative improvement on test sets of the ASRU and SEAME datasets, respectively.</p>

            <p>This paper develops an adaptive state tracking control scheme for discrete-time systems, using the least-squares algorithm, as the new solution to the long-standing discrete-time adaptive state tracking control problem to which the Lyapunov method (well-developed for the continuous-time adaptive state tracking problem) is not applicable. The new adaptive state tracking scheme is based on a recently-developed new discrete-time error model which has been used for gradient algorithm based state tracking control schemes, and uses the least-squares algorithm for parameter adaptation. The new least-squares algorithm is derived to minimize an accumulative estimation error, to ensure certain optimality for parameter estimation. The system stability and output tracking properties are studied. Technical results are presented in terms of plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, optimality formulation, and stability and tracking analysis. The developed adaptive control scheme is applied to a discrete-time multiple mobile robot system to meet an adaptive state tracking objective. In addition, a collision avoidance mechanism is proposed to prevent collisions in the whole tracking process. Simulation results are presented, which verify the desired system state tracking properties under the developed least-squares algorithm based adaptive control scheme.</p>

            <p>Weakly supervised segmentation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations during model training. However, the current weakly supervised nuclei segmentation approaches typically follow a two-stage pseudo-label generation and network training process. The performance of the nuclei segmentation heavily relies on the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, thereby limiting its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel domain-adaptive weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework using cross-task interaction strategies to overcome the challenge of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, we utilize weakly annotated data to train an auxiliary detection task, which assists the domain adaptation of the segmentation network. To enhance the efficiency of domain adaptation, we design a consistent feature constraint module integrating prior knowledge from the source domain. Furthermore, we develop pseudo-label optimization and interactive training methods to improve the domain transfer capability. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive comparative and ablation experiments on six datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing weakly supervised approaches. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable or even better performance than fully supervised methods. Our code will be released in this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Kazma, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>The rapid increase in the integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources (RER) introduces challenging issues related to power system stability. Interestingly, identifying grid nodes that can best support stochastic loads from RER, has gained recent interest. Methods based on Lyapunov stability are commonly exploited to assess the stability of power networks. These strategies approach quantifying system stability while considering: (i) simplified reduced order power system models that do not model power flow constraints, or (ii) data-driven methods that are prone to measurement noise and hence can inaccurately depict stochastic loads as system instability. In this paper, while considering a nonlinear differential algebraic equation (NL-DAE) model, we introduce a new method for assessing the impact of uncertain renewable power injections on the stability of power system nodes/buses. The identification of stable nodes informs the operator/utility on how renewables injections affect the stability of the grid. The proposed method is based on optimizing metrics equivalent to the Lyapunov spectrum of exponents; its underlying properties result in a computationally efficient and scalable stable node identification algorithm for renewable energy resources allocation. The developed framework is studied on various standard power networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoon Huh, Hyowoon Seo, Wan Choi</p>
            <p>From the perspective of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), there has been significant research on utilizing semantic communication, which inherently possesses analog characteristics, within digital device environments. However, a single-model approach that operates modulation-agnostically across various digital modulation orders has not yet been established. This article presents the first attempt at such an approach by proposing a universal joint source-channel coding (uJSCC) system that utilizes a single-model encoder-decoder pair and trained vector quantization (VQ) codebooks. To support various modulation orders within a single model, the operation of every neural network (NN)-based module in the uJSCC system requires the selection of modulation orders according to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boundaries. To address the challenge of unequal output statistics from shared parameters across NN layers, we integrate multiple batch normalization (BN) layers, selected based on modulation order, after each NN layer. This integration occurs with minimal impact on the overall model size. Through a comprehensive series of experiments, we validate that the modulation-agnostic semantic communication framework demonstrates superiority over existing digital semantic communication approaches in terms of model complexity, communication efficiency, and task effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Can Yavuz, Yang Yang</p>
            <p>Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance. In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models. We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks. this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgenii Genov, Julian Ruddick, Christoph Bergmeir, Majid Vafaeipour, Thierry Coosemans, Salvador Garcia, Maarten Messagie</p>
            <p>This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Over-the-Air Federated Learning Using AI-based Fluid Antenna System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Ahmadzadeh, Saeid Pakravan, Ghosheh Abed Hodtani, Ming Zeng, Jean-Yves Chouinard, Leslie A. Rusch</p>
            <p>This paper investigates an over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) system that employs fluid antennas (FAs) at an access point. The system enhances learning performance by leveraging the additional degrees of freedom provided by antenna mobility. We analyze the convergence of the OTA-FL system and derive the optimality gap to illustrate the influence of FAs on learning performance. With these results, we formulate a nonconvex optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the positions of the FAs, the beamforming vector, and the transmit power allocation at each user. To address the dynamic environment, we cast this optimization problem as a Markov decision process and propose the recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations show that the FA-assisted OTA-FL system outperforms systems with fixed-position antennas and that the RDPG algorithm surpasses the existing methods.</p>

            <h2>Computational Complexity-Constrained Spectral Efficiency Analysis for 6G Waveforms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saulo Queiroz, João P. Vilela, Benjamin Koon Kei Ng, Chan-Tong Lam, Edmundo Monteiro</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a tutorial on how to account for the computational time complexity overhead of signal processing in the spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of wireless waveforms. Our methodology is particularly relevant in scenarios where achieving higher SE entails a penalty in complexity, a common trade-off present in 6G candidate waveforms. We consider that SE derives from the data rate, which is impacted by time-dependent overheads. Thus, neglecting the computational complexity overhead in the SE analysis grants an unfair advantage to more computationally complex waveforms, as they require larger computational resources to meet a signal processing runtime below the symbol period. We demonstrate our points with two case studies. In the first, we refer to IEEE 802.11a-compliant baseband processors from the literature to show that their runtime significantly impacts the SE perceived by upper layers. In the second case study, we show that waveforms considered less efficient in terms of SE can outperform their more computationally expensive counterparts if provided with equivalent high-performance computational resources. Based on these cases, we believe our tutorial can address the comparative SE analysis of waveforms that operate under different computational resource constraints.</p>

            <h2>PRIME: Blind Multispectral Unmixing Using Virtual Quantum Prism and Convex Geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Hsiang Lin, Jhao-Ting Lin</p>
            <p>Multispectral unmixing (MU) is critical due to the inevitable mixed pixel phenomenon caused by the limited spatial resolution of typical multispectral images in remote sensing. However, MU mathematically corresponds to the underdetermined blind source separation problem, thus highly challenging, preventing researchers from tackling it. Previous MU works all ignore the underdetermined issue, and merely consider scenarios with more bands than sources. This work attempts to resolve the underdetermined issue by further conducting the light-splitting task using a network-inspired virtual prism, and as this task is challenging, we achieve so by incorporating the very advanced quantum feature extraction techniques. We emphasize that the prism is virtual (allowing us to fix the spectral response as a simple deterministic matrix), so the virtual hyperspectral image (HSI) it generates has no need to correspond to some real hyperspectral sensor; in other words, it is good enough as long as the virtual HSI satisfies some fundamental properties of light splitting (e.g., non-negativity and continuity). With the above virtual quantum prism, we know that the virtual HSI is expected to possess some desired simplex structure. This allows us to adopt the convex geometry to unmix the spectra, followed by downsampling the pure spectra back to the multispectral domain, thereby achieving MU. Experimental evidence shows great potential of our MU algorithm, termed as prism-inspired multispectral endmember extraction (PRIME).</p>

            <h2>Certifiable Reachability Learning Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingqi Li, Donggun Lee, Jaewon Lee, Kris Shengjun Dong, Somayeh Sojoudi, Claire Tomlin</p>
            <p>We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite disturbances within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reachavoid value function, and post-learning certification. Compared to prior work, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway take-over example.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl El Hajal, Ajinkya Kulkarni, Enno Hermann, Mathew Magimai.-Doss</p>
            <p>While recent zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. Further, SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity. In this study, we introduce kNN-TTS, a simple and effective framework for zero-shot multi-speaker TTS using retrieval methods which leverage the linear relationships between SSL features. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our models, trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker only, achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that are trained on significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that kNN-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine-grained voice morphing. Demo samples are available at this https URL</p>

            <h2>NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Bang Jiang, Yansen Wang, Bao-Liang Lu, Dongsheng Li</p>
            <p>Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p>

            <h2>Wave-U-Mamba: An End-To-End Framework For High-Quality And Efficient Speech Super Resolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongjoon Lee, Chanwoo Kim</p>
            <p>Speech Super-Resolution (SSR) is a task of enhancing low-resolution speech signals by restoring missing high-frequency components. Conventional approaches typically reconstruct log-mel features, followed by a vocoder that generates high-resolution speech in the waveform domain. However, as mel features lack phase information, this can result in performance degradation during the reconstruction phase. Motivated by recent advances with Selective State Spaces Models (SSMs), we propose a method, referred to as Wave-U-Mamba that directly performs SSR in time domain. In our comparative study, including models such as WSRGlow, NU-Wave 2, and AudioSR, Wave-U-Mamba demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) across various low-resolution sampling rates, ranging from 8 to 24 kHz. Additionally, subjective human evaluations, scored using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) reveal that our method produces SSR with natural and human-like quality. Furthermore, Wave-U-Mamba achieves these results while generating high-resolution speech over nine times faster than baseline models on a single A100 GPU, with parameter sizes less than 2\% of those in the baseline models.</p>

            <h2>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Ohayon, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
            <p>Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p>

Then, we revise the simulation results of Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, and Fig. 15 in [1] to reaffirm the validity of the conclusions.</p>

This assessment enables us to identify domain-specific challenges and reveals that multimodal research in colonoscopy remains open for further exploration. To embrace the coming multimodal era, we establish three foundational initiatives: a large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset ColonINST, a colonoscopy-designed multimodal language model ColonGPT, and a multimodal benchmark.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo N. Ferreira, Marta Guimarães, Cláudia Soares</p>
            <p>The amount of debris in orbit has increased significantly over the years. With the recent growth of interest in space exploration, conjunction assessment has become a central issue. One important metric to evaluate conjunction risk is the miss distance. However, this metric does not intrinsically take into account uncertainty distributions. Some work has been developed to consider the uncertainty associated with the position of the orbiting objects, in particular, to know if these uncertainty distributions overlap (e.g., ellipsoids when considering Gaussian distributions). With this work, we present fast solutions to not only check if the ellipsoids overlap but to compute the distance between them, which we call margin. We present two fast solution methods for two different paradigms: when the best-known data from both objects can be centralized (e.g., debris-satellite conjunctions) and when the most precise covariances cannot be shared (conjunctions of satellites owned by different operators). Our methods are both accurate and fast, being able to process 15,000 conjunctions per minute with the centralized solution and approximately 490 conjunctions per minute with the distributed solution.</p>

            <p>In this article, we address aquatic environmental monitoring using a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Specifically, we develop an online path generator that provides either of circular or elliptic paths based on the real-time feedback so that the USVs efficiently sample the sensor data over given aquatic environment. To this end, we begin by formulating a novel online path generation problem for a group of Dubins vehicles in the form of cost minimization based on the formulation of persistent coverage control. We then transform the cost minimization into a constraint-based specification so that a prescribed performance level is certified. An online coverage path generator is then designed based on the so-called constraint-based control in order to meet the performance certificate together with additional constraints inherent in the parameters that specify the paths. It is also shown there that the present constraint-based approach allows one to drastically reduce the computational complexity stemming from combinations of binary variables corresponding to the turning directions of the USVs. The present coverage path generator is finally demonstrated through simulations and experiments on an original testbed of multiple USVs.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a new framework for synchronization of heterogeneous multi agent system which we refer to as weak synchronization. This new framework of synchronization is based on achieving the network stability in the absence of any information on communication network including the connectivity. Here by network stability, we mean that in the basic setup of a multi-agent system, we require that the signals exchanged over the network converge to zero. As such if the network happens to have a directed spanning tree then we obtain classical synchronization. Moreover, we design protocols which achieve weak synchronization for any network without making any kind of assumptions on communication network. If the network happens to have a directed spanning tree, then we obtain classical synchronization. However, if this is not the case then we describe in detail in this paper what kind of synchronization properties are preserved in the system and the output of the different agents can behave.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianzhe Chen, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan, Cheng-Xiang Wang, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) has attracted extensive research attention due to its potential to meet the increasingly demanding requirements of future communication systems. Meanwhile, recent researches have indicated that sparse arrays may offer promising advantages for XL-MIMO systems in the near-field. Motivated by these, this paper investigates a downlink near-field XL-MIMO communication system with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper focuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point of the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the x-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power distributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length of the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper. Furthermore, the numerical results reveals the improvement in the performance of XL-MIMO systems with the use of sparse UPAs.</p>

A promising solution is the TDE: an event-based processing element which encodes the time difference between events on different channels into an output event stream. In this work we introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to device mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is crucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same die, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate data produced by event-driven sensors.</p>

            <p>Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance.

            <h2>Calibrating Wireless AI via Meta-Learned Context-Dependent Conformal Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seonghoon Yoo, Sangwoo Park, Petar Popovski, Joonhyuk Kang, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
            <p>Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.</p>

            <p>To ensure the authenticity of navigation data, Galileo Open Service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) requires loose synchronization between the receiver clock and the system time. This means that during the period between clock calibrations, the receiver clock error needs to be smaller than a pre-defined threshold, currently up to 165s for OSNMA. On the other hand, relying on the PVT solution to steer the receiver clock or correct its bias may not be possible since this would depend on the very same signals we intend to authenticate. This work aims to investigate the causes of the frequency accuracy loss leading to clock errors and to build a model that, from the datasheet of a real-time clock (RTC) device, allows to bound the error clock during a certain period. The model's main contributors are temperature changes, long-term aging, and offset at calibration, but it includes other factors. We then apply the model to several RTCs from different manufacturers and bound the maximum error for certain periods, with a focus on the two-year between-calibration period expected for the smart tachograph, an automotive application that will integrate OSNMA.</p>

            <p>Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</p>

            <p>Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</p>

            <h2>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Architecture Designs, Opportunities, and Outlook</h2>

            <p>This article proposes a novel design for the Pinching Antenna SyStems (PASS) and advocates simple yet efficient wireless communications over the ``last meter''. First, the potential benefits of PASS are discussed in the paper by reviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced, including their physical principles, signal models, and communication designs. In contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept, termed \emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Based on this concept, a couple of practical transmission architectures are proposed for realizing the full potentia of PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More particularly, 1) the non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple baseband signal processing and relies on the pinching beamforming only; while 2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal processing capabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which can be further divided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based fully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put forward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further advance, by demonstrating a few numerical case studies, the significant performance gain of PASS is revealed compared to conventional multi-antenna systems. Finally, several research opportunities and open problems of PASS are highlighted.</p>

            <h2>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Subspace Identification for Stochastic Systems Using Multiple Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Sun</p>
            <p>This paper is concerned with the analysis of identification errors for $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with $m$ outputs and no external inputs, using Subspace Identification Methods (SIM) with finite sample data. We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</p>

            <h2>Remote Blood Oxygen Estimation From Videos Using Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Mathew, Xin Tian, Min Wu, Chau-Wai Wong</p>
            <p>Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an essential indicator of respiratory functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$ using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on. We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$ measurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand on SpO$_2$ estimation performance.</p>

            <h2>Near-Optimal Performance of Stochastic Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sungho Shin, Sen Na, Mihai Anitescu</p>
            <p>This article presents a dynamic regret analysis for stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) in linear systems with quadratic performance index and additive and multiplicative uncertainties. Under a finite support assumption, the problem can be cast as a finite-dimensional quadratic program, but the problem becomes quickly intractable as the problem size grows exponentially in the horizon length. SMPC aims to compute approximate solutions by solving a sequence of problems with truncated prediction horizons and committing the solution in a receding-horizon fashion. While this approach is widely used in practice, its performance relative to the optimal solution is not well understood. This article reports for the first time a rigorous near-optimal performance guarantee of SMPC: Under stabilizability and detectability conditions, the dynamic regret of SMPC is exponentially small in the prediction horizon length, allowing SMPC to achieve near-optimal performance at a substantially reduced computational expense.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingliang Duan, Wenxuan Wang, Liming Xiao, Jiaxin Gao, Shengbo Eben Li, Chang Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Bo Cheng, Keqiang Li</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex decision-making and control tasks. However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Jarne Ornia, Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Jens Kober, Javier Alonso-Mora</p>
            <p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Schmid, Tomer Raviv, Nir Shlezinger, Laurent Schmalen</p>
            <p>We investigate the application of the factor graph framework for blind joint channel estimation and symbol detection on time-variant linear inter-symbol interference channels. In particular, we consider the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, which typically suffers from high complexity as it requires the computation of the symbol-wise posterior distributions in every iteration. We address this issue by efficiently approximating the posteriors using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a suitable factor graph. By interweaving the iterations of BP and EM, the detection complexity can be further reduced to a single BP iteration per EM step. In addition, we propose a data-driven version of our algorithm that introduces momentum in the BP updates and learns a suitable EM parameter update schedule, thereby significantly improving the performance-complexity tradeoff with a few offline training samples. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed blind detector and show that it even outperforms coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</p>

            <p>Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for shaping the propagation environment, it consists of a single-layer structure within inherent limitations regarding the number of beam steering patterns. Based on the recently revolutionary technology, denoted as stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), we propose its implementation not only on the base station (BS) side in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup but also in the intermediate space between the base station and the users to adjust the environment further as needed. For the sake of convenience, we call the former BS SIM (BSIM), and the latter channel SIM (CSIM). Hence, we achieve wave-based combining at the BS and wave-based configuration at the intermediate space. Specifically, we propose a channel estimation method with reduced overhead, being crucial for SIMassisted communications. Next, we derive the uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Notably, we optimize the phase shifts of both BSIM and CSIM simultaneously by using the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM). Compared to previous works on SIMs, we study the uplink transmission, a mMIMO setup, channel estimation in a single phase, a second SIM at the intermediate space, and simultaneous optimization of the two SIMs. Simulation results show the impact of various parameters on the sum SE, and demonstrate the superiority of our optimization approach compared to the alternating optimization (AO) method.</p>

            <p>Deep learning (DL) has greatly advanced audio classification, yet the field is limited by the scarcity of large-scale benchmark datasets that have propelled progress in other domains. While AudioSet is a pivotal step to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and limited range of evaluation use cases challenge its role as the sole resource. Therefore, we introduce \texttt{BirdSet}, a large-scale benchmark dataset for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. \texttt{BirdSet} surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours~($\uparrow\!17\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes~($\uparrow\!18\times$) for training and more than 400 hours~($\uparrow\!7\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluation use cases in audio classification. We host our dataset on Hugging Face for easy accessibility and offer an extensive codebase to reproduce our results.</p>

            <p>We introduce Self-Monitored Inference-Time INtervention (SMITIN), an approach for controlling an autoregressive generative music transformer using classifier probes. These simple logistic regression probes are trained on the output of each attention head in the transformer using a small dataset of audio examples both exhibiting and missing a specific musical trait (e.g., the presence/absence of drums, or real/synthetic music). We then steer the attention heads in the probe direction, ensuring the generative model output captures the desired musical trait. Additionally, we monitor the probe output to avoid adding an excessive amount of intervention into the autoregressive generation, which could lead to temporally incoherent music. We validate our results objectively and subjectively for both audio continuation and text-to-music applications, demonstrating the ability to add controls to large generative models for which retraining or even fine-tuning is impractical for most musicians. Audio samples of the proposed intervention approach are available on our demo page this http URL .</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liangzhi Wang, Chen Chen, Jie Zhang, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>This paper considers a downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network in which multiple multi-antenna access points (APs) serve multiple users via coherent joint transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each AP selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each AP, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the APs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</p>

            <p>Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. However, existing methods of evaluating their robustness are often limited to cross-referencing with existing literature, which is a subjective and inconsistent process. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques (specifically, feature attributors) have been applied to fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with an emphasis on evaluating the robustness of potential biomarkers produced for psychiatric disorders. Then, 65 studies using GNNs that reported potential fMRI biomarkers for psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) published before 9 October 2024 were identified from 2 online databases (Scopus, PubMed). We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies (as determined by feature attribution scores) vary greatly across studies on the same disorder. Reproducibility of biomarkers is only limited to a small subset at the level of regions and few transdiagnostic biomarkers were identified. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders via GNNs.</p>

            <h2>Optimal compressed sensing for image reconstruction with diffusion probabilistic models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Qi Zhang, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P. Simoncelli, David H. Brainard</p>
            <p>We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (generally known as a "diffusion model"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakhar Godara, Tilman Diego Aléman, Angela J. Yu</p>
            <p>\textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel method for emulating piano sounds. We propose to exploit the sines, transient, and noise decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer replicating piano notes. Three sub-modules learn these components from piano recordings and generate the corresponding harmonic, transient, and noise signals. Splitting the emulation into three independently trainable models reduces the modeling tasks' complexity. The quasi-harmonic content is produced using a differentiable sinusoidal model guided by physics-derived formulas, whose parameters are automatically estimated from audio recordings. The noise sub-module uses a learnable time-varying filter, and the transients are generated using a deep convolutional network. From singular notes, we emulate the coupling between different keys in trichords with a convolutional-based network. Results show the model matches the partial distribution of the target while predicting the energy in the higher part of the spectrum presents more challenges. The energy distribution in the spectra of the transient and noise components is accurate overall. While the model is more computationally and memory efficient, perceptual tests reveal limitations in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes. Despite this, it generally achieves perceptual accuracy in emulating single notes and trichords.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</p>

To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models.

This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, as one of the first in the symbolic music literature's demo pages that enables real-time interactive generation.</p>

We evaluate six machine learning (ML) classifiers - support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost - using grid search for feasible hyperparameters of selected classifiers and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classifier-feature subset combinations for each classifier type are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data. Our approach achieves outstanding performance, reaching 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectivelly. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data. This advancement demonstrates significant potential for clinical deployment of ML methods, offering a valuable supportive tool for an objective examination of voice pathologies.

            <p>Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p>

This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework constructed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery.

Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The Lightweight-Shared (LS) module is designed as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5\% and 67.6\% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters.

We compare segmentation outcomes with the winning algorithm from the PED BraTS 2023 challenge as the SOTA model. Our proposed algorithm achieved an average Dice score of 0.642 and an HD95 of 73.0 mm on the CBTN test data, outperforming the SOTA model, which achieved a Dice score of 0.626 and an HD95 of 84.0 mm. Moreover, our model exhibits strong generalizability, attaining a 0.877 Dice score in whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma dataset, surpassing existing SOTA. Our results indicate that the proposed model is a step towards providing more accurate segmentation for pediatric brain tumors, which is essential for evaluating therapy response and monitoring patient progress.</p>

            <h2>Learning Multiple Initial Solutions to Optimization Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elad Sharony, Heng Yang, Tong Che, Marco Pavone, Shie Mannor, Peter Karkus</p>
            <p>Sequentially solving similar optimization problems under strict runtime constraints is essential for many applications, such as robot control, autonomous driving, and portfolio management. The performance of local optimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution: poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose learning to predict \emph{multiple} diverse initial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We introduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a single-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen using a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where several optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a different solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by including a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final output is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization. We validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole, reacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and iLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all evaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number of initial solutions required.

            <h2>Learning and Reconstructing Conflicts in O-RAN: A Graph Neural Network Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arshia Zolghadr, Joao F. Santos, Luiz A. DaSilva, Jacek Kibiłda</p>
            <p>The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment of third-party applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, may result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven method for reconstructing and labeling conflict graphs in O-RAN. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, parameters, and KPIs. Our numerical results, based on a conflict model used in the O-RAN conflict management literature, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct conflict graphs and identify the conflicts defined by the O-RAN Alliance.</p>

            <h2>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianqi Shen, Shaohua Liu, Jiaqi Feng, Ziye Ma, Ning An</p>
            <p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p>

            <h2>Multiple testing in multi-stream sequential change detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjit Dandapanthula, Aaditya Ramdas</p>
            <p>Multi-stream sequential change detection involves simultaneously monitoring many streams of data and trying to detect when their distributions change, if at all. Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from detecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite average run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate (FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), per-family error rate (PFER), and global error rate (GER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is fundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL (which is typically necessary in order to have a small detection delay). One of our contributions is to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over patience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector framework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the recent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove that these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general dependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we prove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times and provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally, if finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the worst-case Type I error.</p>

            <h2>On Creating A Brain-To-Text Decoder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zenon Lamprou, Yashar Moshfeghi</p>
            <p>Brain decoding has emerged as a rapidly advancing and extensively utilized technique within neuroscience. This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</p>

            <h2>Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Kruspe</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p>

            <h2>DyPCL: Dynamic Phoneme-level Contrastive Learning for Dysarthric Speech Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wonjun Lee, Solee Im, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Jungseul Ok, Gary Geunbae Lee</p>
            <p>Dysarthric speech recognition often suffers from performance degradation due to the intrinsic diversity of dysarthric severity and extrinsic disparity from normal speech. To bridge these gaps, we propose a Dynamic Phoneme-level Contrastive Learning (DyPCL) method, which leads to obtaining invariant representations across diverse speakers. We decompose the speech utterance into phoneme segments for phoneme-level contrastive learning, leveraging dynamic connectionist temporal classification alignment. Unlike prior studies focusing on utterance-level embeddings, our granular learning allows discrimination of subtle parts of speech. In addition, we introduce dynamic curriculum learning, which progressively transitions from easy negative samples to difficult-to-distinguishable negative samples based on phonetic similarity of phoneme. Our approach to training by difficulty levels alleviates the inherent variability of speakers, better identifying challenging speeches. Evaluated on the UASpeech dataset, DyPCL outperforms baseline models, achieving an average 22.10\% relative reduction in word error rate (WER) across the overall dysarthria group.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Wagner, Alexander Churchill, Siddharth Sigtia, Erik Marchi</p>
            <p>In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Bidding Curves for Renewable Energy in Two-Settlement Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongwei Zhao, Stefanos Delikaraogloub, Vladimir Dvorkin Alberto J. Lamadrid L., Audun Botterud</p>
            <p>Coordination of day-ahead and real-time electricity markets is imperative for cost-effective electricity supply and also to provide efficient incentives for the energy transition. Although stochastic market designs feature the least-cost coordination, they are incompatible with current deterministic markets. This paper proposes a new approach for compatible coordination in two-settlement markets based on benchmark bidding curves for variable renewable energy. These curves are optimized based on a bilevel optimization problem, anticipating per-scenario responses of deterministic market-clearing problems and ultimately minimizing the expected cost across day-ahead and real-time markets. Although the general bilevel model is challenging to solve, we theoretically prove that a single-segment bidding curve with a zero bidding price is sufficient to achieve system optimality if the marginal cost of variable renewable energy is zero, thus addressing the computational challenge. In practice, variable renewable energy producers can be allowed to bid multi-segment curves with non-zero prices. We test the bilevel framework for both single- and multiple-segment bidding curves under the assumption of fixed bidding prices. We leverage duality theory and McCormick envelopes to derive the linear programming approximation of the bilevel problem, which scales to practical systems such as a 1576-bus NYISO system. We benchmark the proposed coordination and find absolute dominance over the baseline solution, which assumes that renewables agnostically bid their expected forecasts. We also demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides a good approximation of the least-cost, yet unattainable in practice, stochastic market outcome.</p>

Instead of direct decision-making, LLMs generate and refine executable control policies through a meta-policy that guides task generation and a base policy for operational actions. Applied to a simplified microgrid scenario, the approach achieves up to 15 percent cost savings by iteratively improving battery control strategies. The proposed methodology lays a foundation for integrating LLM-based tools into planning and control tasks, offering adaptable and scalable solutions for complex systems while addressing challenges of uncertainty and reproducibility.</p>

            <p>The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</p>

            <h2>UAV-Assisted MEC Architecture for Collaborative Task Offloading in Urban IoT Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhrajit Barick, Chetna Singhal</p>
            <p>Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to meet the increasing demands and computing limitations of complex Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, implementing MEC in urban environments can be challenging due to factors like high device density, complex infrastructure, and limited network coverage. Network congestion and connectivity issues can adversely affect user satisfaction. Hence, in this article, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted collaborative MEC architecture to facilitate task offloading of IoT devices in urban environments. We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs and ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also maximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as joint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem. Due to NP-hard nature, we break the problem into two subproblems: offload strategy optimization and UAV topology optimization. We develop a Three-sided Matching with Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find stable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We also propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number of UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed task offloading scheme over benchmark schemes through simulation-based evaluation. The proposed scheme outperforms by 19%, 12%, and 25% on average in terms of percentage of served IoTs, average user satisfaction, and SP profit, respectively, with 25% lesser UAVs, making it an effective solution to support IoT task requirements in urban environments using UAV-assisted MEC architecture.</p>
