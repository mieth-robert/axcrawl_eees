            <h2>Pinching-Antenna Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixuan Li, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding</p>
            <p>This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable performance gain compared to conventional system.</p>

            <h2>DeltaDPD: Exploiting Dynamic Temporal Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Wideband Digital Predistortion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhuo Wu, Yi Zhu, Kun Qian, Qinyu Chen, Anding Zhu, John Gajadharsing, Leo C. N. de Vreede, Chang Gao</p>
            <p>Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment, contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on recurrent neural networks (RNN), whose computational complexity hinders system efficiency. This paper introduces DeltaDPD, exploring the dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and neuronal hidden states in RNNs for energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW 256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03 dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power. The DeltaDPD code will be released after formal publication at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Development of Reduced Feeder and Load Models Using Practical Topological and Loading Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sameer Nekkalapu, Sushrut Thakar, Antos Cheeramban Varghese, Vijay Vittal, Bo Gong, Ken Brown</p>
            <p>Distribution feeder and load model reduction methods are essential for maintaining a good tradeoff between accurate representation of grid behavior and reduced computational complexity in power system studies. An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper. Simulations conducted in this work show that the reduced feeder and load model of a utility feeder, obtained using the proposed method, can accurately capture contactor and motor stalling behaviors for critical events such as fault induced delayed voltage recovery.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Inverter Control Strategy with Power Decoupling for Microgrid Operations in Grid-Connected and Islanded Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Tong, Qin Wang, Aihong Tang</p>
            <p>Grid-forming, particularly those utilizing droop control and virtual synchronous generators (VSG), can actively regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrid systems, exhibiting dynamic characteristics akin to those of synchronous generators. Although droop control and VSG control each have distinct benefits, neither can fully meet the diverse, dynamic needs of both grid-connected (GC) and islanded (IS) modes. Additionally, the coupling between active and reactive power can negatively impact microgrids' dynamic performance and stability. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a unified dynamic power coupling (UDC) model. This model's active power control loop can be tailored to meet diverse requirements. By implementing a well-designed control loop, the system can harness the advantages of both droop control and VSG control. In islanded mode, the proposed model can provide virtual inertia and damping properties, while in grid-connected mode, the inverter's active power output can follow the changed references without significant overshoot or oscillation. Furthermore, the model incorporates coupling compensation and virtual impedance based on a relative gain array in the frequency domain to facilitate quantitative analysis of power coupling characteristics. This paper outlines a distinct design process for the unified model. Finally, the proposed control method has been validated through simulation.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Current Control Strategy for Reliable Power Electronics Converters: Frequency-Domain Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Rezaeizadeh, Silvia Mastellone</p>
            <p>Power electronics converters are key enablers in the global energy transition for power generation, industrial and mobility applications; they convert electrical power in a controlled, reliable and efficient manner. The semiconductor switching devices, at the core of power converters, are the most likely component to fail due to the damage caused by the current-induced temperature cycling. Damage models of semiconductors have been developed and employed to study their reliability, improve their design and to estimate the lifetime of the converter in various power applications. However, those models can offer more if employed in the design of strategies to actively operate the converter. Specifically, properly controlling the current, and hence the temperature cycling, can effectively contribute to reducing the accumulated damage in the semiconductor and increase its reliability and lifetime. In this paper we propose a novel current control approach that integrates reliability requirements into the design framework, based on a frequency-domain model of the semiconductor damage.</p>

            <h2>Extended Convex Hull-Based Distributed Optimal Energy Flow of Integrated Electricity-Gas Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong-Peng Liu, Wei Sun, Dali Zhou, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>Integrated electricity and gas systems are constructed to facilitate the gas-fired generation, and the distributed operation of these integrated systems have received much attention due to the increased emphasis on data security and privacy between different agencies. This paper proposes an extended convex hull based method to address optimal energy flow problems for the integrated electricity and gas systems in a distributed manner. First, a multi-block electricity-gas system model is constructed by dividing the whole system into N blocks considering both physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with the extended convex hullbased constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution for the convexified model is checked, and a sufficient condition is developed. If the sufficient condition is satisfied, the optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem can be recovered from that for the convexified problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is tractable and effective in obtaining feasible optimal solutions for multi-block optimal energy flow problems.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zeng, Xingwang Li, Ji Wang, Gaojian Huang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding</p>
            <p>The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyang Wang, Xin Chen</p>
            <p>The large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources presents significant challenges to maintaining power balance and nominal frequency in modern power systems. This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <h2>Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 6G: Vision, Opportunity and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Marco Mezzavilla, Sundeep Rangan, Theodore Rappaport, Marwa Chafii</p>
            <p>Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this \textcolor{black}{never-before} used spectrum by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity (e.g. data rate) tradeoffs, while also examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output, compact and digital architectures, and evaluate the potential of multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</p>

            <h2>Tight Finite Time Bounds of Two-Time-Scale Linear Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaan Ul Haque, Sajad Khodadadian, Siva Theja Maguluri</p>
            <p>Stochastic approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm for finding the fixed point of an operator using noisy samples and widely used in optimization and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The noise in RL exhibits a Markovian structure, and in some cases, such as gradient temporal difference (GTD) methods, SA is employed in a two-time-scale framework. This combination introduces significant theoretical challenges for analysis. We derive an upper bound on the error for the iterations of linear two-time-scale SA with Markovian noise. We demonstrate that the mean squared error decreases as $trace (\Sigma^y)/k + o(1/k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterates, and $\Sigma^y$ is an appropriately defined covariance matrix. A key feature of our bounds is that the leading term, $\Sigma^y$, exactly matches with the covariance in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the two-time-scale SA, and we call them tight finite-time bounds. We illustrate their use in RL by establishing sample complexity for off-policy algorithms, TDC, GTD, and GTD2. A special case of linear two-time-scale SA that is extensively studied is linear SA with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. We present tight finite time bounds corresponding to the covariance matrix of the CLT. Such bounds can be used to study TD-learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging.</p>

            <h2>OccuEMBED: Occupancy Extraction Merged with Building Energy Disaggregation for Occupant-Responsive Operation at Scale</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yufei Zhang (1), Andrew Sonta (1) ((1) ETHOS Lab, EPFL-ENAC-IIC)</p>
            <p>Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noor ul Misbah Khanum, Hayssam Dahrouj, Ramesh C. Bansal, Hissam Mouayad Tawfik</p>
            <p>Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS, namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability, data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of future AI-based EMS.</p>

            <h2>Connected C-Core Hybrid SRMs for EV Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gholamreza Davarpanah, Sajjad Mohammadi</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a new class of permanent magnet-assisted three-phase switched reluctance motors (PM-SRMs) designed to achieve significantly higher torque density for electric vehicle (EV) propulsion systems. Eight distinct motor topologies are systematically investigated, including a non-PM baseline design, three innovative PM arrangement strategies, and two optimized rotor/stator teeth configurations (22-pole and 26-pole variants). The study presents analytical models including magnetic equivalent circuits (MECs), detailed operating principles, and generalized design formulations that account for both electromagnetic and structural considerations. A key contribution is the introduction of the point-of-conversion (PoC) concept, which optimizes PM placement by minimizing magnetic path reluctance. Comparative analysis demonstrates torque density improvements over conventional SRMs and existing PM-assisted designs while maintaining structural robustness. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed 24/22 configuration with inter-phase PMs delivers higher torque per PM volume compared to state-of-the-art designs. The findings provide insights for EV motor designers seeking to balance performance, cost, and reliability.</p>

            <h2>Human-in-the-Loop AI for HVAC Management Enhancing Comfort and Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Liang, Frits de Nijs, Buser Say, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings, offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic and environmental goals.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Building Thermal Flexibility Into Distribution System: A Privacy-Preserved Dispatch Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Lu, Zeyin Hou, Wei Gu, Yijun Xu</p>
            <p>The inherent thermal storage capacity of buildings brings considerable thermal flexibility to the heating/cooling loads, which are promising demand response resources for power systems. It is widely believed that integrating the thermal flexibility of buildings into the distribution system can improve the operating economy and reliability of the system. However, the private information of the buildings needs to be transferred to the distribution system operator (DSO) to achieve a coordinated optimization, bringing serious privacy concerns to users. Given this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserved optimal dispatch approach for the distribution system incorporating buildings. Using it, the DSO can exploit the thermal flexibility of buildings without accessing their private information, such as model parameters and indoor temperature profiles. Specifically, we first develop an optimal dispatch model for the distribution system integrating buildings, which can be extended to other storage-like flexibility resources. Second, we reveal that the privacy-preserved integration of buildings is a joint privacy preservation problem for both parameters and state variables and then design a privacy-preserved algorithm based on transformation-based encryption, constraint relaxation, and constraint extension techniques. Besides, we implement a detailed privacy analysis for the proposed method, considering both semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Case studies demonstrate the accuracy, privacy-preserved performance, and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Shortlisting Protection Configurations for HVDC Grids and Electrical Energy Hubs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merijn Van Deyck, Geraint Chaffey, Dirk Van Hertem</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a methodology for shortlisting protection system configurations for large HVDC switching stations, which are expected in multiterminal HVDC grids and electrical energy hubs (or energy islands). This novel approach focuses on the configuration of protection equipment and the arrangement of lines and converters in various protection zones, instead of expert decisions on protection strategies based on numerous simulations. A graph-based approach that allows high-level evaluation of possible DC fault impacts is presented. This fault impact evaluation method can evaluate many possible protection configurations allowing the selection of less obvious choices, as experts cannot consider all possible configurations, especially when the switching station size increases. A filtering process is applied to reduce the number of possible configurations based on multiple protection performance metrics which are evaluated for different power flow scenarios. The results for these performance metrics can be compared for configurations with different numbers of HVDC circuit breakers to assess the benefit of increasing the amount of protection equipment in different network topologies. It is also shown that, through continued filtering using additional performance metrics or fault scenarios, the number of possible breaker, cable and converter configurations can be further reduced, leading to a protection design that is well suited for many operational scenarios. The results of the shortlisting process provide insights on the required number of HVDC circuit breakers to limit fault impacts to a given value. Moreover, observed trends in the results could, in future studies, contribute to new design principles and priorities, allowing system developers to more effectively design HVDC protection systems for different operational scenarios and possible investment levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uyoata E. Uyoata, Gilberto Berardinelli, Ramoni Adeogun</p>
            <p>In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios, effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane, often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages. The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irina Zettl, Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Florian Schmidtke, Lukas Ortmann, Andreas Ulbig</p>
            <p>Coordinating a high number of flexibility providing units (e.g. to provide ancillary services for the transmission system) across various grid layers requires new control concepts. A flexibility request at a point of common coupling can be met by utilizing a cascaded control structure based on online feedback optimization. In this paper the influence of the parameterization of the individual controllers on the performance of the hierarchical flexibility provision is studied on a three-level test system. The results show a high interdependency between the choice of control parameters of one controller and the behavior of other controllers as well as a significant impact on the accuracy and speed of flexibility provision. With a careful tuning, a cascaded structure based on online feedback optimization can achieve efficient vertical coordination of flexibility providing units.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p>

            <h2>Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price Balancing Scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Bruninx, Timothy Verstraeten, Jalal Kazempour, Jan Helsen</p>
            <p>We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</p>

            <h2>LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wangkun Xu, Zhongda Chu, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

            <h2>Optimal Microgrid Sizing of Offshore Renewable Energy Sources for Offshore Platforms and Coastal Communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara</p>
            <p>The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards renewable energy and advanced storage solutions, driven by the urgent need for sustainable and resilient power systems. Isolated offshore communities, such as islands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or diesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy integration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines, wave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired with a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper introduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to identify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for offshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting for battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a deep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in variables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge, depth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions demonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while maintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design solution for offshore microgrid systems.</p>

            <h2>Predictive Control of EV Overnight Charging with Multi-Session Flexibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Wieberneit, Emanuele Crisostomi, Anthony Quinn, Robert Shorten</p>
            <p>The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight, where the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus representing a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control algorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require full charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of surplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of controlled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug, scheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over prediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising model predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK National Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions with multi-session planning of 40 to 46\% compared to uncontrolled charging and 19 to 26\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the driving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility and consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid carbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant variations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.</p>

            <h2>Max-Min Secrecy Rate and Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for RIS-Aided VLC Systems: RSMA Versus NOMA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Maraqa, Sylvester Aboagye, Majid H. Khoshafa, Telex M. N. Ngatched</p>
            <p>Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution. Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE performances are provided.</p>

            <h2>Learning Economic Model Predictive Control via Clustering and Kernel-Based Lipschitz Regression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiliang Xiong, Defeng He, Haiping Du</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel learning economic model predictive control scheme for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to input and state constraints and unknown dynamics. We design a fast and accurate Lipschitz regression method using input and output data that combines clustering and kernel regression to learn the unknown dynamics. In each cluster, the parallel convex optimization problems are solved to estimate the kernel weights and reduce the Lipschitz constant of the predictor, hence limiting the error propagation in the prediction horizon. We derive the two different bounds of learning errors in deterministic and probabilistic forms and customize a new robust constraint-tightening strategy for the discontinuous predictor. Then, the learning economic model predictive control algorithm is formulated by introducing a stabilized optimization problem to construct a Lyapunov function. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations of a numerical example and a continuously stirred tank reactor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binesh Sadanandan, Bahareh Arghavani Nobar, Vahid Behzadan</p>
            <p>The medical device industry has significantly advanced by integrating sophisticated electronics like microchips and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to enhance the safety and usability of life-saving devices. These complex electro-mechanical systems, however, introduce challenging failure modes that are not easily detectable with conventional methods. Effective fault detection and mitigation become vital as reliance on such electronics grows. This paper explores three generative machine learning-based approaches for fault detection in medical devices, leveraging sensor data from surgical staplers,a class 2 medical device. Historically considered low-risk, these devices have recently been linked to an increasing number of injuries and fatalities. The study evaluates the performance and data requirements of these machine-learning approaches, highlighting their potential to enhance device safety.</p>

            <p>Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover. The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud cover of 87.5%</p>

            <h2>Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yushan Li, Jianping He, Dimos V. Dimarogonas</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Energy Efficient RSMA-Based LEO Satellite Communications Assisted by UAV-Mounted BD-Active RIS: A DRL Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahman Saadat Yeganeh, Hamid Behroozi</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an advanced non-terrestrial communication architecture that integrates Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) with a Beyond-Diagonal Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-ARIS) mounted on a UAV under the coverage of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The BD-ARIS adopts a group-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability, while RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common and private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV positioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and high-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of both the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that TRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate, especially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3 converges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C suffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness of each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is evaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the proposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional RIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G and massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Protective Relays: A Perspective for Current Limiting Control Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Li, Heng Wu, Xiongfei Wang</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters can significantly alter the fault characteristics of power systems, which challenges the proper function of protective relays. This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction between GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in protective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is revealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current reference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising elements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting highly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of such elements. This finding provides insights into the design of CLC for GFM IBRs from a protection perspective. It is further found that even with a highly inductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced by the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based supervising elements. These theoretical findings are corroborated by simulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests.</p>

            <h2>Integrated equilibrium model for electrified logistics and power systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Yao, Xuhang Liu, Anna Scaglione, Shlomo Bekhor, Kenan Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the complex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power delivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified logistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to maximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric delivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the locational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and charging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov decision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to achieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other hand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal e-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the integrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild assumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's fixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this paper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve sustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bodong Shang, Zheng Wang, Xiangyu Li, Chungang Yang, Chao Ren, Haijun Zhang</p>
            <p>To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</p>

            <p>This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</p>

            <p>Real-time tracking of inertia is important because it reflects the power system's ability to withstand contingencies and maintain frequency security. This paper proposes a practical approach to estimate inertia using ambient phasor measurement unit (PMU) data and a partitioned form of the swing equation. The approach accounts for (bounded) uncertainties in network parameters and PMU measurements, enabling precise estimation of inertia and damping constants, as well as mechanical power inputs. Instead of assuming constant mechanical power input throughout, the approach leverages knowledge of power system operations to determine intervals when it is actually constant to maintain estimation consistency. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 39 bus system integrated with renewable energy sources affirm the method's accuracy and applicability.</p>

            <h2>Power Loss and Temperature Distribution in Coil of PFC Inductor with Air Gap for Multimode Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafal Kasikowski</p>
            <p>Power converters inherently display non-linear load characteristics, resulting in a high level of mains harmonics, and hence the necessity of implementing Power Factor Correction (PFC). Active PFC circuitry typically comprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current so that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of the waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC inductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and investigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a combination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC inductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion and, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This paper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct power-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency eddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As demonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level, exhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to the somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing magnetic flux at an air gap. The latter assertion will undergo further, more quantitatively focused research. Finally, the construction of the coil was optimised to reduce power loss by diminishing eddy-current mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongjin Du, Tuanku Badzlin Hashfi, Rashmi Prasad, Pedro P. Vergara, Peter Palensky, Aleksandra Lekić</p>
            <p>With the growing integration of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems, there is an increasing need for control strategies that ensure both economic efficiency and robust dynamic performance. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework for hybrid AC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel droop control strategy that coordinates DC voltage and AC frequency regulation. By embedding frequency control loops into the MMCs, the method enables system-wide coordination, enhancing power sharing and improving system resilience under disturbances. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts converter operating points to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations, thus balancing economic objectives with system stability. A modified Nordic test system integrated with a four-terminal MTDC grid is used to validate the approach. Optimization is performed using Julia, while the system's dynamic performance is evaluated through electromagnetic transient simulations with the EMTP software. Case studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower generation costs than active power control and adaptive droop control strategy while maintaining stable control characteristics. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver cost-effective operation without compromising performance, offering a promising solution for the coordinated control of future hybrid AC-DC transmission networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nanda Kishor Panda, Simon H. Tindemans</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV growth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probabilistic ability to offer different flexibility products, namely, redispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed for different categories of charging stations (CS) and dispatch strategies. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. Further, it is shown how machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the day-ahead consumption, followed by operationally predicting redispatch flexibility. The findings demonstrate that the timing of EV arrivals, departures, and connections plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of product offerings, and dependable services can generally be delivered using a sufficiently large number of CSs.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control strategy for achieving precise and robust output voltage regulation in LCC-S resonant converters, specifically designed for wireless power transfer applications. Unlike conventional methods that rely on manually tuned PI controllers or heuristic tuning approaches, our method leverages the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to systematically optimize PI controller parameters. The complex converter dynamics are captured using the Direct Piecewise Affine (DPWA) modeling technique, providing a structured approach to handling its nonlinearities. This integration not only eliminates the need for manual tuning, but also enhances control adaptability under varying operating conditions. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed DRL-based tuning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability, robustness, and response time. This work demonstrates the potential of DRL in power electronic control, offering a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional controller design approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walter Zibusiso Ncube, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani</p>
            <p>Driven by the exponential growth in data traffic and the limitations of Radio Frequency (RF) networks, Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for high data rate communication. However, the inherently dynamic nature of OWC environments resulting from user mobility, and time-varying user demands poses significant challenges for enhanced and sustainable performance. Energy efficiency (EE) is a critical metric for the sustainable operation of next generation wireless networks. Achieving high EE in dynamic OWC environments, especially under time-varying user distributions and heterogeneous service requirements, remains a complex task. In this work, we formulate a discrete-time EE optimisation problem in a dynamic OWC to maximise energy efficiency through determining user connectivity and power allocation. Solving this problem in real time is computationally demanding due to the coupling of user association and power allocation variables over discrete time slots. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Prediction and Optimised Power Allocation (PDP-OPA) framework which predicts user arrivals, departures, and traffic demands. Based on these predictions, the framework proactively determines AP-user associations and allocates power dynamically using a Lagrangian-based optimisation strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDP-OPA significantly enhances system performance, providing solutions close to the optimal ones. The proposed framework improves energy efficiency, sum rate, and bit error rate (BER) compared to distance-based user association and uniform power allocation, validating its effectiveness for real time and adaptive resource management in dynamic OWC systems.</p>

            <h2>Energy Efficiency Maximization for CR-NOMA based Smart Grid Communication Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mubashar Sarfraz, Sheraz Alam, Sajjad A. Ghauri, Asad Mahmood</p>
            <p>Managing massive data flows effectively and resolving spectrum shortages are two challenges that Smart Grid Communication Networks (SGCN) must overcome. To address these problems, we provide a combined optimization approach that makes use of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technologies. Our work focuses on using user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) techniques to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in SGCN, particularly within Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs). We develop a joint optimization problem that takes into account the real-world limitations of a CR-NOMA setting. This problem is NP-hard, nonlinear, and nonconvex by nature. To address the computational complexity of the problem, we use the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, which breaks the problem into UP and PA subproblems. Initially, we proposed the Zebra-Optimization User Pairing (ZOUP) algorithm to tackle the UP problem, which outperforms both Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and non-optimized NOMA (UPWO) by 78.8\% and 13.6\%, respectively, at a SNR of 15 dB. Based on the ZOUP pairs, we subsequently proposed the PA approach, i.e., ZOUPPA, which significantly outperforms UPWO and ZOUP by 53.2\% and 25.4\%, respectively, at an SNR of 15 dB. A detailed analysis of key parameters, including varying SNRs, power allocation constants, path loss exponents, user density, channel availability, and coverage radius, underscores the superiority of our approach. By facilitating the effective use of communication resources in SGCN, our research opens the door to more intelligent and energy-efficient grid systems. Our work tackles important issues in SGCN and lays the groundwork for future developments in smart grid communication technologies by combining modern optimization approaches with CR-NOMA.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven Energy Modeling of Industrial IoT Systems: A Benchmarking Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Kallis, Moysis Symeonides, Marios D. Dikaiakos</p>
            <p>The widespread adoption of IoT has driven the development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in industrial environments, leveraging Industrial IoTs (IIoTs) to automate manufacturing processes and enhance productivity. The transition to autonomous systems introduces significant operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. Accurate modeling and prediction of IIoT energy requirements are critical, but traditional physics- and engineering-based approaches often fall short in addressing these challenges comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for benchmarking and analyzing IIoT devices and applications to uncover insights into their power demands, energy consumption, and performance. To demonstrate this methodology, we develop a comprehensive framework and apply it to study an industrial CPS comprising an educational robotic arm, a conveyor belt, a smart camera, and a compute node. By creating micro-benchmarks and an end-to-end application within this framework, we create an extensive performance and power consumption dataset, which we use to train and analyze ML models for predicting energy usage from features of the application and the CPS system. The proposed methodology and framework provide valuable insights into the energy dynamics of industrial CPS, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of IIoT-driven automation.</p>

            <p>Second language proficiency (L2) in English is usually perceptually evaluated by English teachers or expert evaluators, with the inherent intra- and inter-rater variability. This paper explores deep learning techniques for comprehensive L2 proficiency assessment, addressing both the speech signal and its correspondent transcription. We analyze spoken proficiency classification prediction using diverse architectures, including 2D CNN, frequency-based CNN, ResNet, and a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model. Additionally, we examine text-based proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust automated L2 proficiency evaluation.</p>

            <p>This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</p>

            <h2>Defense Strategies for Autonomous Multi-agent Systems: Ensuring Safety and Resilience Under Exponentially Unbounded FDI Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichao Wang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Dimitra Panagou, Shan Zuo</p>
            <p>False data injection attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). Existing attack-resilient control strategies generally have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and solving the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, an attack-resilient compensational signal is designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Finally, a SAAR controller is designed by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem integrating control barrier function (CBF) certified collision-free safety constraints. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for heterogeneous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Schynol, Marius Pesavento</p>
            <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Sabot, Pierre-Etienne Labeau, Pierre Henneaux</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel methodology for probabilistic dynamic security assessment and enhancement of power systems that considers load and generation variability, N-2 contingencies, and uncertain cascade propagation caused by uncertain protection system behaviour. In this methodology, a database of likely operating conditions is generated via weather data, a market model and a model of operators' preventive actions. System states are sampled from this database and contingencies are applied to them to perform the security assessment. Rigorous statistical indicators are proposed to decide how many biased and unbiased samples to simulate to reach a target accuracy on the statistical error on the estimated risk from individual contingencies. Optionally, a screening of contingencies can be performed to limit the computational burden of the analysis. Finally, interpretable machine learning techniques are used to identify the root causes of the risk from critical contingencies, to ease the interpretation of the results, and to help with security enhancement. The method is demonstrated on the 73-bus reliability test system, and the scalability to large power systems (with thousands of buses) is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>One Target, Many Views: Multi-User Fusion for Collaborative Uplink ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>We propose a novel pilot-free multi-user uplink framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mm-wave networks, where single-antenna users transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals without dedicated pilots. The base station exploits the spatial and velocity diversities of users to simultaneously decode messages and detect targets, transforming user transmissions into a powerful sensing tool. Each user's signal, structured by a known codebook, propagates through a sparse multi-path channel with shared moving targets and user-specific scatterers. Notably, common targets induce distinct delay-Doppler-angle signatures, while stationary scatterers cluster in parameter space. We formulate the joint multi-path parameter estimation and data decoding as a 3D super-resolution problem, extracting delays, Doppler shifts, and angles-of-arrival via atomic norm minimization, efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. A core innovation is multiuser fusion, where diverse user observations are collaboratively combined to enhance sensing and decoding. This approach improves robustness and integrates multi-user perspectives into a unified estimation framework, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable communication. Numerical results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances both target estimation and communication performance, highlighting its potential for next-generation ISAC systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Al-Shafei, Nima Amjady, Hamidreza Zareipour, Yankai Cao</p>
            <p>This work introduces the category of Power System Transition Planning optimization problem. It aims to shift power systems to emissions-free networks efficiently. Unlike comparable work, the framework presented here broadly applies to the industry's decision-making process. It defines a field-appropriate functional boundary focused on the economic efficiency of power systems. Namely, while imposing a wide range of planning factors in the decision space, the model maintains the structure and depth of conventional power system planning under uncertainty, which leads to a large-scale multistage stochastic programming formulation that encounters intractability in real-life cases. Thus, the framework simultaneously invokes high-performance computing defaultism. In this comprehensive exposition, we present a guideline model, comparing its scope to existing formulations, supported by a fully detailed example problem, showcasing the analytical value of the solution gained in a small test case. Then, the framework's viability for realistic applications is demonstrated by solving an extensive test case based on a realistic planning construct consistent with Alberta's power system practices for long-term planning studies. The framework resorts to Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming as a decomposition method to achieve tractability, leveraging High-Performance Computing and parallel computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swetha Rani Kasimalla, Kuchan Park, Junho Hong, Young-Jin Kim, HyoJong Lee</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and communication networks has brought both modernization and new vulnerabilities to the power system infrastructure. These vulnerabilities expose the system to internal faults and cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, which can closely mimic real fault scenarios. Hence, this work presents a two-stage fault and cyberattack detection framework tailored for inverter-based microgrids. Stage 1 introduces an unsupervised learning model Feature Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN), to distinguish between genuine internal faults and cyber-induced anomalies in microgrids. Compared to conventional GAN architectures, F2GAN demonstrates improved system diagnosis and greater adaptability to zero-day attacks through its feature-feedback mechanism. In Stage 2, supervised machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to localize and classify faults within inverter switches, distinguishing between single-switch and multi-switch faults. The proposed framework is validated on a simulated microgrid environment, illustrating robust performance in detecting and classifying both physical and cyber-related disturbances in power electronic-dominated systems.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jöbke Janssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bert Zwart, Jalal Kazempour</p>
            <p>One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</p>

            <p>This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{é}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</p>

            <p>Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan</p>
            <p>Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

            <h2>Linear Phase Balancing Scheme using Voltage Unbalance Sensitivities in Multi-phase Power Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

To address various application scenarios, we introduce optimization algorithms based on system identification (OptIden) and system simulation (OptSim) tailored to the latent variable representation. These approaches employ automatic differentiation and zeroth-order techniques, respectively, for efficient implementation. We evaluate the proposed method using a 90-zone apartment prototype, comparing its performance to traditional high-dimensional optimization.

            <p>In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and addressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For performance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are considered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each user, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna significantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna architectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based scheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based approach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal performance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna configuration.</p>

            <p>Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven operator learning for energy-efficient building control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuexin Bian, Yuanyuan Shi</p>
            <p>Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.</p>

            <h2>Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using Gaussian Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Glover, Parikshit Pareek, Deepjyoti Deka, Anamika Dubey</p>
            <p>Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.</p>

            <h2>Three-Stage Composite Outlier Identification of Wind Power Data: Integrating Physical Rules with Regression Learning and Mathematical Morphology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Limengqian Zheng, Lipeng Zhu, Weijia Wen, Jiayong Li, Cong Zhang</p>
            <p>Existing studies on identifying outliers in wind speed-power datasets are often challenged by the complicated and irregular distributions of outliers, especially those being densely stacked yet staying close to normal data. This could degrade their identification reliability and robustness in practice. To address this defect, this paper develops a three-stage composite outlier identification method by systematically integrating three complementary techniques, i.e., physical rule-based preprocessing, regression learning-enabled detection, and mathematical morphology-based refinement. Firstly, the raw wind speed-power data are preprocessed via a set of simple yet efficient physical rules to filter out some outliers obviously going against the physical operating laws of practical wind turbines. Secondly, a robust wind speed-power regression learning model is built upon the random sample consensus algorithm. This model is able to reliably detect most outliers with the help of an adaptive threshold automatically set by the interquartile range method. Thirdly, by representing the wind speed-power data distribution with a two-dimensional image, mathematical morphology operations are applied to perform refined outlier identification from a data distribution perspective. This technique can identify outliers that are not effectively detected in the first two stages, including those densely stacked ones near normal data points. By integrating the above three techniques, the whole method is capable of identifying various types of outliers in a reliable and adaptive manner. Numerical test results with wind power datasets acquired from distinct wind turbines in practice and from simulation environments extensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as well as its potential in enhancing wind power prediction.</p>

            <p>Predicting the time series of future evolutions of renewable injections and demands is of utmost importance for the operation of power systems. However, the current state of the art is mostly focused on mean-value time series predictions and only very few methods provide probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we rely on kernel density estimation and vine copulas to construct probabilistic models for individual load profiles of private households. Our approach allows the quantification of variability of individual energy consumption in general and of daily peak loads in particular. We draw upon an Australian distribution grid dataset to illustrate our findings. We generate synthetic loads that follow the distribution of the real data.</p>

            <h2>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage Considering Strategic Capacity Withholding and Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Pierre Pinson, Mads R. Almassalkhi, Yingrui Zhuang, Yifan Su, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed data-driven distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxi Tang, Li Peng</p>
            <p>What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</p>

            <h2>Safe Bottom-Up Flexibility Provision from Distributed Energy Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Costas Mylonas, Emmanouel Varvarigos, Georgios Tsaousoglou</p>
            <p>Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets, decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution network's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL typically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated into the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper ensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide distribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the aspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the decision-making loop.</p>

            <h2>A Decentralized Local Flexibility Market for Local Energy Communities to Mitigate Grid Congestion: A Case Study in Sweden</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Mohiti, Mohammadreza Mazidi, David Steen, Le Anh Tuan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a preventive congestion management framework with joint Local Flexibility Capacity Market (LFCM) and Local Energy Markets (LEMs). The framework enables Local Energy Communities (LECs) to optimize their flexibility potential across the LEM, LFCM, and heat markets. The LECs utilize their heat and electricity resources to offer flexibility services to Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for congestion relief. In this framework, energy and flexibility are treated as separate variables, each subject to different pricing scheme. Flexibility prices are market-driven, dynamically reflecting the location and severity of congestion. A case study conducted at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion by trading the LECs flexibility in the LFCM. The study also highlights up to 40% financial benefits for LECs, promoting the LFCM as a viable solution for congestion management in future decentralized energy systems.</p>

            <p>The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and EU-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. We use an optimisation model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focussing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions, and land use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in Southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall. These results on regional trade-offs facilitate more meaningful policy discussions which are crucial in the transition to a sustainable energy system.</p>

We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Fairness-aware Dynamic Hosting Capacity and the Impacts of Strategic Solar PV Curtailment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beyzanur Aydin, Rebecca Holt, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar photovoltaics (PV), poses a risk to the distribution grid under high penetration. Therefore, studying hosting capacity (HC) limits considering grid physics and demand variability is crucial. This paper introduces an improved framework for determining the HC of radial distribution networks by enhancing an existing convex inner approximation (CIA) approach. The proposed method achieves a more accurate and larger inner approximation, resulting in better HC limits. We also consider time-varying demand and the design of objective functions to ensure equitable access to grid resources. A case study with solar PV integration is conducted using a modified IEEE-37 radial network to examine the impact of increased PV capacity, demonstrating that with no more than 5% annual solar PV energy curtailed, it is possible to increase solar PV hosting capacity by at least 50% with no negative grid impacts and a net positive economic impact when accounted for the cost of carbon. Results show that fair allocation methods can lead to higher net profits and reduced PV curtailment and CO2.</p>

            <p>Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) technology has been considered a promising solution in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to its potential to overcome the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage issue and enhance coverage. Moreover, integrating IRS with a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission technique for multi-users is a smart solution to achieve a high sum rate and improve system performance. In this paper, a dynamic IRS-assisted NOMA-VLC system is modeled, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize sum energy efficiency (SEE) and fairness among multiple mobile users under power allocation and IRS mirror orientation constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the non-linearity of the constraints, conventional optimization methods are impractical for real-time solutions. Therefore, a two-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for optimizing power allocation and IRS orientation based on centralized training with decentralized execution to obtain fast and real-time solutions in dynamic environments. The results show the superior performance of the proposed DRL algorithm compared to standard DRL algorithms typically used for resource allocation in wireless communication. The results also show that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves higher performance compared to deployments without IRS and with randomly oriented IRS elements.</p>

            <p>Incorporating renewable energy sources into modern power grids has significantly decreased system inertia, which has raised concerns about power system vulnerability to disturbances and frequency instability. The conventional methods for evaluating transient stability by bounding frequency deviations are often conservative and may not accurately reflect real-world conditions and operational constraints. To address this, we propose a framework for assessing the resilience of power systems against disturbances while adhering to realistic operational frequency constraints. Our approach leverages the Lure system representation of power system dynamics and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to capture the essential frequency response requirements set by grid operators. This enables us to translate frequency constraints into formal robustness semantics. We then formulate an optimization problem to identify the maximum disturbance that the system can withstand without violating these constraints. The resulting optimization is translated into a scenario optimization while addressing the uncertainty in the obtained solution. The proposed methodology has been simulated on the Single Machine Infinite Bus case study and 9-Bus IEEE benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing resilience across various operating conditions and delivering promising results.</p>

            <p>Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum structures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to significant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we introduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler spiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes of soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural network-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model accurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and payload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed actuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low average positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator length at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively. Furthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads with an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results underscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Allocation for OFDM-based Ranging Using Random Communication Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhang, Fan Liu, Tao Liu, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>High-precision ranging plays a crucial role in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. To improve the ranging performance while maximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to reuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent randomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC system under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of both periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the ISAC signal. Towards that end, we first derive the closed-form expressions of the average squared P-ACF and A-ACF, and then propose to minimize the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under arbitrary constellation mapping. We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme achieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step further, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at every lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with frequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the ranging resolution. We reveal that there exists a tradeoff between sidelobe level and mainlobe width, and propose a project gradient descent algorithm to seek a locally optimal PA scheme that reduces the EISL. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed PA methods in reducing the ranging sidelobe level for random OFDM signals.</p>

            <p>Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction, but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT, thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The integration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum and infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The introduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities related to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant research focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security (PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages embedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious sensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance and security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique opportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential eavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS methodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC. The study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS and sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the existing literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for ISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current state of research.

In the considered system, a full-duplex enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched in the airspace, functioning as a UAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ULAP). The ULAP is capable of achieving simultaneous information transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge computing services. To reduce the overall energy consumption of the system while meeting the sensing beampattern threshold and user computation requirements, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing the task allocation, computation resource allocation, transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. Since the problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternation optimization, which decomposes the original problem into tractable convex subproblems. Moreover, we analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme saves up to 54.12\% energy consumption performance compared to the benchmark schemes.</p>

Under deterministic and stochastic profit-maximization frameworks, we analyze RCHP's multiple market participation models and derive closed-form optimal scheduling policies that dynamically allocate renewable energy to hydrogen production and electricity export to the wholesale market. Analytical characterizations of the RCHP's operating profit and the optimal sizing of renewable and electrolyzer capacities are obtained. We use real-time renewable production and electricity price data from three independent system operators to assess the impacts of hydrogen market prices, renewable generation, and electricity prices on RCHP's profitability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Schmitz, Franziska Flachsbarth, Leonie Sara Plaga, Martin Braun, Philipp Härtel</p>
            <p>Recent events, including the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and climate change impacts, have exposed the critical need to ensure energy security and resilience in energy systems. We review existing definitions and interrelations between energy security and resilience, conceptualising these terms in the context of energy system transformations. We introduce a classification of disturbances into shock events and slow burn processes to highlight key challenges to energy system resilience. Examples illustrate their distinct impacts on technical, economic, and environmental system performance over time. We compile relevant recourse options across resilience capacity levels and system planning horizons to address these challenges, emphasising actionable strategies for an increasingly integrated energy system. Finally, we propose policy recommendations to integrate shock events and slow burn processes into future energy system planning, enabling forward-looking decision-making and system design to analyse and mitigate potential disruptions.</p>

            <h2>Voltage Stability and Control of Electrical Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Power Electronic Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dionysios Moutevelis</p>
            <p>Power systems are currently undergoing a rapid paradigm change in their operation. Centralised energy production is being replaced by a number of Distributed Generation (DG) units that are placed at different locations and voltage levels in power networks. These distributed units are mostly based on renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaic cells and are commonly interfaced to the grid via power electronic converters. These sources reduce energy system dependency on conventional generation units based on fossil fuels. At the same time, this shift introduces technical challenges for the safe and reliable operation of electricity network since DG sources do not inherently provide the grid regulation services of conventional, centralised generation units. Moreover, the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and their converter-based interfaces is creating voltage deviation and voltage stability issues in distribution networks. These issues range from overvoltages during hours of peak renewable generation, reverse power flows and sudden voltage drops due to the variable nature of renewable energy production. All of the above jeopardise the reliable operation of the distribution networks that were not originally designed to accommodate for these effects. The objective of this thesis is to propose novel techniques for the accurate assessment of the DG impact on voltage stability in distribution net works and investigate how the control capabilities of converter-based interfaces of DG units can be harnessed to improve stability margins and overall system robustness and performance.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 24.14\%. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. This significantly strengthens system resilience, particularly in inertia-less power networks.</p>

            <h2>Self-Controlled Diffusion for Denoising in Scientific Imaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay Falaleev, Nikolai Orlov</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach for denoising Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) patterns using diffusion models. We propose a two-stage training process with a UNet-based architecture, incorporating an auxiliary regression head to predict the quality of the experimental pattern and assess the progress of the denoising process. The model uses an adaptive denoising strategy, which integrates quality prediction and feedback-driven iterative denoising process control. This adaptive feedback loop allows the model to adjust its schedule, providing fine control over the denoising process. Furthermore, our model can identify samples where no meaningful signal is present, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations. We demonstrate the successful application of diffusion models to EBSD pattern denoising using a custom-collected dataset of EBSD patterns, their corresponding master patterns, and quality values.</p>

            <h2>Are EVs Cleaner Than We Think? Evaluating Consequential Greenhouse Gas Emissions from EV Charging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riti Bhandarkar, Qian Luo, Emil Dimanchev, Jesse D. Jenkins</p>
            <p>While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions.</p>

            <p>The growing share of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources in power systems is increasing the need for short term operational flexibility, particularly from large industrial electricity consumers. This study proposes a practical, two stage optimization framework to unlock this flexibility in cement manufacturing and support participation in electricity balancing markets. In Stage 1, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model minimizes electricity procurement costs by optimally scheduling the raw milling subsystem. In Stage 2, a flexibility assessment model evaluates profitable deviations, targeting participation in Spain manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) market. A real world case study in a Spanish cement plant (including PV and battery storage) shows that flexibility services can yield monthly revenues of up to 800 EUR and paybacks as short as six years. This framework offers a replicable pathway for industrial flexibility in energy intensive sectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andres Intriago, Alexandros Paspatis, Francesco Liberati, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the power grid introduces new challenges, requiring detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies to analyze system interactions. Despite these needs, access to the internal firmware of power electronic devices remains restricted due to stringent nondisclosure agreements enforced by manufacturers. To address this, we explore three system identification techniques: sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA), step excitation method (SEM), and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA). SFRA employs sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies to measure the system's frequency response, while SEM and ERA utilize step functions to derive time-domain responses and transform them into Laplace-domain transfer functions. All three approaches are shown to provide consistent results in identifying the dq admittance of grid-forming inverters (GFM) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 Hz.</p>

            <h2>Towards Accurate Forecasting of Renewable Energy : Building Datasets and Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Solar and Wind Power in France</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eloi Lindas, Yannig Goude, Philippe Ciais</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiaki Kojima, Yuya Muto, Hikaru Akutsu, Rinnosuke Shima, Yoshihiko Susuki</p>
            <p>In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p>

            <h2>Neural Risk Limiting Dispatch in Power Networks: Formulation and Generalization Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ge Chen, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Risk limiting dispatch (RLD) has been proposed as an approach that effectively trades off economic costs with operational risks for power dispatch under uncertainty. However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches zero with high probability as more samples are utilized. Simulation tests across various systems demonstrate our method's superior performance in convergence, suboptimality, and computational efficiency compared with benchmarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Miretti, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Sławomir Stańczak</p>
            <p>In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and we jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur</p>
            <p>The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</p>

            <p>Due to its ability to work in non-line-of-sight and low-light environments, radio frequency (RF) imaging technology is expected to bring new possibilities for embodied intelligence and multimodal sensing. However, widely used RF devices (such as Wi-Fi) often struggle to provide high-precision electromagnetic measurements and large-scale datasets, hindering the application of RF imaging technology. In this paper, we combine the ideas of PINN to design the RINN network, using physical constraints instead of true value comparison constraints and adapting it with the characteristics of ubiquitous RF signals, allowing the RINN network to achieve RF imaging using only one sample without phase and with amplitude noise. Our numerical evaluation results show that compared with 5 classic algorithms based on phase data for imaging results, RINN's imaging results based on phaseless data are good, with indicators such as RRMSE (0.11) performing similarly well. RINN provides new possibilities for the universal development of radio frequency imaging technology.</p>

            <h2>A Quadratic Control Framework for Dynamic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ladnik</p>
            <p>This article presents a unified approach to quadratic optimal control for both linear and nonlinear discrete-time systems, with a focus on trajectory tracking. The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function that penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their desired trajectories. For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution is derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for feedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the system and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy. To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on several canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on a moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that iLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of nonlinearities. To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to constraints and system uncertainties.</p>

            <p>The rapid growth of renewable energy generation challenges the secure operation of power systems. It becomes crucial to quantify the critical security boundaries and hosting capability of renewable generation at the system operation level. This paper proposes a novel point-hyperplane geometry (PHG) method to accurately obtain the geometric expression of the operational security region of renewable energy generation for power systems. Firstly, the geometric expression of the operational security region is defined as a polytope of boundary hyperplanes in the form of inequalities satisfying the system operation constraints. Then, an orthogonal basis generation method is proposed to solve a single boundary hyperplane of the polytope based on intersecting and orthogonal geometric principles. Next, a point-hyperplane iteration algorithm is developed to progressively obtain the overall geometric polytope of the operational security region of renewable energy generation in power systems. Besides, the flexible performance trade-off can be achieved by modifying the proposed maximum tolerated angle between adjacent hyperplanes. Finally, comprehensive case studies verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PHG method.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel prognostics-driven approach to optimize operations and maintenance (O&M) decisions in hydropower systems. Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.</p>

            <p>Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.</p>

            <p>The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19-36% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples.

Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%.

            <p>The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Discrete Event Simulation Tool for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: Advancing System Efficiency and Scalability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khandaker Akramul Haque, Shining Sun, Xiang Huo, Ana E. Goulart, Katherine R. Davis</p>
            <p>Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks, necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical infrastructures. The challenge is that defense of large-scale systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE. The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000 buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

            <h2>Charging While Driving Lanes: A Boon to Electric Vehicle Owners or a Disruption to Traffic Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayan Bafandkar, Alireza Talebpour</p>
            <p>Large-scale adoption of commercial and personal Electric Vehicles (EVs) is expected to significantly affect traffic flow dynamics, emissions, and energy consumption in the transportation sector. Range anxiety and challenges associated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising solution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while driving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible to charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the traffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new congestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the effects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed harmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates (MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been investigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that introducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase congestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles aiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize traffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to increase in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses show significant reductions (up to 63\%) in pollution levels with increasing MPRs of personal and commercial EVs. Our analysis shows that while CWD lanes can facilitate the adoption of EVs, they can deteriorate traffic efficiency, emphasizing the importance of careful design and policy considerations.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing Downlink Coverage in Clustered Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miyeon Lee, Sucheol Kim, Minje Kim, Dong-Hyun Jung, Junil Choi</p>
            <p>Satellite networks are emerging as vital solutions for global connectivity beyond 5G. As companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon are poised to launch a large number of satellites in low Earth orbit, the heightened inter-satellite interference caused by mega-constellations has become a significant concern. To address this challenge, recent works have introduced the concept of satellite cluster networks where multiple satellites in a cluster collaborate to enhance the network performance. In order to investigate the performance of these networks, we propose mathematical analyses by modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes, building on the success of stochastic geometry-based analyses for satellite networks. In particular, we suggest the lower and upper bounds of the coverage probability as functions of the system parameters, including satellite density, satellite altitude, satellite cluster area, path loss exponent, and Nakagami parameter $m$. We validate the analytical expressions by comparing them with simulation results. Our analyses can be used to design reliable satellite cluster networks by effectively estimating the impact of system parameters on the coverage performance.</p>

            <h2>PV-VLM: A Multimodal Vision-Language Approach Incorporating Sky Images for Intra-Hour Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu</p>
            <p>The rapid proliferation of solar energy has significantly expedited the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into contemporary power grids. Considering that the cloud dynamics frequently induce rapid fluctuations in solar irradiance, accurate intra-hour forecasting is critical for ensuring grid stability and facilitating effective energy management. To leverage complementary temporal, textual, and visual information, this paper has proposed PV-VLM, a multimodal forecasting framework that integrates temporal, textual, and visual information by three modules. The Time-Aware Module employed a PatchTST-inspired Transformer to capture both local and global dependencies in PV power time series. Meanwhile, the Prompt-Aware Module encodes textual prompts from historical statistics and dataset descriptors via a large language model. Additionally, the Vision-Aware Module utilizes a pretrained vision-language model to extract high-level semantic features from sky images, emphasizing cloud motion and irradiance fluctuations. The proposed PV-VLM is evaluated using data from a 30-kW rooftop array at Stanford University and through a transfer study on PV systems at the University of Wollongong in Australia. Comparative experiments reveal an average RMSE reduction of approximately 5% and a MAE improvement of nearly 6%, while the transfer study shows average RMSE and MAE reductions of about 7% and 9.5%, respectively. Overall, PV-VLM leverages complementary modalities to provide a robust solution for grid scheduling and energy market participation, enhancing the stability and reliability of PV integration.</p>

            <h2>Joint Oscillation Damping and Inertia Provision Service for Converter-Interfaced Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Feng, Linbin Huang, Xiuqiang He, Yi Wang, Florian Dörfler, Chongqing Kang</p>
            <p>Power systems dominated by converter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) typically exhibit weaker damping capabilities and lower inertia, compromising system stability. Although individual DER controllers are evolving to provide superior oscillation damping capabilities and inertia supports, there is a lack of network-wide coordinated management measures for multiple DERs, potentially leading to unexpected instability and cost-effectiveness problems. To address this gap, this paper introduces a hybrid oscillation damping and inertia management strategy for multiple DERs, considering network coupling effects, and seeks to encourage DERs to provide enhanced damping and inertia with appropriate economic incentives. We first formulate an optimization problem to tune and allocate damping and inertia coefficients for DERs, minimizing associated power and energy costs while ensuring hard constraints for system frequency stability and small-signal stability. The problem is built upon a novel convex parametric formulation that integrates oscillation mode location and frequency trajectory requirements, equipped with a theoretical guarantee, and eliminating the need for iterative tuning and computation burdens. Furthermore, to increase the willingness of DERs to cooperate, we further design appropriate economic incentives to compensate for DERs' costs based on the proposed cost minimization problem, and assess its impact on system cost-efficiency. Numerical tests highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting system stability and offer insights into potential economic benefits.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Utility-Scale Solar Siting for Local Economic Benefits and Regional Decarbonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Papa Yaw Owusu-Obeng, Steven R. Miller, Sarah Banas Mills, Michael T. Craig</p>
            <p>The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to $34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by 2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by 39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5% in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.</p>

            <h2>Effect of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels on low-voltage feeders: Evidence from smart meter profiles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Becker, R. Smet, B. Macharis, K. Vanthournout</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and solar panels are low-carbon technologies (LCTs) that are being connected to the low-voltage grid (LVG) at a rapid pace. One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the distribution system operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modelled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.</p>

            <h2>Market-Driven Flexibility Provision: A Tri-Level Optimization Approach for Carbon Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijie Pan, Gerrit Rolofs, Luca Pontecorvi, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can reduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty and intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power systems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time electricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These discrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the early hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but higher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive framework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets and aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed approach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization model, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return, receive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model ensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and end-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system, supported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer behaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in guiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.</p>

            <h2>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Schaurecker, David Wozabal, Nils Löhndorf, Thorsten Staake</p>
            <p>Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</p>

            <h2>Balancing Passenger Transport and Power Distribution: A Distributed Dispatch Policy for Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jake Robbennolt, Meiyi Li, Javad Mohammadi, Stephen D. Boyles</p>
            <p>Shared autonomous electric vehicles can provide on-demand transportation for passengers while also interacting extensively with the electric distribution system. This interaction is especially beneficial after a disaster when the large battery capacity of the fleet can be used to restore critical electric loads. We develop a dispatch policy that balances the need to continue serving passengers (especially critical workers) and the ability to transfer energy across the network. The model predictive control policy tracks both passenger and energy flows and provides maximum passenger throughput if any policy can. The resulting mixed integer linear programming problem is difficult to solve for large-scale problems, so a distributed solution approach is developed to improve scalability, privacy, and resilience. We demonstrate that the proposed heuristic, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, is effective in achieving near-optimal solutions quickly. The dispatch policy is examined in simulation to demonstrate the ability of vehicles to balance these competing objectives with benefits to both systems. Finally, we compare several dispatch behaviors, demonstrating the importance of including operational constraints and objectives from both the transportation and electric systems in the model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Garret, Antoine Vacavant, Carole Frindel</p>
            <p>Deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in medical image segmentation, yet their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. In vascular applications, trustworthy segmentation should rely on both local image cues and global anatomical structures, such as vessel connectivity or branching. However, the extent to which models leverage such global context remains unclear. We present a novel explainability pipeline for 3D vessel segmentation, combining gradient-based attribution with graph-guided point selection and a blob-based analysis of Saliency maps. Using vascular graphs extracted from ground truth, we define anatomically meaningful points of interest (POIs) and assess the contribution of input voxels via Saliency maps. These are analyzed at both global and local scales using a custom blob detector. Applied to IRCAD and Bullitt datasets, our analysis shows that model decisions are dominated by highly localized attribution blobs centered near POIs. Attribution features show little correlation with vessel-level properties such as thickness, tubularity, or connectivity -- suggesting limited use of global anatomical reasoning. Our results underline the importance of structured explainability tools and highlight the current limitations of segmentation models in capturing global vascular context.</p>

Despite numerous research papers published over the last decade on various theoretical and practical aspects of this emerging topic, thorough signal modeling suitable for analysis and computer simulations is still lacking. In this article, we derive the continuous-time output voltage of a DC/DC switched-mode power electronics converter for a broad range of pulsed-based modulation schemes. We also develop corresponding discrete-time signal models and assess their accuracies. Finally, we devise a generic end-to-end signal model for arbitrary modulation signals, discuss implications of continuous-time and discrete-time signal modeling on equalization, and consider generalizations to include parasitic effects as well as the influence of general impedance loads.</p>

            <p>Power flow (PF) calculations are fundamental to power system analysis to ensure stable and reliable grid operation. The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is commonly used for PF analysis due to its rapid convergence when initialized properly. However, as power grids operate closer to their capacity limits, ill-conditioned cases and convergence issues pose significant challenges. This work, therefore, addresses these challenges by proposing strategies to improve NR initialization, hence minimizing iterations and avoiding divergence. We explore three approaches: (i) an analytical method that estimates the basin of attraction using mathematical bounds on voltages, (ii) Two data-driven models leveraging supervised learning or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict optimal initial guesses, and (iii) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that incrementally adjusts voltages to accelerate convergence. These methods are tested on benchmark systems. This research is particularly relevant for modern power systems, where high penetration of renewables and decentralized generation require robust and scalable PF solutions. In experiments, all three proposed methods demonstrate a strong ability to provide an initial guess for Newton-Raphson method to converge with fewer steps. The findings provide a pathway for more efficient real-time grid operations, which, in turn, support the transition toward smarter and more resilient electricity networks.</p>

            <p>Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are a pre-emptive strategy to mitigate the wildfires caused by power system malfunction. System operators implement PSPS to balance wildfire mitigation efforts through de-energization of transmission lines against the risk of widespread blackouts modeled with load shedding. Existing approaches do not incorporate decision-dependent wildfire-driven failure probabilities, as modeling outage scenario probabilities requires incorporating high-order polynomial terms in the objective. This paper uses distribution shaping to develop an efficient MILP problem representation of the distributionally robust PSPS problem. Building upon the author's prior work, the wildfire risk of operating a transmission line is a function of the probability of a wildfire-driven outage and its subsequent expected impact in acres burned. A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the trade-off between total cost and wildfire risk at different levels of distributional robustness, parameterized by a level of distributional dissimilarity $\kappa$. We perform simulations on the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Xiong, Heng Wu, Yifei Li, Xiongfei Wang</p>
            <p>This paper investigates power swing characteristics of grid-forming voltage source converter (GFM-VSC) systems considering the current limitation mode in both non-inertial and inertial GFM-VSC systems. Following grid faults, non-inertial GFM-VSC systems can re-synchronize with the grid but may experience significant power swings driven by its control dynamics, while inertial GFM-VSC systems may exhibit loss of synchronization (LOS), characterized by the divergence of the output angle in the active power control loop. These behaviours are different from conventional synchronous generator (SG)-based systems, where power swings are typically characterized by physical angle deviations among power sources. Based on these findings, this paper explores the performance of traditional impedance-based swing detection schemes in GFM-VSC systems. The theoretical analysis is validated through various simulations using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform, covering both single and multi-machine system scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengshuo Jia, Zeyu Cui, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Secure Estimation of Battery Voltage Under Sensor Attacks: A Self-Learning Koopman Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy</p>
            <p>Cloud-based battery management system (BMS) requires accurate terminal voltage measurement data to ensure optimal and safe charging of Lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the battery terminal voltage data as it passes from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS through the communication network, with the objective of under- or over-charging the battery. To ensure accurate terminal voltage data under such malicious sensor attacks, this paper investigates a Koopman-based secure terminal voltage estimation scheme using a two-stage error-compensated self-learning feedback. During the first stage of error correction, the potential Koopman prediction error is estimated to compensate for the error accumulation due to the linear approximation of Koopman operator. The second stage of error compensation aims to recover the error amassing from the higher-order dynamics of the Lithium-ion batteries missed by the self-learning strategy. Specifically, we have proposed two different methods for this second stage error compensation. First, an interpretable empirical correction strategy has been obtained using the open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for the battery. Second, a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method has been explored.

            <h2>Transfer Learning Assisted XgBoost For Adaptable Cyberattack Detection In Battery Packs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy</p>
            <p>Optimal charging of electric vehicle (EVs) depends heavily on reliable sensor measurements from the battery pack to the cloud-controller of the smart charging station. However, an adversary could corrupt the voltage sensor data during transmission, potentially causing local to wide-scale disruptions. Therefore, it is essential to detect sensor cyberattacks in real-time to ensure secure EV charging, and the developed algorithms must be readily adaptable to variations, including pack configurations. To tackle these challenges, we propose adaptable fine-tuning of an XgBoost-based cell-level model using limited pack-level data to use for voltage prediction and residual generation. We used battery cell and pack data from high-fidelity charging experiments in PyBaMM and `liionpack' package to train and test the detection algorithm. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated for two large-format battery packs under sensor swapping and replay attacks. The simulation results also highlight the adaptability and efficacy of our proposed detection algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Correcting Domain Shifts in Electric Motor Vibration Data for Unseen Operating Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lesley Wheat, Martin v. Mohrenschildt, Saeid Habibi, Dhafar Al-Ani</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the problem of domain shifts in electric motor vibration data created by new operating conditions in testing scenarios, focusing on bearing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The proposed method combines the Harmonic Feature Space (HFS) with regression to correct for frequency and energy differentials in steady-state data, enabling accurate FDD on unseen operating conditions within the range of the training conditions. The HFS aligns harmonics across different operating frequencies, while regression compensates for energy variations, preserving the relative magnitude of vibrations critical for fault detection. The proposed approach is evaluated on a detection problem using experimental data from a Belt-Starter Generator (BSG) electric motor, with test conditions having a minimum 1000 RPM and 5 Nm difference from training conditions. Results demonstrate that the method outperforms traditional analysis techniques, achieving high classification accuracy at a 94% detection rate and effectively reducing domain shifts. The approach is computationally efficient, requires only healthy data for training, and is well-suited for real-world applications where the exact application operating conditions cannot be predetermined.</p>

            <h2>Spectrum Sharing in STAR-RIS-assisted UAV with NOMA for Cognitive Radio Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Nazari, Ali Olfat</p>
            <p>As an emerging technology, the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks by mitigating the interference of the incident signals. The STAR-RIS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fully cover the dynamic environment through high mobility and fast deployment. According to the dynamic air-to-ground channels, the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV may face a challenge configuring their elements' coefficients (i.e., reflecting and transmitting the amplitude and phases). Hence, to meet the requirements of dynamic channel determination with the SE approach, this paper proposes the sum rate maximization of both PUs and SUs through non-orthogonal multiple access in CR network to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission-reflection beamforming design of the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV, and power allocation. Since the non-convex joint optimization problem includes coupled optimization variables, we develop an alternative optimization algorithm. Simulation results study the impact of: 1) the significant parameters, 2) the performance of different intelligence surface modes and STAR-RIS operating protocols, 3) the joint trajectory and beamforming design with fixed and mobile users, and 4) STAR-RIS capabilities such as mitigating the interference, and how variations in the roles of elements dynamically.</p>

            <h2>Balancing hydrogen delivery in national energy systems: impact of the temporal flexibility of hydrogen delivery on export prices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazem Abdel-Khalek, Eddy Jalbout, Caspar Schauß, Benjamin Pfluger</p>
            <p>Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in the energy transition. Analyses exploring the price of hydrogen usually calculate average or marginal production costs regardless of the time of delivery. A key factor that affects the price of hydrogen is the balancing costs, which we define as the expense of ensuring a steady schedule of hydrogen delivery. We explore the effect of delivering hydrogen to the export ports at different schedules, ranging from fully flexible to moderately stable with a daily and weekly buffer, to fully stable. We quantify the rise in hydrogen price with strict balancing constraint in three countries: Brazil, Morocco and Turkey, and three export volumes: 10, 50 and 200 TWh. The price difference between the flexible and stable schedules was found to reach a maximum of 36% in Brazil, 47% in Morocco and 18% in Turkey across the different export volumes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgenii Genov, Julian Ruddick, Christoph Bergmeir, Majid Vafaeipour, Thierry Coosemans, Salvador Garcia, Maarten Messagie</p>
            <p>This study investigates the integration of forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, with a focus on the role of switching costs -- penalties incurred from frequent operational adjustments. We develop a theoretical and empirical framework to examine how forecast accuracy and stability interact with switching costs in online decision-making settings. Our analysis spans both deterministic and stochastic optimization approaches, using point and probabilistic forecasts. A novel metric for measuring temporal consistency in probabilistic forecasts is introduced, and the framework is validated in a real-world battery scheduling case based on the CityLearn 2022 challenge. Results show that switching costs significantly alter the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, and that more stable forecasts can reduce the performance loss due to switching. Contrary to common practice, the findings suggest that, under non-negligible switching costs, longer commitment periods may lead to better overall outcomes. These insights have practical implications for the design of intelligent, forecast-aware energy management systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Intraday Power Trading for Single-Price Balancing Markets: An Adaptive Risk-Averse Strategy using Mixture Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Bruneel, Mathijs Schuurmans, Panagiotis Patrinos</p>
            <p>Efficient markets are characterised by profit-driven participants continuously refining their positions towards the latest insights. Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.</p>

            <h2>A Hierarchical Dataflow-Driven Heterogeneous Architecture for Wireless Baseband Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Limin Jiang, Yi Shi, Yintao Liu, Qingyu Deng, Siyi Xu, Yihao Shen, Fangfang Ye, Shan Cao, Zhiyuan Jiang</p>
            <p>Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\times$ and $2.3\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.</p>

            <p>Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world. Project website is this https URL</p>

Occhipinti</p>
            <p>At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse monitoring and assistance needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p<0.01) compared to traditional home environment. Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable framework for patient-centered, long-term care in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</p>

            <h2>Data-Importance-Aware Power Allocation for Adaptive Real-Time Communication in Computer Vision Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunmei Xu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>Life-transformative applications such as immersive extended reality are revolutionizing wireless communications and computer vision (CV). This paper presents a novel framework for importance-aware adaptive data transmissions, designed specifically for real-time CV applications where task-specific fidelity is critical. A novel importance-weighted mean square error (IMSE) metric is introduced as a task-oriented measure of reconstruction quality, considering sub-pixel-level importance (SP-I) and semantic segment-level importance (SS-I) models. To minimize IMSE under total power constraints, data-importance-aware waterfilling approaches are proposed to optimally allocate transmission power according to data importance and channel conditions, prioritizing sub-streams with high importance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform margin-adaptive waterfilling and equal power allocation strategies. The data partitioning that combines both SP-I and SS-I models is shown to achieve the most significant improvements, with normalized IMSE gains exceeding $7\,$dB and $10\,$dB over the baselines at high SNRs ($>10\,$dB). These substantial gains highlight the potential of the proposed framework to enhance data efficiency and robustness in real-time CV applications, especially in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p>The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Scrap Composition in Electric Arc and Basic Oxygen Furnaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqing Zhou, Karsten Naert, Dirk Nuyens</p>
            <p>This article aims to determine the composition of scrap (recycled material) used in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) based on the assumption of mass balance. Accurate knowledge of this composition can increase the usage of recycled material to produce steel, reducing the need for raw ore extraction and minimizing environmental impact by conserving natural resources and lowering carbon emissions. The study develops two models to describe the behavior of elements in the EAF or BOF process. A linear state space model is used for elements transferring completely from scrap to steel, while a non-linear state space model is applied to elements moving into both steel and slag. The Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter are employed to approximate these models, respectively. Importantly, the models leverage only data already collected as part of the standard production process, avoiding the need for additional measurements that are often costly. This article outlines the formulation of both models, the algorithms used, and discusses the hyperparameters involved. We provide practical suggestions on how to choose appropriate hyperparameters based on expert knowledge and historical data. The models are applied to real BOF data. Cu and Cr are chosen as examples for linear and non-linear models, respectively. The results show that both models can reconstruct the composition of scrap for these elements. The findings provide valuable insights for improving process control and ensuring product quality in steelmaking.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Popolizio, Torsten Wik, Chih Feng Lee, Changfu Zou</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.</p>

            <h2>A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela</p>
            <p>The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.</p>

We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the two methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates multi-target position estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time frequency and space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal. Closed-form expressions for the Cramér-Rao lower bound and the positioning error bound (PEB) in multi-target position estimation are derived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. To enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, a power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. The results validate the proposed PEB expression and its approximation, clearly illustrating the coordination gain enabled by ISAC. Further, the superiority of using the multi-static CF mMIMO architecture over traditional cellular ISAC is demonstrated, and the advantages of OTFS signals in high-mobility scenarios are highlighted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</p>

            <p>Channel models that represent various operating conditions a communication system might experience are important for design and standardization of any communication system. While statistical channel models have long dominated this space, machine learning (ML) is becoming a popular alternative approach. However, existing approaches have mostly focused on predictive solutions to match instantaneous channel realizations. Other solutions have focused on pathloss modeling, while double-directional (DD) channel representation is needed for a complete description. Motivated by this, we (a) develop a generative solution that uses a hybrid Transformer (hTransformer) model with a low-rank projected attention calculation mechanism and a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer to generate complete DD channel information and (b) design a domain-knowledge-informed training method to match the generated and true channel realizations' statistics.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayashree Yadav, Ingemar Mathiasson, Bindu Panikkar, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>The transition to low-carbon energy systems demands comprehensive evaluation tools that account for technical, economic, environmental, and social dimensions. While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy transition, few provide an integrated framework that captures the full spectrum of impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive techno-economic, environmental, and social (TEES) assessment framework to evaluate energy transition pathways. The framework provides a structured methodology for assessing infrastructure needs, cost implications, emissions reductions, and social equity impacts, offering a systematic approach for informed decision-making. To illustrate its applicability, a detailed case study of a remote community in Alaska is conducted, evaluating the TEES impacts of three distinct energy transition pathways including heat pumps (HPs) and battery integration, resource coordination and expanded community solar photovoltaic (PV). Findings show that coordination of HPs minimizes peak demand, enhances grid reliability, and reduces energy burdens among low-income households. Extensive simulation-based analysis reveals that strategically staging electric HPs with existing oil heating systems can lower overall energy costs by 19% and reduce emissions by 29% compared to the today's system and outperforms all-heat-pump strategy for economic savings. By combining a generalizable, community-centric assessment framework with data-driven case study insights, this work offers a practical tool for utilities, community stakeholders and policymakers to work toward equitable and sustainable energy transitions.</p>

            <p>Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.</p>

While ZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its constant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and destabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous voltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and topology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To address these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system comprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected according to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a local controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary topology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked ``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs. Subsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust (dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the dissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and globally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and embed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI problems, thus providing a one-shot approach (as opposed to iterative schemes) to solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper provides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches.</p>

            <h2>UAV-Assisted MEC for Disaster Response: Stackelberg Game-Based Resource Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yafei Guo, Ziye Jia, Lei Zhang, Jia He, Yu Zhang, Qihui Wu</p>
            <p>The unmanned aerial vehicle assisted multi-access edge computing (UAV-MEC) technology has been widely applied in the sixth-generation era. However, due to the limitations of energy and computing resources in disaster areas, how to efficiently offload the tasks of damaged user equipments (UEs) to UAVs is a key issue. In this work, we consider a multiple UAVMECs assisted task offloading scenario, which is deployed inside the three-dimensional corridors and provide computation services for UEs. In detail, a ground UAV controller acts as the central decision-making unit for deploying the UAV-MECs and allocates the computational resources. Then, we model the relationship between the UAV controller and UEs based on the Stackelberg game. The problem is formulated to maximize the utility of both the UAV controller and UEs. To tackle the problem, we design a K-means based UAV localization and availability response mechanism to pre-deploy the UAV-MECs. Then, a chess-like particle swarm optimization probability based strategy selection learning optimization algorithm is proposed to deal with the resource allocation. Finally, extensive simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the utility of the UAV controller and UEs in various scenarios compared with baseline schemes.</p>

            <h2>Can Carbon-Aware Electric Load Shifting Reduce Emissions? An Equilibrium-Based Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Olivier Huber, Michael C. Ferris, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing number of electric loads, such as hydrogen producers or data centers, can be characterized as carbon-sensitive, meaning that they are willing to adapt the timing and/or location of their electricity usage in order to minimize carbon footprints. However, the emission reduction efforts of these carbon-sensitive loads rely on carbon intensity information such as average carbon emissions, and it is unclear whether load shifting based on these signals effectively reduces carbon emissions. To address this open question, we investigate the impact of carbon-sensitive consumers using equilibrium analysis. Specifically, we expand the commonly used equilibrium model for electricity market clearing to include carbon-sensitive consumers that adapt their consumption based on an average carbon intensity signal. This analysis represents an idealized situation for carbon-sensitive loads, where their carbon preferences are reflected directly in the market clearing, and contrasts with current practice where carbon intensity signals only become known to consumers aposteriori (i.e. after the market has already been cleared). We include both illustrative examples and larger numerical simulations, including benchmarking with other methods, to illuminate the contributions and limitations of carbon-sensitive loads in power system emission reductions.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Augmented Complex Maximum Total Correntropy Algorithm for Power System Frequency Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiquan Zhao, Yi Peng, Jinsong Chen, Jinhui Hu</p>
            <p>Currently, adaptive filtering algorithms have been widely applied in frequency estimation for power systems. However, research on diffusion tasks remains insufficient. Existing diffusion adaptive frequency estimation algorithms exhibit certain limitations in handling input noise and lack robustness against impulsive noise. Moreover, traditional adaptive filtering algorithms designed based on the strictly-linear (SL) model fail to effectively address frequency estimation challenges in unbalanced three-phase power systems. To address these issues, this letter proposes an improved diffusion augmented complex maximum total correntropy (DAMTCC) algorithm based on the widely linear (WL) model. The proposed algorithm not only significantly enhances the capability to handle input noise but also demonstrates superior robustness to impulsive noise. Furthermore, it successfully resolves the critical challenge of frequency estimation in unbalanced three-phase power systems, offering an efficient and reliable solution for diffusion power system frequency estimation. Finally, we analyze the stability of the algorithm and computer simulations verify the excellent performance of the algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wasseem Al-Rousan, Caisheng Wang, Feng Lin</p>
            <p>Cascading failures in power systems caused by sequential tripping of components are a serious concern as they can lead to complete or partial shutdowns, disrupting vital services and causing damage and inconvenience. In prior work, we developed a new approach for identifying and preventing cascading failures in power systems. The approach uses supervisory control technique of discrete event systems (DES) by incorporating both on-line lookahead control and forcible events. In this paper, we use modular supervisory control of DES to reduce computation complexity and increase the robustness and reliability of control. Modular supervisory control allows us to predict and mitigate cascading failures in power systems more effectively. We implemented the proposed control technique on a simulation platform developed in MATLAB and applied the proposed DES controller. The calculations of modular supervisory control of DES are performed using an external tool and imported into the MATLAB platform. We conduct simulation studies for the IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus and 300-bus systems, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Frequency Support from Virtual Power Plants: Minimal Reserve and Allocation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhu, Guangchun Ruan, Hua Geng</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel reserve-minimizing and allocation strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) to deliver optimal frequency support. The proposed strategy enables VPPs, acting as aggregators for inverter-based resources (IBRs), to provide optimal frequency support economically. The proposed strategy captures time-varying active power injections, reducing the unnecessary redundancy compared to traditional fixed reserve schemes. Reserve requirements for the VPPs are determined based on system frequency response and safety constraints, ensuring efficient grid support. Furthermore, an energy-based allocation model decomposes power injections for each IBR, accounting for their specific limitations. Numerical experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting significant financial gains for VPPs, especially as system inertia decreases due to higher renewable energy integration.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Passivity Sensitivity Methodology for Small-Signal Stability Analysis</h2>

            <p>This paper proposes a generalized passivity sensitivity analysis for power system stability studies. The method uncovers the most effective instability mitigation actions for both device-level and system-level investigations. The particular structure of the admittance and nodal models is exploited in the detailed derivation of the passivity sensitivity expressions. These proposed sensitivities are validated for different parameters at device-level and at system-level. Compared to previous stability and sensitivity methods, it does not require detailed system information, such as exact system eigenvalues, while it provides valuable information for a less conservative stable system design. In addition, we demonstrate how to utilize the proposed method through case studies with different converter controls and system-wide insights showing its general applicability.</p>

            <p>With the development of artificial intelligence integrated next-generation communication networks, mobile users (MUs) are increasingly demanding the efficient processing of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs. Fortunately, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) supported mobile edge computing (MEC) is regarded as an effective solution, offering the MUs multi-tier and efficient computing services. In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.</p>

            <p>We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Cheng, Yize Chen</p>
            <p>In the power and energy industry, multiple entities in grid operational logs are frequently recorded and updated. Thanks to recent advances in IT facilities and smart metering services, a variety of datasets such as system load, generation mix, and grid connection are often publicly available. While these resources are valuable in evaluating power grid's operational conditions and system resilience, the lack of fine-grained, accurate locational information constrain the usage of current data, which further hinders the development of smart grid and renewables integration. For instance, electricity end users are not aware of nodal generation mix or carbon emissions, while the general public have limited understanding about the effect of demand response or renewables integration if only the whole system's demands and generations are available. In this work, we focus on recovering power grid topology and line flow directions from open public dataset. Taking the Alberta grid as a working example, we start from mapping multi-modal power system datasets to the grid topology integrated with geographical information. By designing a novel optimization-based scheme to recover line flow directions, we are able to analyze and visualize the interactions between generations and demand vectors in an efficient manner. Proposed research is fully open-sourced and highly generalizable, which can help model and visualize grid information, create synthetic dataset, and facilitate analytics and decision-making framework for clean energy transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Mohammadian, Anna Van Boven, Kyri Baker</p>
            <p>Electric power grids are essential components of modern life, delivering reliable power to end-users while adhering to a multitude of engineering constraints and requirements. In grid operations, the Optimal Power Flow problem plays a key role in determining cost-effective generator dispatch that satisfies load demands and operational limits. However, due to stressed operating conditions, volatile demand profiles, and increased generation from intermittent energy sources, this optimization problem may become infeasible, posing risks such as voltage instability and line overloads. This study proposes a learning framework that combines machine learning with counterfactual explanations to automatically diagnose and restore feasibility in the OPF problem. Our method provides transparent and actionable insights by methodically identifying infeasible conditions and suggesting minimal demand response actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on IEEE 30-bus and 300-bus systems, demonstrating its capability to recover feasibility with high success rates and generating diverse corrective options, appropriate for real-time decision-making. These preliminary findings illustrate the potential of combining classical optimization with explainable AI techniques to enhance grid reliability and resilience.</p>

            <p>To transition towards a carbon-neutral power system, considerable amounts of renewable energy generation capacity are being installed in the North Sea area. Consequently, projects aggregating many gigawatts of power generation capacity and transmitting renewable energy to the main load centers are being developed. Given the electrical challenges arising from having bulk power capacity in a compact geographical area with several connections to the main grid, and a lack of a robust definition identifying the type of system under study, this paper proposes a general technical definition of such projects introducing the term Electrical Energy Hub (EEH). The concept, purpose, and functionalities of EEHs are introduced in the text, emphasizing the importance of a clear technical definition for future planning procedures, grid codes, regulations, and support schemes for EEHs and multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) grids in general. Furthermore, the unique electrical challenges associated with integrating EEHs into the power system are discussed. Three research areas of concern are identified, namely control, planning, and protection. Through this analysis, insights are provided into the effective implementation of multi-GW scale EEH projects and their integration into the power grid through multiple interconnections. Finally, a list of ongoing and planned grid development projects is evaluated to assess whether they fall within the EEH category</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samantha Israel, Sanjana Kunkolienkar, Ana Goulart, Kate Davis, Thomas Overbye</p>
            <p>Power grids and their cyber infrastructure are classified as Critical Energy Infrastructure/Information (CEII) and are not publicly accessible. While realistic synthetic test cases for power systems have been developed in recent years, they often lack corresponding cyber network models. This work extends synthetic grid models by incorporating cyber-physical representations. To address the growing need for realistic and scalable models that integrate both cyber and physical layers in electric power systems, this paper presents the Scalable Automatic Model Generation Tool (SAM-GT). This tool enables the creation of large-scale cyber-physical topologies for power system models. The resulting cyber-physical network models include power system switches, routers, and firewalls while accounting for data flows and industrial communication protocols. Case studies demonstrate the tool's application to synthetic grid models of 500, 2,000, and 10,000 buses, considering three distinct network topologies. Results from these case studies include network metrics on critical nodes, hops, and generation times, showcasing effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability of SAM-GT.</p>

The network consists of diverse sets of generation resources (including solar panels, fuel cells, natural gas generators, and utility interconnections), loads (including large-scale electric vehicle charging, data centers, central cooling, offices), topology changes (such as line outages and load transfers), as well as a mixture of single- and three-phase networks. We describe a densely deployed PMU sensor network in a distribution grid, in which all buses with non-zero power injections are measured. This approach enables a range of applications such as state estimation, system identification, power flow optimization, and feedback control, several of which are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we provide a synchronized waveform dataset which allows the analysis of harmonics, transient events, dynamic grid impedance, and stability. Data collection started in 2023 while new data is generated continuously and made available online. A characterization of measurement error is provided.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Zapparoli, Blazhe Gjorgiev, Giovanni Sansavini</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into power systems presents opportunities and challenges for ancillary services (AS) provision. Technical requirements of existing AS (i.e., duration, reliability, ramp rate, and lead time) have been designed for traditional generating units, making their provision by DER aggregates particularly challenging. This paper proposes a method to design the duration of reserve capacity AS products considering the operational constraints of DERs and the temporal dynamics of system imbalances. The optimal product duration is determined by maximizing product availability and aligning the supply profile with the system's balancing needs. We apply the methodology to a realistic Swiss low-voltage network with a diverse DER portfolio. The results reveal that (i) shorter product durations maximize average availability and (ii) long product durations improve the alignment with system balancing needs. This paper offers valuable insights for system operators to design AS products tailored for DER participation.</p>

            <p>Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can also raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure. This can increase the risk of blackouts or require grid reinforcement that is often slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to five times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles is estimated to require 600 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of \$350 to \$790 billion, or \$2,800 to \$6,400 per household (95% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management could eliminate three-quarters of grid reinforcement costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaesang Park, Alireza Askarian, Srinivasa Salapaka</p>
            <p>As inverter-based loads and energy sources become increasingly prevalent, accurate estimation of line impedance between inverters and the grid is essential for optimizing performance and enhancing control strategies. This paper presents a non-invasive method for estimating output-line impedance using measurements local to the inverter. It provides a specific method for signal conditioning of signals measured at the inverter, which makes the measured data better suited to estimation algorithms. An algorithm based on the Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive Least Squares (VDF-RLS) method is introduced, which leverages these conditioned signals for precise impedance estimation. The signal conditioning process transforms measurements into the direct-quadrature (dq) coordinate frame, where the rotating frame frequency is determined to facilitate a simpler and more accurate estimation. This frequency is implemented using a secondary Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to attenuate grid voltage measurement variations. By isolating the variation-sensitive q-axis and relying solely on the less sensitive d-axis, the method further minimizes the impact of variations. The VDF-RLS estimation method achieves rapid adaptation while ensuring stability in the absence of persistent excitation by selectively discarding outdated data during updates. Proposed conditioning and estimation methods are non-invasive; estimations are solely done using measured outputs, and no signal is injected into the power network. Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in impedance estimation stability, particularly in low-excitation conditions, where the VDF-RLS method achieves more than three time lower error compared to existing approaches such as constant forgetting RLS and the Kalman filter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, needs to be adequately distributed in water distribution networks (WDNs) to maintain consistent residual levels and ensure water safety. This is performed through control node injections at the treatment plant via booster stations scattered in WDNs. While previous studies have applied various optimization metrics for booster station placement, many have failed to consider the coverage of the station injections and the dynamic nature of WDNs. In particular, variations in hydraulics and demand significantly impact the reachability and efficacy of chlorine injections which then impact optimal placement of booster stations. This study introduces a novel formulation that combines control- and graph-theoretic approaches to solve the booster station placement problem. Unlike traditional methods, our approach emphasizes maximizing the system's ability to control disinfectant levels with minimal energy, taking into account the time-varying hydraulic profiles that lead to different optimal station placements. We propose a simple weighting technique to determine the placements by assessing the structural controllability of each configuration, based on the network's topology and independent of specific parameters like decay rates or pipe roughness. This method ensures effective chlorine coverage across the network. Our approach is validated on different networks, demonstrating its operational effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.</p>

            <p>Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion.

This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Jiang, Xuezheng Wang, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) provides a promising solution for building energy modeling and can serve as a virtual environment to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact and learn. However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called "temperature response violation" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Almomani, Muhammad Sarwar, Venkataramana Ajjarapu</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel Short-Term Voltage Stability Index (STVSI), which leverages Lyapunov Exponent-based detection to assess and quantify short-term stability triggered by Over Excitation Limiters (OELs) or undamped oscillations in voltage. The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Entropy-Based Metric for Characterization of Delayed Voltage Recovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Almomani, Muhammad Sarwar, Venkataramana Ajjarapu</p>
            <p>Ensuring accurate violation detection in power systems is paramount for operational reliability. This paper introduces an enhanced voltage recovery violation index (EVRVI), a comprehensive index designed to quantify fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR). EVRVI enhances traditional entropy-based methods by leveraging Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to extract key features from the voltage signal, which are then used to quantify over-voltage (OV) and under-voltage (UV) events. Our simulations on the Nordic system, involving over 245k scenarios, demonstrate EVRVI's superior ability to identify and categorize voltage recovery issues compared to the traditional entropy-based measure. EVRVI not only significantly reduces false negatives in violation detection but also provides a reliable framework for over-voltage detection, making it an invaluable tool for modern power system studies.</p>

            <h2>Impact Assessment of Cyberattacks in Inverter-Based Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kerd Topallaj, Colin McKerrell, Suraj Ramanathan, Ioannis Zografopoulos</p>
            <p>In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetrations through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.</p>

            <p>Hybrid wind-wave energy system, integrating floating offshore wind turbine and wave energy converters, has received much attention in recent years due to its potential benefit in increasing the power harvest density and reducing the levelized cost of electricity. Apart from the design complexities of the hybrid wind-wave energy systems, their energy conversion efficiency, power output smoothness and their safe operations introduce new challenges for their control system designs. Recent studies show that advanced model-based control strategies have the great potential to significantly improve their overall control performance. However the performance of these advanced control strategies rely on the computationally efficient control-oriented models with sufficient fidelity, which are normally difficult to derive due to the complexity of the hydro-, aero-dynamic effects and the this http URL most available results, the hybrid wind-wave energy system models are established by using the Boundary Element Method, devoting to understanding the hydrodynamic responses and performance analysis. However, such models are complex and involved relatively heavy computational burden, which cannot be directly used for the advanced model-based control methods that are essential for improving power capture efficiency from implementing in practice.

            <h2>Plug and Play Distributed Control of Clustered Energy Hub Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varsha Behrunani, Cara Koepele, Jared Miller, Ahmed Aboudonia, Philipp Heer, Roy S. Smith, John Lygeros</p>
            <p>The transition to renewable energy is driving the rise of distributed multi-energy systems, in which individual energy hubs and prosumers (e.g., homes, industrial campuses) generate, store, and trade energy. Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of energy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while ensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases computational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales. Additionally, current distributed control techniques require global recomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework that enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join or leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is restricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem is formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading commitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and cost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both levels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational feasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play procedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster levels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and enables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiran Zhao, Ruohan Leng, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Keyou You, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Power electronic converters are becoming the main components of modern power systems due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources. However, power converters may become unstable when interacting with the complex and time-varying power grid. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data-driven control method to stabilize power converters by using only online input-output data. Our contributions are threefold. First, we reformulate the output-feedback control problem as a state-feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with a controllable non-minimal state, which can be constructed from past input-output signals. Second, we propose a data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method for this non-minimal realization to achieve efficient output-feedback adaptive control. Third, we use high-fidelity simulations to verify that the output-feedback DeePO can effectively stabilize grid-connected power converters and quickly adapt to the changes in the power grid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.</p>

            <p>This paper presents Large Wireless Model (LWM) -- the world's first foundation model for wireless channels. Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems.

Crucially, our model maintains explainability through SHapley Additive exPlanations value analysis, revealing that fine particle content and dry density are the most influential parameters affecting soil resistivity. We developes a web-based application implementing this model to provide engineers with an accessible decision support framework that bridges geotechnical and electrical engineering requirements for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Shitu Zhang, Yuanzheng Li</p>
            <p>In the era of Industry 4.0, ensuring the resilience of cyber-physical systems against sophisticated cyber threats is increasingly critical. This study proposes a pioneering AI-based control framework that enhances short-term voltage stability assessments (STVSA) in power systems under complex composite cyber-attacks. First, by incorporating white-box and black-box adversarial attacks with Denial-of-Service (DoS) perturbations during training, composite adversarial attacks are implemented. Second, the application of Spectral Normalized Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (SNCWGAN-GP) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) strengthens the model's resistance to adversarial disturbances, improving data quality and training stability. Third, an assessment model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-enhanced Graph Attention Network (L-GAT) is developed to capture dynamic relationships between the post-fault dynamic trajectories and electrical grid topology. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method in composite cyber-attack scenarios. This contribution is pivotal to advancing AI-based resilient control strategies for nonlinear dynamical systems, marking a substantial enhancement in the security of cyber-physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Moving Target Defense Against Adversarial False Data Injection Attacks In Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yexiang Chen, Subhash Lakshminarayana, H. Vincent Poor</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML)-based detectors have been shown to be effective in detecting stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that can bypass conventional bad data detectors (BDDs) in power systems. However, ML models are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A sophisticated perturbation signal added to the original BDD-bypassing FDIA can conceal the attack from ML-based detectors. In this paper, we develop a moving target defense (MTD) strategy to defend against adversarial FDIAs in power grids. We first develop an MTD-strengthened deep neural network (DNN) model, which deploys a pool of DNN models rather than a single static model that cooperate to detect the adversarial attack jointly. The MTD model pool introduces randomness to the ML model's decision boundary, thereby making the adversarial attacks detectable. Furthermore, to increase the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and reduce the computational costs associated with developing the MTD model pool, we combine this approach with the physics-based MTD, which involves dynamically perturbing the transmission line reactance and retraining the DNN-based detector to adapt to the new system topology. Simulations conducted on IEEE test bus systems demonstrate that the MTD-strengthened DNN achieves up to 94.2% accuracy in detecting adversarial FDIAs. When combined with a physics-based MTD, the detection accuracy surpasses 99%, while significantly reducing the computational costs of updating the DNN models. This approach requires only moderate perturbations to transmission line reactances, resulting in minimal increases in OPF cost.</p>

            <h2>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries For Fast Frequency Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutong He, Guangchun Ruan, Haiwang Zhong</p>
            <p>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%-57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</p>

            <p>The growing scale of power systems and the increasing uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources necessitates novel optimization techniques that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem.

            <p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources has sparked interests in participating in power markets. Here, we consider two settings where Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) with some flexible resources participate in the electricity trading, either directly in the wholesale electricity market, or interfaced by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) who is the transaction organizer. In order to study the role of DSO as a stakeholder, a Stackelberg game is represented via a bi-level model: the DSO maximizes profits at the upper level, while the VPPs minimize operating costs at the lower level. To solve this problem, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of lower level is deduced to achieve a single-level problem. The results show that the role of the DSO as an intermediary agent leads to a decrease in operating costs of the VPPs by organizing lower-level trading, while making a profit for itself. However, this seemingly win-win result comes at the cost of losing wholesale market interests, which implies that stakeholders need to abide by regulatory constraints in the electricity market.</p>

            <p>Fast and accurate waveform simulation is critical for understanding fiber channel characteristics, developing digital signal processing (DSP) technologies, optimizing optical network configurations, and advancing the optical fiber transmission system towards wideband. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for waveform modeling, offering high accuracy and low complexity compared to traditional split-step Fourier method (SSFM), due to its strong nonlinear fitting capabilities and efficient parallel computation. However, most DL methods are designed for few-channel and low-rate WDM systems, leaving their scalability to wideband systems uncertain. Moreover, the lack of a standardized accuracy evaluation method and the inconsistent results between waveform errors and transmission performance errors, hinders fair comparisons of various DL schemes. In this paper, we introduce a DSP-assisted accuracy evaluation method integrated with nonlinear DSP, providing a fair benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of DL models. Using this method, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DL schemes, ranging from simple configurations to more complex wideband setups. The feature decoupled distributed method combining with bidirectional long short-term memory achieves the better performance compared to other DL schemes. Furthermore, in scenarios with more-channel and higher-rate, the performance advantages of FDD-BiLSTM will be further improved. However, as the number of channels and symbol rates increase, the performance of FDD-BiLSTM still gradually deteriorate. We analyze these challenges from three perspectives: the more intricate linear and nonlinear effects, the higher sampling rate required for SSFM. To address these challenges, we discuss potential solutions from two aspects: incorporating more prior physical knowledge and optimizing the structure of DL models.</p>

            <p>Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for optimal patient management. Differentiating between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study develops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed to classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right heart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test set (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training set. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process multimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH) sequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard deviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The discriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11), pre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +- 0.10).

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tannan Xiao, Ying Chen, Han Diao, Shaowei Huang, Chen Shen</p>
            <p>Power system optimal dispatch with transient security constraints is commonly represented as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based TSC-OPF trains efficient decision-making agents that are adaptable to various scenarios and provide solution results quickly. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state space and action spaces, as well as the non-smoothness of dynamic constraints, existing DRL-based TSC-OPF solution methods face a significant challenge of the sparse reward problem. To address this issue, a fast-converged DRL method for TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling of TSC-OPF is improved by reducing the observation space and smoothing the reward design, thus facilitating agent training. An improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Curriculum learning, Parallel exploration, and Ensemble decision-making (DDPG-CPEn) is introduced to drastically enhance the efficiency of agent training and the accuracy of decision-making. The effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through experiments in the IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid. The source code of the proposed method is made public on GitHub.</p>

            <h2>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Maleki, E. Veronica Belmaga, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana</p>
            <p>The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-level Dynamics and System-Level Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehao Zhuang, Huanhai Xin, Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Grid-Forming (GFM) technology is considered a promising solution to build power electronics-dominated power systems. However, the impact of GFM converters on the system stability is still unquantified, creating a gap between the system- and device-level perspectives. To fill this gap, at the device-level, we propose a Forming Index to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage variations, providing a characterization of its GFM behavior. At the system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to capture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we establish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by demonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.</p>

            <h2>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madeleine Pollack, Ryan Piansky, Swati Gupta, Daniel Molzahn</p>
            <p>Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven Power Loss Identification through Physics-Based Thermal Model Backpropagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mattia Scarpa, Francesco Pase, Ruggero Carli, Mattia Bruschetta, Franscesco Toso</p>
            <p>Digital twins for power electronics require accurate power losses whose direct measurements are often impractical or impossible in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-based thermal modeling with data-driven techniques to identify and correct power losses accurately using only temperature measurements. Our approach leverages a cascaded architecture where a neural network learns to correct the outputs of a nominal power loss model by backpropagating through a reduced-order thermal model. We explore two neural architectures, a bootstrapped feedforward network, and a recurrent neural network, demonstrating that the bootstrapped feedforward approach achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. Between the interconnection, we included normalization strategies and physics-guided training loss functions to preserve stability and ensure physical consistency. Experimental results show that our hybrid model reduces both temperature estimation errors (from 7.2+-6.8°C to 0.3+-0.3°C) and power loss prediction errors (from 5.4+-6.6W to 0.2+-0.3W) compared to traditional physics-based approaches, even in the presence of thermal model uncertainties. This methodology allows us to accurately estimate power losses without direct measurements, making it particularly helpful for real-time industrial applications where sensor placement is hindered by cost and physical limitations.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Microreactor Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Tunkle, Kamal Abdulraheem, Linyu Lin, Majdi I. Radaideh</p>
            <p>The economic feasibility of nuclear microreactors will depend on minimizing operating costs through advancements in autonomous control, especially when these microreactors are operating alongside other types of energy systems (e.g., renewable energy). This study explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors, exploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a point kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a baseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that RL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks, can achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional PID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients, the RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID. Over extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback becomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still remained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration scenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to longer, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training costs and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to multiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained reactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective that standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as increasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the RL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so with less control effort.</p>

            <h2>Methodology for Detecting Energy Anomalies due to Multi-Replay Attacks on Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Babu Mitikiri, Vedantham Lakshmi Srinivas, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>The increasing deployment of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs) introduces cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to inherent vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to cyberattacks. The vulnerable points in EVCI are charging ports, which serve as the links between the EVs and the EVCI as they transfer the data along with the power. Data spoofing attacks targeting these ports can compromise security, reliability, and overall system performance by introducing anomalies in operational data. An efficient method for identifying the charging port current magnitude variations is presented in this research. The MATLAB/SIMULINK environment simulates an EVCI system for various data generating scenarios. A Temporal Convolution Network - Autoencoder (TCN-AE) model is used in training the multivariate time series data of EVCI and reconstructing it. The abnormalities in data are that various charging port current magnitudes are replaced with their respective data of different durations, thus enabling the replay attack scenarios. To detect anomalies, the error between the original and reconstructed data is computed, and these error values are used for detecting the anomalies. With the help of the mean vector and covariance matrices of the errors, the anomaly score is computed in the form of Mahalanobis distance. The threshold is obtained from the short sub-sequence of the errors and optimized for the whole time series data. The obtained optimal threshold is compared with the anomaly score to detect the anomaly. The model demonstrates robust performance in data reconstruction by identifying anomalies with an accuracy of 99.64%, to enhance the reliability and security in operations of EVCI.</p>

            <h2>Aggregate Flexibility of Thermostatically Controlled Loads using Generalized Polymatroids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Mukhi, Alessandro Abate</p>
            <p>Leveraging populations of thermostatically controlled loads could provide vast storage capacity to the grid. To realize this potential, their flexibility must be accurately aggregated and represented to the system operator as a single, controllable virtual device. Mathematically this is computed by calculating the Minkowski sum of the individual flexibility of each of the devices. Previous work showed how to exactly characterize the flexibility of lossless storage devices as generalized polymatroids-a family of polytope that enable an efficient computation of the Minkowski sum. In this paper we build on these results to encompass devices with dissipative storage dynamics. In doing so we are able to provide tractable methods of accurately characterizing the flexibility in populations consisting of a variety of heterogeneous devices. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed characterizations are tight.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Pricing for Optimal Coordination in Networked Energy Systems with Nonsmooth Cost Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayi Li, Jiale Wei, Matthew Motoki, Yan Jiang, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>Incentive-based coordination mechanisms for distributed energy consumption have shown promise in aligning individual user objectives with social welfare, especially under privacy constraints. Our prior work proposed a two-timescale adaptive pricing framework, where users respond to prices by minimizing their local cost, and the system operator iteratively updates the prices based on aggregate user responses. A key assumption was that the system cost need to smoothly depend on the aggregate of the user demands. In this paper, we relax this assumption by considering the more realistic model of where the cost are determined by solving a DCOPF problem with constraints. We present a generalization of the pricing update rule that leverages the generalized gradients of the system cost function, which may be nonsmooth due to the structure of DCOPF. We prove that the resulting dynamic system converges to a unique equilibrium, which solves the social welfare optimization problem. Our theoretical results provide guarantees on convergence and stability using tools from nonsmooth analysis and Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations on networked energy systems illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <h2>Robust Continuous-Time Generation Scheduling under Power Demand Uncertainty: An Affine Decision Rule Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngchae Cho, Insoon Yang, Takayuki Ishizaki</p>
            <p>Most existing generation scheduling models for power systems under demand uncertainty rely on energy-based formulations with a finite number of time periods, which may fail to ensure that power supply and demand are balanced continuously over time. To address this issue, we propose a robust generation scheduling model in a continuous-time framework, employing a decision rule approach. First, for a given set of demand trajectories, we formulate a general robust generation scheduling problem to determine a decision rule that maps these demand trajectories and time points to the power outputs of generators. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate of it as our model by carefully designing a class of decision rules that are affine in the current demand, with coefficients invariant over time and constant terms that are continuous piecewise affine functions of time. As a result, our model can be recast as a finite-dimensional linear program to determine the coefficients and the function values of the constant terms at each breakpoint, solvable via the cutting-plane method. Our model is non-anticipative unlike most existing continuous-time models, which use Bernstein polynomials, making it more practical. We also provide illustrative numerical examples.</p>

            <h2>Battery Operations in Electricity Markets: Strategic Behavior and Distortions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Anunrojwong, Santiago R. Balseiro, Omar Besbes, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out variations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow from their role as marginal "price-takers" to significant players in the market, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity markets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort decisions compared to centralized batteries? We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of the highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting battery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no battery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing battery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge decisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e., discharging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in participation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its discharge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time responsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand than centrally optimal. We also quantify the impact of the battery market power on total system cost via the Price of Anarchy metric, and prove that the it is always between $9/8$ and $4/3$. That is, incentive misalignment always exists, but it is bounded even in the worst case. We calibrate our model to real data from Los Angeles and Houston. Lastly, we show that competition is very effective at reducing distortions, but many market power mitigation mechanisms backfire, and lead to higher total cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinming Chen, Jingyi Fang, Yuanzhong Zheng, Yaoxuan Wang, Haojun Fei</p>
            <p>Emotion recognition plays a pivotal role in intelligent human-machine interaction systems. Multimodal approaches benefit from the fusion of diverse modalities, thereby improving the recognition accuracy. However, the lack of high-quality multimodal data and the challenge of achieving optimal alignment between different modalities significantly limit the potential for improvement in multimodal approaches. In this paper, the proposed Qieemo framework effectively utilizes the pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model backbone which contains naturally frame aligned textual and emotional features, to achieve precise emotion classification solely based on the audio modality. Furthermore, we design the multimodal fusion (MMF) module and cross-modal attention (CMA) module in order to fuse the phonetic posteriorgram (PPG) and emotional features extracted by the ASR encoder for improving recognition accuracy. The experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that Qieemo outperforms the benchmark unimodal, multimodal, and self-supervised models with absolute improvements of 3.0%, 1.2%, and 1.9% respectively.</p>

By addressing speed and current oscillations directly during the startup and transition stages, the approach significantly enhances overall system stability and responsiveness. Validation through simulation and experimental testing demonstrates the strategy's success in maintaining low oscillation levels across various operating conditions, confirming its reliability for high-performance industrial applications.</p>

            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varsha N. Behrunani, Philipp Heer, Roy S. Smith, John Lygeros</p>
            <p>Peer-to-peer(P2P) energy trading may increase efficiency and reduce costs, but introduces significant challenges for network operators such as maintaining grid reliability, accounting for network losses, and redistributing costs equitably. We propose a novel loss-aware pricing strategy for P2P energy markets that addresses these challenges while incentivizing participation in the cooperative energy trading market. The problem is formulated as a hierarchical Stackelberg game, where a grid operator determines network tariffs while prosumers optimize their trades based on these tariffs while guaranteeing that network constraints are satisfied. The algorithm is designed to minimize and recover their cost from the trading parties, while also minimizing the total cost of the hubs. The mechanism dynamically adjusts tariffs based on location and network topology, discouraging loss-intensive trades. Finally, the complete framework includes the computation of fair trading prices, ensuring all market participants benefit equitably. An ADMM-based hyper-gradient descent method is proposed for solving this problem. Extensive numerical simulations using the benchmark IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate significant cost reductions and improved network efficiency through reduction in network losses compared to constant tariff schemes. Results highlight the adaptability and scalability of the proposed mechanism to varying network configurations and size, demand profiles, and seasonal conditions.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the relationship between system imbalance and several explanatory variables within the French electricity system. The factors considered include lagged imbalance values, observations of renewable energy sources (RES) generation and consumption, and forecasts for RES generation and consumption. The study analyzes the distribution of system imbalance in relation to these variables. Additionally, an HGBR machine-learning model is employed to assess the predictability of imbalances and the explanatory power of the input variables studied. The results indicate no clear correlation between RES generation or consumption and the observed imbalances. However, it is possible to predict the imbalance adequately using forecasts available a few hours before real-time, along with the lagged values of the imbalance. Predicting the imbalance a day in advance proves to be complex with the variables examined; however, the extreme quantiles of the imbalance used for reserve sizing and contracting can be predicted with sufficient accuracy.</p>

            <p>The generation of audio-driven talking head videos is a key challenge in computer vision and graphics, with applications in virtual avatars and digital media. Traditional approaches often struggle with capturing the complex interaction between audio and facial dynamics, leading to lip synchronization and visual quality issues. In this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based framework, Dual Audio-Centric Modality Coupling (DAMC), which effectively integrates content and dynamic features from audio inputs. By leveraging a dual encoder structure, DAMC captures semantic content through the Content-Aware Encoder and ensures precise visual synchronization through the Dynamic-Sync Encoder. These features are fused using a Cross-Synchronized Fusion Module (CSFM), enhancing content representation and lip synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in key metrics such as lip synchronization accuracy and image quality, demonstrating robust generalization across various audio inputs, including synthetic speech from text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our results provide a promising solution for high-quality, audio-driven talking head generation and present a scalable approach for creating realistic talking heads.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have opened new avenues for dynamic data collection in challenging environments, such as sports fields during fast-paced sports action. For the purposes of monitoring sport events for dangerous injuries, we envision a coordinated UAV fleet designed to capture high-quality, multi-view video footage of collision events in real-time. The extracted video data is crucial for analyzing athletes' motions and investigating the probability of sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) during impacts. This research implemented a UAV fleet system on the NetLogo platform, utilizing custom collision detection algorithms to compare against traditional TV-coverage strategies. Our system supports decentralized data capture and autonomous processing, providing resilience in the rapidly evolving dynamics of sports collisions. The collaboration algorithm integrates both shared and local data to generate multi-step analyses aimed at determining the efficacy of custom methods in enhancing the accuracy of TBI prediction models. Missions are simulated in real-time within a two-dimensional model, focusing on the strategic capture of collision events that could lead to TBI, while considering operational constraints such as rapid UAV maneuvering and optimal positioning. Preliminary results from the NetLogo simulations suggest that custom collision detection methods offer superior performance over standard TV-coverage strategies by enabling more precise and timely data capture.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Declan Jagt, Sergei Chernyshenko, Matthew Peet</p>
            <p>Periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes on large or infinite domains using PDEs on finite intervals, assuming solutions within the interval to extend periodically to the larger domain. However, stability analysis of PDEs with periodic boundary conditions is complicated by underlying uniform solutions admitted by these conditions, potentially giving rise to non-isolated equilibria. To resolve this issue, in this paper, it is shown how such underlying solutions for linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions can be modeled separately using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any vector-valued function satisfying such boundary conditions is uniquely defined by its second-order derivative and some uniform or affine function, parameterized by auxiliary variables in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both the second-order derivative and auxiliary variables. Finally, a stability test for the PIE representation is formulated as a linear operator inequality, which can be solved using semidefinite programming. The proposed methodology is applied to two PDE examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beibei Li</p>
            <p>The accurate forecasting of geomagnetic activity is important. In this work, we present a novel multimodal Transformer based framework for predicting the 3 days and 5 days planetary Kp index by integrating heterogeneous data sources, including satellite measurements, solar images, and KP time series. A key innovation is the incorporation of the Wasserstein distance into the transformer and the loss function to align the probability distributions across modalities. Comparative experiments with the NOAA model demonstrate performance, accurately capturing both the quiet and storm phases of geomagnetic activity. This study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning techniques with traditional models for improved real time forecasting.</p>

            <h2>CrossMuSim: A Cross-Modal Framework for Music Similarity Retrieval with LLM-Powered Text Description Sourcing and Mining</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tristan Tsoi, Jiajun Deng, Yaolong Ju, Benno Weck, Holger Kirchhoff, Simon Lui</p>
            <p>Music similarity retrieval is fundamental for managing and exploring relevant content from large collections in streaming platforms. This paper presents a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework that leverages the open-ended nature of text descriptions to guide music similarity modeling, addressing the limitations of traditional uni-modal approaches in capturing complex musical relationships. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data, this paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach combining online scraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage LLMs' comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions. Exten1sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective metrics, subjective evaluations, and real-world A/B testing on the Huawei Music streaming platform.</p>

            <h2>Joint Source-Environment Adaptation for Deep Learning-Based Underwater Acoustic Source Ranging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dariush Kari, Andrew C. Singer</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a method to adapt a pre-trained deep-learning-based model for underwater acoustic localization to a new environment. We use unsupervised domain adaptation to improve the generalization performance of the model, i.e., using an unsupervised loss, fine-tune the pre-trained network parameters without access to any labels of the target environment or any data used to pre-train the model. This method improves the pre-trained model prediction by coupling that with an almost independent estimation based on the received signal energy (that depends on the source). We show the effectiveness of this approach on Bellhop generated data in an environment similar to that of the SWellEx-96 experiment contaminated with real ocean noise from the KAM11 experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yadong Xie, Fan Li, Yue Wu, Yu Wang</p>
            <p>Fitness can help to strengthen muscles, increase resistance to diseases, and improve body shape. Nowadays, a great number of people choose to exercise at home/office rather than at the gym due to lack of time. However, it is difficult for them to get good fitness effects without professional guidance. Motivated by this, we propose the first personalized fitness monitoring system, HearFit+, using smart speakers at home/office. We explore the feasibility of using acoustic sensing to monitor fitness. We design a fitness detection method based on Doppler shift and adopt the short time energy to segment fitness actions. Based on deep learning, HearFit+ can perform fitness classification and user identification at the same time. Combined with incremental learning, users can easily add new actions. We design 4 evaluation metrics (i.e., duration, intensity, continuity, and smoothness) to help users to improve fitness effects. Through extensive experiments including over 9,000 actions of 10 types of fitness from 12 volunteers, HearFit+ can achieve an average accuracy of 96.13% on fitness classification and 91% accuracy for user identification. All volunteers confirm that HearFit+ can help improve the fitness effect in various environments.</p>

            <h2>Speculative End-Turn Detector for Efficient Speech Chatbot Assistant</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Jaeho Lee</p>
            <p>Spoken dialogue systems powered by large language models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding human speech and generating appropriate spoken responses. However, these systems struggle with end-turn detection (ETD) -- the ability to distinguish between user turn completion and hesitation. This limitation often leads to premature or delayed responses, disrupting the flow of spoken conversations. In this paper, we introduce the ETD Dataset, the first public dataset for end-turn detection. The ETD dataset consists of both synthetic speech data generated with text-to-speech models and real-world speech data collected from web sources. We also propose SpeculativeETD, a novel collaborative inference framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to improve real-time ETD in resource-constrained environments. Our approach jointly employs a lightweight GRU-based model, which rapidly detects the non-speaking units in real-time on local devices, and a high-performance Wav2vec-based model running on the server to make a more challenging classification of distinguishing turn ends from mere pauses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpeculativeETD significantly improves ETD accuracy while keeping the required computations low. Datasets and code will be available after the review.</p>

            <p>The expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks into space introduces technical challenges that conventional bit-oriented communication approaches cannot efficiently address, including intermittent connectivity, severe latency, limited bandwidth, and constrained onboard resources. To overcome these limitations, semantic communication has emerged as a transformative paradigm, shifting the communication focus from transmitting raw data to delivering context-aware, missionrelevant information. In this article, we propose a semantic communication architecture explicitly tailored for the 6G Internet of Space (IoS), integrating multi-modal semantic processing, AIdriven semantic encoding and decoding, and adaptive transmission mechanisms optimized for space environments. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is demonstrated through a representative deep-space scenario involving semantic-based monitoring of Mars dust storms. Finally, we outline open research challenges and discuss future directions toward realizing practical semantic-enabled IoS systems.</p>

            <p>Proper recitation of the Quran, adhering to the rules of Tajweed, is crucial for preventing mistakes during recitation and requires significant effort to master. Traditional methods of teaching these rules are limited by the availability of qualified instructors and time constraints. Automatic evaluation of recitation can address these challenges by providing prompt feedback and supporting independent practice. This study focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify three Tajweed rules - separate stretching (Al Mad), tight noon (Ghunnah), and hide (Ikhfaa) - using the publicly available QDAT dataset, which contains over 1,500 audio recordings. The input data consisted of audio recordings from this dataset, transformed into normalized mel-spectrograms. For classification, the EfficientNet-B0 architecture was used, enhanced with a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. The developed model achieved accuracy rates of 95.35%, 99.34%, and 97.01% for the respective rules. An analysis of the learning curves confirmed the model's robustness and absence of overfitting. The proposed approach demonstrates high efficiency and paves the way for developing interactive educational systems for Tajweed study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niall O'Sullivan, Licio Romao, Kostas Margellos</p>
            <p>Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>
            <p>This work explores generalizations of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality (PLI) and their implications for the convergence behavior of gradient flows in optimization problems. Motivated by the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (CT-LQR) policy optimization problem -- where only a weaker version of the PLI is characterized in the literature -- this work shows that while weaker conditions are sufficient for global convergence to, and optimality of the set of critical points of the cost function, the "profile" of the gradient flow solution can change significantly depending on which "flavor" of inequality the cost satisfies. After a general theoretical analysis, we focus on fitting the CT-LQR policy optimization problem to the proposed framework, showing that, in fact, it can never satisfy a PLI in its strongest form. We follow up our analysis with a brief discussion on the difference between continuous- and discrete-time LQR policy optimization, and end the paper with some intuition on the extension of this framework to optimization problems with L1 regularization and solved through proximal gradient flows.</p>

            <h2>An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Gillis, Margherita Porcelli, Giovanni Seraghiti</p>
            <p>Nonlinear matrix decomposition (NMD) with the ReLU function, denoted ReLU-NMD, is the following problem: given a sparse, nonnegative matrix $X$ and a factorization rank $r$, identify a rank-$r$ matrix $\Theta$ such that $X\approx \max(0,\Theta)$. This decomposition finds application in data compression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold learning. The standard ReLU-NMD model minimizes the least squares error, that is, $\|X - \max(0,\Theta)\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem is nondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an alternative model, Latent-ReLU-NMD, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced and satisfies $\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\|Z - \Theta\|_F^2$ (``A nonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J. Math. Data Sci., 2022). Our first contribution is to show that the two formulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\Theta$; in particular, we show that Latent-ReLU-NMD can be ill-posed when ReLU-NMD is not, meaning that there are instances in which the infimum of Latent-ReLU-NMD is not attained while that of ReLU-NMD is. We also consider another alternative model, called 3B-ReLU-NMD, which parameterizes $\Theta=WH$, where $W$ has $r$ columns and $H$ has $r$ rows, allowing one to get rid of the rank constraint in Latent-ReLU-NMD. Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block coordinate descent (BCD) applied to 3B-ReLU-NMD and referred to as BCD-NMD. Our third contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD-NMD, dubbed eBCD-NMD, which we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions. We illustrate the significant acceleration effect of eBCD-NMD compared to BCD-NMD, and also show that eBCD-NMD performs well against the state of the art on synthetic and real-world data sets.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Otacilio B. L. Neto, Michela Mulas, Francesco Corona</p>
            <p>This work proposes an algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria (GFNE) in noncooperative dynamic games. The focus is on cyber-physical systems with dynamics which are linear, stochastic, potentially unstable, and partially observed. We employ System Level Synthesis (SLS) to reformulate the problem as the search for an equilibrium profile of closed-loop responses to noise, which can then be used to reconstruct a stabilising output-feedback policy. Under this setup, we leverage monotone operator theory to design a GFNE-seeking algorithm capable to enforce closed-loop stability, operational constraints, and communication constraints onto the control policies. This algorithm is amenable to numerical implementation and we provide conditions for its convergence. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated experiment on the noncooperative stabilisation of a decentralised power-grid.</p>

            <p>Cross-modal augmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and microscopic imaging based on the same tissue samples is promising because it can allow histopathological analysis in the absence of an underlying invasive biopsy procedure. Here, we tested a method for generating microscopic histological images from MRI scans of the corpus callosum using conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first multimodal translation of the brain MRI to histological volumetric representation of the same sample. The technique was assessed by training paired image translation models taking sets of images from MRI scans and microscopy. The use of cGAN for this purpose is challenging because microscopy images are large in size and typically have low sample availability. The current work demonstrates that the framework reliably synthesizes histology images from MRI scans of corpus callosum, emphasizing the network's ability to train on high resolution histologies paired with relatively lower-resolution MRI scans. With the ultimate goal of avoiding biopsies, the proposed tool can be used for educational purposes.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{á}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors. The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</p>

            <p>The signal differentiation problem involves the development of algorithms that allow to recover a signal's derivatives from noisy measurements. This paper develops a first-order differentiator with the following combination of properties: robustness to measurement noise, exactness in the absence of noise, optimal worst-case differentiation error, and Lipschitz continuous output where the output's Lipschitz constant is a tunable parameter. This combination of advantageous properties is not shared by any existing differentiator. Both continuous-time and sample-based versions of the differentiator are developed and theoretical guarantees are established for both. The continuous-time version of the differentiator consists in a regularized and sliding-mode-filtered linear adaptive differentiator. The sample-based, implementable version is then obtained through appropriate discretization. An illustrative example is provided to highlight the features of the developed differentiator.</p>

            <p>Uncrewed Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network (e.g., mobile base stations) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how uncrewed vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potential at this intersection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samiya A Alkhairy</p>
            <p>We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second-order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Exponent Filters (GEFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-exponent GEFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters without additional complexity in causality and stability analyses compared with classical filters. In the case of GEFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</p>

            <p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control strategy suited for flood control of water resources infrastructure. Despite many studies on reservoir flood control and their theoretical contribution, optimisation methodologies have not been widely applied in real-time operation due to disparities between research assumptions and practical requirements. To address this gap, we include practical objectives, such as minimising the magnitude and frequency of changes in the existing outflow schedule. Incorporating these objectives transforms the problem into a multi-objective nonlinear optimisation problem that is difficult to solve in real-time. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that the weights and some parameters, considered the operators' preferences, vary depending on the system state. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that converts the original intractable problem into parameterized linear MPC problems with dynamic optimisation of weights and parameters. This is done by introducing a model-based learning concept. We refer to this framework as Parameterised Dynamic MPC (PD-MPC). The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a numerical experiment for the Daecheong multipurpose reservoir in South Korea. We find that PD-MPC outperforms standard MPC-based designs without a dynamic optimisation process for the objective weights and model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the weights and parameters vary with changing hydrological conditions.</p>

            <p>To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianwei Xia, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</p>

            <p>Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential 6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we study how to enforce channel orthogonality in a panel-based LIS (P-LIS) scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating in a novel low-power mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx) process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we characterize the RRTx processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the orthogonality constraint to minimize the RRTx processing power, where we derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of the proposed scheme.</p>

Existing methods often overlook the effect of room geometry, particularly wall occlusions on sound propagation, making them less accurate in multi-room environments. In this work, we propose a new approach called Scene Occlusion-aware Acoustic Field (SOAF) for accurate sound generation. Our approach derives a global prior for the sound field using distance-aware parametric sound-propagation modeling and then transforms it based on the scene structure learned from the input video. We extract features from the local acoustic field centered at the receiver using a Fibonacci Sphere to generate binaural audio for novel views with a direction-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the real dataset RWAVS and the synthetic dataset SoundSpaces demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques in audio generation.</p>

            <p>Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.</p>

Common satellites produce both a panchromatic and multispectral image, which contain high spatial and spectral information respectively. Current neural reconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a pansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However, these methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps. FusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel cross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present in multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral and panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF also leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image characteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By optimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while performing reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening preprocessing step. We evaluate our method on multispectral and panchromatic satellite images from the WorldView-3 satellite in various locations, and show that FusionRF provides an average of 17% improvement in depth reconstruction accuracy, and renders sharp training and novel views.</p>

            <h2>FlowMRI-Net: A Generalizable Self-Supervised 4D Flow MRI Reconstruction network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luuk Jacobs, Marco Piccirelli, Valery Vishnevskiy, Sebastian Kozerke</p>
            <p>Background: Image reconstruction from highly undersampled 4D flow MRI data can be very time consuming and may result in significant underestimation of velocities depending on regularization, thereby limiting the applicability of the method. The objective of the present work was to develop a generalizable self-supervised deep learning-based framework for fast and accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled 4D flow MRI and to demonstrate the utility of the framework for aortic and cerebrovascular applications. Methods: The proposed deep-learning-based framework, called FlowMRI-Net, employs physics-driven unrolled optimization using a complex-valued convolutional recurrent neural network and is trained in a self-supervised manner. The generalizability of the framework is evaluated using aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI acquisitions acquired on systems from two different vendors for various undersampling factors (R=8,16,24) and compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS-LLR) and deep learning-based (FlowVN) reconstructions. Evaluation includes an ablation study and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of image and velocity magnitudes. Results: FlowMRI-Net outperforms CS-LLR and FlowVN for aortic 4D flow MRI reconstruction, resulting in significantly lower vectorial normalized root mean square error and mean directional errors for velocities in the thoracic aorta. Furthermore, the feasibility of FlowMRI-Net's generalizability is demonstrated for cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI reconstruction, where no FlowVN can be trained due to the lack of high-quality reference data. Reconstruction times ranged from 3 to 7 minutes on commodity CPU/GPU hardware. Conclusion: FlowMRI-Net enables fast and accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI, with possible applications to other vascular territories.</p>

            <p>Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data have emerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data, suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems. To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</p>

            <p>The fusion of speech and language in the era of large language models has garnered significant attention. Discrete speech token is often utilized in text-to-speech tasks for speech compression and portability, which is convenient for joint training with text and have good compression efficiency. However, we found that the discrete speech tokenizer still suffers from information loss. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective continuous speech tokenizer named Cont-SPT, and a text-to-speech model based on continuous speech tokens. Our results show that the speech language model based on the continuous speech tokenizer has better continuity and higher estimated Mean Opinion Scores (MoS). This enhancement is attributed to better information preservation rate of the continuous speech tokenizer across both low and high frequencies in the frequency domain.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Karageorgiou, Symeon Papadopoulos, Ioannis Kompatsiaris, Efstratios Gavves</p>
            <p>Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.

            <h2>Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Chen, Ruiguo Zhong, Kehua Chen, Zhiwei Shang, Meixin Zhu, Edward Chung</p>
            <p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p>

            <h2>MoMuSE: Momentum Multi-modal Target Speaker Extraction for Real-time Scenarios with Impaired Visual Cues</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjie Li, Ke Zhang, Shuai Wang, Kong Aik Lee, Man-Wai Mak, Haizhou Li</p>
            <p>Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate the speech of a specific target speaker from an audio mixture using time-synchronized visual cues. In real-world scenarios, visual cues are not always available due to various impairments, which undermines the stability of AV-TSE. Despite this challenge, humans can maintain attentional momentum over time, even when the target speaker is not visible. In this paper, we introduce the Momentum Multi-modal target Speaker Extraction (MoMuSE), which retains a speaker identity momentum in memory, enabling the model to continuously track the target speaker. Designed for real-time inference, MoMuSE extracts the current speech window with guidance from both visual cues and dynamically updated speaker momentum. Experimental results demonstrate that MoMuSE exhibits significant improvement, particularly in scenarios with severe impairment of visual cues.</p>

            <h2>Certainty-Equivalence Model Predictive Control: Stability, Performance, and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changrui Liu, Shengling Shi, Bart De Schutter</p>
            <p>Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model-based controller design, particularly in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is effective in managing uncertainties, its conservatism often makes it less desirable in practice. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which relies on a nominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and low computational requirements. Contrary to the existing analyses where MPC has access to the true model, this paper investigates CE-MPC for uncertain nonlinear systems with input constraints and parametric uncertainty. The primary contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, a novel perturbation analysis of the MPC value function is provided, without relying on the common assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the stage cost, better tailoring the popular quadratic cost and having broader applicability to value function approximation, online model learning in MPC, and performance-driven MPC design. Second, the stability and performance analysis of CE-MPC are provided, with a quantification of the suboptimality of CE-MPC compared to the infinite-horizon optimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide valuable insights in how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect stability and performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to linear quadratic control, and a competitive ratio bound is derived, serving as the first competitive-ratio bound for MPC of uncertain linear systems with input constraints and multiplicative uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajia Guo, Yiming Cui, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt-enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. To further enhance reconstruction quality, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilana Shapiro, Ruanqianqian Huang, Zachary Novack, Cheng-i Wang, Hao-Wen Dong, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Shlomo Dubnov, Sorin Lerner</p>
            <p>Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lam Pham, Dat Tran, Phat Lam, Florian Skopik, Alexander Schindler, Silvia Poletti, David Fischinger, Martin Boyer</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach for deepfake speech detection (DSD) based on a lowcomplexity Depthwise-Inception Network (DIN) trained with a contrastive training strategy (CTS). In this framework, input audio recordings are first transformed into spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Linear Filter (LF), which are then used to train the DIN. Once trained, the DIN processes bonafide utterances to extract audio embeddings, which are used to construct a Gaussian distribution representing genuine speech. Deepfake detection is then performed by computing the distance between a test utterance and this distribution to determine whether the utterance is fake or bonafide. To evaluate our proposed systems, we conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset of ASVspoof 2019 LA. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the Depthwise-Inception Network with the contrastive learning strategy in distinguishing between fake and bonafide utterances. We achieved Equal Error Rate (EER), Accuracy (Acc.), F1, AUC scores of 4.6%, 95.4%, 97.3%, and 98.9% respectively using a single, low-complexity DIN with just 1.77 M parameters and 985 M FLOPS on short audio segments (4 seconds). Furthermore, our proposed system outperforms the single-system submissions in the ASVspoof 2019 LA challenge, showcasing its potential for real-time applications.</p>

            <p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an essential component of computer assisted language learning (CALL) and computer assisted language testing (CALT) for many years. As this technology continues to develop rapidly, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of current ASR systems for language learning applications. This study assesses five cutting-edge ASR systems' recognition of non-native accented English speech using recordings from the L2-ARCTIC corpus, featuring speakers from six different L1 backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese), in the form of both read and spontaneous speech. The read speech consisted of 2,400 single sentence recordings from 24 speakers, while the spontaneous speech included narrative recordings from 22 speakers. Results showed that for read speech, Whisper and AssemblyAI achieved the best accuracy with mean Match Error Rates (MER) of 0.054 and 0.056 respectively, approaching human-level accuracy. For spontaneous speech, RevAI performed best with a mean MER of 0.063. The study also examined how each system handled disfluencies such as filler words, repetitions, and revisions, finding significant variation in performance across systems and disfluency types. While processing speed varied considerably between systems, longer processing times did not necessarily correlate with better accuracy. By detailing the performance of several of the most recent, widely-available ASR systems on non-native English speech, this study aims to help language instructors and researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of each system and identify which may be suitable for specific use cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu</p>
            <p>Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Clemente</p>
            <p>The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series. Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Schützenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo F. C. Varaschin, Danilo Silva</p>
            <p>To address the high levels of uncertainty associated with photovoltaic energy, an increasing number of studies focusing on short-term solar forecasting have been published. Most of these studies use deep learning-based models to directly forecast a solar irradiance or photovoltaic power value given an input of sky image sequences. Recently, however, advances in generative modeling have led to approaches that divide the forecasting problem into two sub-problems: 1) future event prediction, i.e. generating future sky images; and 2) solar irradiance or photovoltaic power nowcasting, i.e. predicting the concurrent value from a single image. One such approach is the SkyGPT model, where they show that the potential for improvement is much larger for the nowcasting model than for the generative model. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the solar irradiance nowcasting problem and conduct an extensive benchmark of deep learning architectures across the widely-used Folsom, SIRTA and NREL datasets. Moreover, we perform ablation experiments on different training configurations and data processing techniques, including the choice of the target variable used for training and adjustments of the timestamp alignment between images and irradiance measurements. In particular, we draw attention to a potential error associated with the sky image timestamps in the Folsom dataset and a possible fix is discussed. All our results are reported in terms of both the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error and, by leveraging the three datasets, we demonstrate that our findings are consistent across different solar stations.</p>

            <p>This work identifies the general approach for linearising any power system component in the harmonic domain, that is with respect to its Fourier series coefficients. This ability enables detailed harmonic analysis, and is key as more power electronic devices inject harmonic currents into the power system to its shared detriment. The general approach requires a time domain model of the component, and is most applicable where a conversion to the frequency domain is impractical prior to linearisation. The outcome is a Norton equivalent current source, which expresses linear coupling between harmonic frequencies with admittance matrices. These are the so-called frequency coupling matrices. The general approach is demonstrated for magnetic hysteresis, where a Preisach model has been developed for this purpose. A new data driven approach is used to fit the test results of a small physical transformer to the Preisach model. Results show an improved accuracy in the frequency coupling matrices over models that only considered magnetic saturation. Maximum improvement is observed in the odd harmonic current to odd harmonic voltage couplings.</p>

            <p>These days, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems have drawn a lot of attention due to the increasing demand for faster data rates. Given the susceptibility of mmWave signals to obstacles and high propagation loss of mmWaves, ensuring line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity is critical for maintaining robust and efficient communication. Furthermore, UAVs have limited power resource and limited capacity in terms of number of users it can serve. Most significantly different users have different delay requirements and they keep moving while interacting with the UAVs. In this paper, first, we have provided an efficient solution for the optimal movement of the UAVs, by taking into account the energy efficiency of the UAVs as well as the mobility and delay priority of the users. Next, we have proposed a greedy solution for the optimal user-UAV assignment. After that, the numerical results show how well the suggested solution performs in comparison to the current benchmarks in terms of delay suffered by the users, number of unserved users, and energy efficiency of the UAVs.</p>

            <p>The concept of dispatchable region plays a pivotal role in quantifying the capacity of power systems to accommodate renewable generation. In this paper, we extend the previous approximations of the dispatchable regions on direct current (DC), linearized, and nonlinear single-phase alternating current (AC) models to unbalanced three-phase radial (tree) networks and provide improved outer and inner approximations of dispatchable regions. Based on the nonlinear bus injection model (BIM), we relax the non-convex problem that defines the dispatchable region to a solvable semidefinite program (SDP) and derive its strong dual problem (which is also an SDP). Utilizing the special mathematical structure of the dual problem, an SDP-based projection algorithm is developed to construct a convex polytopic outer approximation to the SDP-relaxed dispatchable region. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the exact SDP relaxation by adding the power loss as a penalty term, thereby providing a theoretical guarantee for determining an inner approximation of the dispatchable region. Through numerical simulations, we validate the accuracy of our approximation of the dispatchable region and verify the conditions for exact SDP relaxation.</p>

            <p>To encourage the participation of stochastic distributed energy resources in Nordic ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, has introduced grid codes requiring a minimum 90% reliability for the full availability of reserve capacity bids. This paper addresses the bidding strategy of flexibility aggregators under Energinet's reliability requirement by proposing a chance-constrained optimization model. An analytical solution is developed using ideas from extreme value theory, focusing on the "tail" of the empirical data used for flexibility estimation, capturing extreme events where failures are more likely to occur. The proposed model is applied to an electric vehicle aggregator participating in the Nordic market for frequency containment reserve for disturbances (FCR-D). Our results from a realistic case study show that the proposed analytical solution outperforms a commonly used sample-based approach in terms of out-of-sample constraint violation rate.</p>

            <p>Transformers are essential components for the reliable operation of power grids. The transformer core is constituted by a ferromagnetic material, and accordingly, depending on the magnetization state, the energization of the transformer can lead to high magnetizing inrush currents. Such high amplitudes shorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in power grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush current; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this challenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn inrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation environment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by combining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the circuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method learns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms have been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a real 7.4 MVA power transformer. The evaluation of the RL algorithms is carried out with real measurement data and compared with real laboratory inrush currents. The results show that the inrush current is effectively minimized with the proposed framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation, current sharing, and Constant Power Load (CPL) stability in DC microgrids (MGs). We describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where DGs, lines, and nonlinear loads (including destabilizing CPLs) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller, designed using dissipativity properties and sector-bounded techniques. For controller synthesis, we formulate a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem that simultaneously addresses voltage regulation, current sharing, and CPL stability guarantees. To support the feasibility of this problem, we propose a sector-bounded approach that characterizes CPL nonlinearities and integrates them into the dissipativity framework through S-procedure techniques. Our approach provides a unified framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies that ensure stability despite the presence of destabilizing CPL effects.

            <h2>Cubature Kalman Filter as a Robust State Estimator Against Model Uncertainty and Cyber Attacks in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tohid Kargar Tasooji, Sakineh Khodadadi</p>
            <p>It is known that the conventional estimators such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) may provide favorable performance; However, they may not guarantee the robustness against model uncertainty and cyber attacks. In this paper, we compare the performance of cubature Kalman filter (CKF) to the conventional nonlinear estimator, the EKF, under the affect of model uncertainty and cyber-attack. We show that the CKF has better estimation accuracy than the EKF under some conditions. In order to verify our claim, we have tested the performance various nonlinear estimators on the single machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system under different scenarios. We show that (1) the CKF provides better estimation results than the EKF; (2) the CKF is able to detect different types of cyber attacks reliably which is superior to the EKF.</p>

            <h2>System-wide Instrument Transformer Calibration and Line Parameter Estimation Using PMU Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antos Cheeramban Varghese, Anamitra Pal</p>
            <p>Uncalibrated instrument transformers (ITs) can degrade the performance of downstream applications that rely on the voltage and current measurements that ITs provide. It is also well-known that phasor measurement unit (PMU)-based system-wide IT calibration and line parameter estimation (LPE) are interdependent problems. In this paper, we present a statistical framework for solving the simultaneous LPE and IT calibration (SLIC) problem using synchrophasor data. The proposed approach not only avoids the need for a perfect IT by judiciously placing a revenue quality meter (which is an expensive but non-perfect IT), but also accounts for the variations typically occurring in the line parameters. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system as well as actual power system data demonstrate the high accuracy, robustness, and practical utility of the proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 42.85\%. Furthermore, the proposed method ensures that the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) remain within acceptable limits, significantly improving system resilience in inertia-less power networks.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel modeling approach for building performance simulation, characterized as a white-box model with a high degree of modularity and flexibility, enabling direct integration into complex large-scale energy system co-simulations. The introduced model is described in detail, with a focus on its modular structure, and proposes various configurations that include various building insulation, heating methods, occupancy patterns, and weather data to analyze different scenarios, and the energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and heating costs are compared and analyzed across 36 introduced scenarios. The thermodynamic behavior of the model is shown to be consistent with real-world conditions, and the comparison of the scenarios concludes that the use of heat pumps for indoor heating in well-insulated buildings has significant economic and sustainability benefits, whereas the use of natural gas-fueled boilers is more cost-effective for buildings with low energy ratings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyavrat Wagle, Akshay Malhotra, Shahab Hamidi-Rad, Aditya Sant, David J. Love, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
            <p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario of interest. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating a parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PBGC) modeling framework with generative methods. To address limitations with gradient flow through the PBGC model, a linearized reformulation is presented, which ensures smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also capturing insights about the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through the utility of generated data when used for downstream compression tasks.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Multi-Task Electric Energy System Intelligence: Data Scaling Laws and Performance with Limited Fine-Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaohuai Liu, Lin Dong, Chao Tian, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Data scaling has revolutionized research fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics control, providing foundation models with remarkable multi-task and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in developing foundation models for power systems, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield multi-task, cross-timescales capabilities that can be deployed in \textit{unseen} operational scenarios. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling by fine-tuning open-source foundation models using labeled data collected from diverse operational tasks and scenarios. We study how a foundation model's scenario generalization performance evolves with the number of training tasks, scenarios, and demonstrations. Our study involved collecting more than 450k demonstrations and implementing independent tests under a rigorous evaluation framework. Our findings reveal several key insights: First, the generalization performance of a fine-tuned foundation model follows an approximate power-law relationship with the number of demonstrations and scenarios. Second, the fine-tuned model also demonstrates impressive multi-task capabilities, where multi-task training shares similar performance improvements with single-task training as the number of demonstrations increases, without interference among tasks. Lastly, models with small parameter sizes could have strong performance as well. Model performance does not scale significantly with parameter size. These findings underscore the feasibility of developing multi-task foundation models tailored for power systems, demonstrating that while larger datasets and models generally improve performance, extreme scaling is unnecessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes.</p>

            <p>This study focuses on the feasibility analyses of the hybrid FSO and RF-based WPT system used in the realistic Cislunar environment, which is established by using STK HPOP software in which many external forces are incorporated. In our proposed multi-hop scheme, a solar-powered satellite (SPS) beams the laser power to the low lunar orbit (LLO) satellite in the first hop, then the harvested power is used as a relay power for RF-based WPT to two critical lunar regions, which are lunar south pole (LSP) (0°E,90°S) and Malapert Mountain (0°E,86°S), owing to the multi-point coverage feature of RF systems. The end-to-end system is analyzed for two cases, i) the perfect alignment, and ii) the misalignment fading due to the random mechanical vibrations in the optical inter-satellite link. It is found that the harvested power is maximized when the distance between the SPS and LLO satellite is minimized and it is calculated as 331.94 kW, however, when the random misalignment fading is considered, the mean of the harvested power reduces to 309.49 kW for the same distance. In the next hop, the power harvested by the solar array on the LLO satellite is consumed entirely as the relay power. Identical parabolic antennas are considered during the RF-based WPT system between the LLO satellite and the LSP, which utilizes a full-tracking module, and between the LLO satellite and the Malapert Mountain region, which uses a half-tracking module that executes the tracking on the receiver dish only. In the perfectly aligned hybrid WPT system, 19.80 W and 573.7 mW of maximum harvested powers are yielded at the LSP and Mountain Malapert, respectively. On the other hand, when the misalignment fading in the end-to-end system is considered, the mean of the maximum harvested powers degrades to 18.41 W and 534.4 mW for the former and latter hybrid WPT links.</p>

            <h2>Small-Signal Stability Condition of Inverter-Integrated Power Systems: Closed-Form Expression by Stationary Power Flow Variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taku Nishino, Yoshiyuki Onishi, Takayuki Ishizaki</p>
            <p>This paper shows that a necessary and sufficient condition for the small-signal stability of an inverter-integrated power system can be expressed in terms of semidefinite matrix inequalities determined only by the synchronous reactance of the components, the susceptance matrix of the transmission network, and the stationary values of the power flow distribution. To derive the stability condition, we consider a class of grid-forming inverters corresponding to a singular perturbation of the synchronous generator. The resulting matrix inequality condition, which has twice as many dimensions as the number of buses and is independent of the dynamics of the connected components, is expressed in terms of each component compensating in a decentralized manner for the loss of frequency synchronization caused by the reactive power consumption in the transmission network. A simple numerical example using a 3-bus power system model shows that a grid-forming inverter load improves power system synchronization, while a grid-following inverter load disrupts it.</p>

            <p>As power systems expand, solving the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) becomes increasingly challenging due to the dimensional catastrophe, and traditional methods often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose a problem-structure-informed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework that fully exploits the quantum advantage under extremely limited quantum resources. Specifically, we leverage the inherent topological structure of power systems to decompose large-scale UCP instances into smaller subproblems, each solvable in parallel by limited number of qubits. This decomposition not only circumvents the current hardware limitations of quantum computing but also achieves higher performance as the graph structure of the power system becomes more sparse. Consequently, our approach can be readily extended to future power systems that are larger and more complex.</p>

            <h2>Agent-Based Analysis of the Impact of Near Real-Time Data and Smart Balancing on the Frequency Stability of Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Lips, Boyana Georgieva, Dominik Schlipf, Hendrik Lens</p>
            <p>Single imbalance pricing provides an incentive to balance responsible parties (BRPs) to intentionally introduce power schedule deviations in order to reduce the control area imbalance and receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. This is called smart balancing or passive balancing and is actively encouraged in, e.g., the Netherlands and Belgium through the publication of near real-time (NRT) data on the control area imbalance by the transmission system operator. It is known that under certain conditions, smart balancing can deteriorate the frequency stability of the power system. This paper examines how the publication of different types of NRT data affects smart balancing and the frequency stability. A Monte-Carlo simulation of a dynamic multi-agent model is performed to analyse the effects of smart balancing with different parameters for the agents and the environment, using historical time series of the power imbalance of the German control block as a basis. It is found that smart balancing can significantly reduce the amount and cost of frequency restoration reserve activation, but leads to a general increase of the frequency variability. Depending on the type of NRT data and agent parameters, the frequency stability margins are also reduced. The negative effects on the frequency stability are stronger when NRT data is published using large bins and with long delays.</p>

            <h2>Insights from Game Theory into the Impact of Smart Balancing on Power System Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Lips, Hendrik Lens</p>
            <p>Smart balancing, also called passive balancing, is the intentional introduction of active power schedule deviations by balance responsible parties (BRPs) to receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. From a system perspective, smart balancing is meant to reduce the need for, and costs of, frequency restoration reserves (FRR), but it can also cause large oscillations in the FRR and jeopardize the system stability. Using a dynamic control area model, this work defines a 2x2 game in which two BRPs can choose to perform smart balancing. We study the impact of time delay, ramp rates, and pricing mechanisms on Nash equilibria and Experience-weighted Attraction (EWA) learning. It is found that, even in an idealized setting, a significant fraction of games in a learned equilibrium results in an overreaction relative to the baseline disturbance, creating an imbalance in the opposite direction. This suggests that the system stability risks are inherent to smart balancing and not a question of implementation. Recommendations are given for implementation choices that can reduce (but not eliminate) the risk of overreactions.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven Modeling of Linearizable Power Flow for Large-scale Grid Topology Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>Effective power flow (PF) modeling critically affects the solution accuracy and computational complexity of large-scale grid optimization problems. Especially for grid optimization involving flexible topology to enhance resilience, obtaining a tractable yet accurate approximation of nonlinear AC-PF is essential. This work puts forth a data-driven approach to obtain piecewise linear (PWL) PF approximation using an innovative neural network (NN) architecture, effectively aligning with the inherent generative structure of AC-PF equations. Accordingly, our proposed generative NN (GenNN) method directly incorporates binary topology variables, efficiently enabling a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation for grid optimization tasks like optimal transmission switching (OTS) and restoration ordering problems (ROP). To attain model scalability for large-scale applications, we develop an area-partitioning-based sparsification approach by using fixed-size areas to attain a linear growth rate of model parameters, as opposed to the quadratic one of existing work. Numerical tests on the IEEE 118-bus and 6716-bus synthetic Texas grid demonstrate that our sparse GenNN achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency, substantially outperforming existing approaches in large-scale PF modeling and topology optimization.</p>

            <h2>Betting vs. Trading: Learning a Linear Decision Policy for Selling Wind Power and Hydrogen</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Heiser, Farzaneh Pourahmadi, Jalal Kazempour</p>
            <p>We develop a bidding strategy for a hybrid power plant combining co-located wind turbines and an electrolyzer, constructing a price-quantity bidding curve for the day-ahead electricity market while optimally scheduling hydrogen production. Without risk management, single imbalance pricing leads to an all-or-nothing trading strategy, which we term 'betting'. To address this, we propose a data-driven, pragmatic approach that leverages contextual information to train linear decision policies for both power bidding and hydrogen scheduling. By introducing explicit risk constraints to limit imbalances, we move from the all-or-nothing approach to a 'trading" strategy', where the plant diversifies its power trading decisions. We evaluate the model under three scenarios: when the plant is either conditionally allowed, always allowed, or not allowed to buy power from the grid, which impacts the green certification of the hydrogen produced. Comparing our data-driven strategy with an oracle model that has perfect foresight, we show that the risk-constrained, data-driven approach delivers satisfactory performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongze Zhang, Wei Yu</p>
            <p>This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes learning-based approaches for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Malmer, Arvid Rolander, Emil Hillberg, Olof Samuelsson, Susanne Ackeby, Lars Nordström</p>
            <p>The urgent need to address climate change prompts societies worldwide to adopt carbon neutral energy and electrification. To facilitate this, a range of technologies and policies will be needed. Alternatives to traditional power grid reinforcement, such as grid-enhancing technologies and system automation, are particularly attractive due to their potentially low cost and fast deployment time. One alternative is System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) - automatic and curative remedial actions (RAs) which can boost grid transfer capacities without compromising with reliability since they can act faster than manual control. The use of SIPS however is scattered, with limited coordination between countries, and the full potential of using SIPS for capacity enhancement is not yet realized. The aim of this paper is to provide a case study and comparison of SIPS in the Nordic countries, particularly in relation to capacity allocation. It also seeks to harmonize terminology relating to ancillary services, RAs, and SIPS. Finally, it examines and compares the inclusion of RAs and SIPS in different Capacity Calculation Methodologies (CCMs). In both main EU CCMs - Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) and Flow-Based (FB) - RAs play a pronounced role. The paper is based on a survey and interviews with Nordic stakeholders, along with a literature review and analysis of public data. The results indicate a large variation in SIPS use across the Nordics. Regarding terminology, we suggest that SIPS is a subcategory of RAs which overlaps with ancillary services. Concerning CCMs, NTC is unable to fully represent capacity constraints in meshed AC systems, which in turn hinders systematic capacity enhancement using RAs. FB on the other hand explicitly includes RAs in the capacity domain. A lower bound for the economic value of RAs can be calculated, amounting to 11.5 million EUR in the Nordics in Nov and Dec 2024.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Yao, Yijie Mao, Mingzhe Chen, Ye Hu</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising solution for enhancing localization accuracy. Traditional RIS-based localization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning, and pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy and computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base station (BS) and the RIS. To address these challenges, in this work, we move beyond conventional methods and introduce a novel data-driven, multiple RISs-assisted passive localization approach (RAPL). The proposed method includes two stages, the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the user is estimated by using the conditional sample mean in the first stage, and then the user's position is determined based on the estimated multiple AoD pairs in the second stage. This approach only utilizes the existing communication signals between the user and the BS, relying solely on the measurement of received signal power at each BS antenna for a set of randomly generated phase shifts across all RISs. Moreover, by obviating the need for real-time RIS phase shift optimization or user-to-BS pilot transmissions, the method introduces no additional communication overhead, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-world networks. The proposed scheme is then extended to multi-RIS scenarios considering both parallel and cascaded RIS topologies. Numerical results show that the proposed RAPL improves localization accuracy while significantly reducing energy and signaling overhead compared to conventional methods.</p>

            <p>The secure affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform design is a main concern in high-mobility networks. In this article, we employ the four key parameters in AFDM to design secure waveforms, and afterward we analyze the role of the four parameters to reveal the design guideline. We find that c1 is bounded by the Doppler shifts and preset guard. The parameter c2 exhibits a minimum periodicity of 1, with the effective range [0, 1] rather than any real number. The adjustable parameters c1 and c2 introduce additional degrees of freedom to the AFDM waveform, thereby enhancing the anti-eavesdropping performance. In addition, excessive Lmax that determines the preset guard interval leads to a security-risk interval and poses eavesdropping risks. Therefore, the optimal Lmax equals maximum delay. Numerical simulations verify the accuracy of our analysis.</p>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that, with a sufficiently rich dataset, the model error is bounded by a function of quantization resolution and the MPC tracking error is also ultimately bounded similarly.

            <p>Safety is of paramount importance in control systems to avoid costly risks and catastrophic damages. The control barrier function (CBF) method, a promising solution for safety-critical control, poses a new challenge of enhancing control performance due to its direct modification of original control design and the introduction of uncalibrated parameters. In this work, we shed light on the crucial role of configurable parameters in the CBF method for performance enhancement with a systematical categorization. Based on that, we propose a novel framework combining the CBF method with Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the safe control performance. Considering feasibility/safety-critical constraints, we develop a safe version of BO using the barrier-based interior method to efficiently search for promising feasible configurable parameters. Furthermore, we provide theoretical criteria of our framework regarding safety and optimality. An essential advantage of our framework lies in that it can work in model-agnostic environments, leaving sufficient flexibility in designing objective and constraint functions. Finally, simulation experiments on swing-up control and high-fidelity adaptive cruise control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungtaek Kim, Jonghyup Lee, Kyoungseok Han, Seibum B. Choi</p>
            <p>To address the computational challenges of Model Predictive Control (MPC), recent research has studied on using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained through imitation learning to approximate the MPC. However, this introduces a common issue in learning-based control: the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap. Therefore, Domain Randomization (DR) has been widely used to mitigate this gap by introducing perturbations in the source domain. However, this led to low data collection efficiency and an overly conservative control strategy. This study proposes a new control framework that deals with this issue from a control perspective inspired by Robust Tube MPC. The framework ensures the DNN operates in the same environment as the source domain, handling the sim-to-real gap with great data collection efficiency. Moreover, a parameter governor is introduced to address the DNN's inability to adapt to model parameter variations, enabling the system to satisfy MPC constraints more robustly under changing conditions. The proposed framework was validated through a cart-pole system case study compared by DR baselines, demonstrating that a single MPC-demonstrated trajectory in the source domain was sufficient for controlling the cart-pole in the target domain. Furthermore, the system effectively handled model parameter variations, allowing for a less conservative control.</p>

ILC can be combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to mitigate non-repetitive disturbances, thus improving overall system performance.

To address these limitations we propose a binary mixed-integer ILC scheme, combined with a convex MPC scheme, that ensures robust constraint satisfaction, non-increasing nominal cost, and convergence to optimal performance. Our scheme is designed for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to both bounded additive stochastic noise and additive uncertain components. We showcase the benefits of our scheme in simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingqing Chen, Christos G. Cassandras</p>
            <p>This paper develops an Optimal Safe Sequencing (OSS) control framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) navigating a single-lane roundabout in mixed traffic, where both CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) coexist. The framework jointly optimizes vehicle sequencing and motion control to minimize travel time, energy consumption, and discomfort while ensuring speed-dependent safety guarantees and adhering to velocity and acceleration constraints. This is achieved by integrating (a) a Safe Sequencing (SS) policy that ensures merging safety without requiring any knowledge of HDV behavior, and (b) a Model Predictive Control with Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions (MPC-CLBF) framework, which optimizes CAV motion control while mitigating infeasibility and myopic control issues common in the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees. Simulation results across various traffic demands, CAV penetration rates, and control parameters demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and stability.</p>

            <h2>Infinite-Horizon Optimal Wireless Control Over Shared State-Dependent Fading Channels for IIoT Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuling Wang, Peizhe Li, Shanying Zhu, Cailian Chen, Xinping Guan</p>
            <p>Heterogeneous systems consisting of a multiloop wireless control system (WCS) and a mobile agent system (MAS) are ubiquitous in Industrial Internet of Things systems. Within these systems, the positions of mobile agents may lead to shadow fading on the wireless channel that the WCS is controlled over and can significantly compromise its performance, requiring joint coordination between the WCS and MAS. Such coordination introduces different time steps and hybrid state spaces consisting of logical components and continuous components. This paper focuses on the infinite-horizon optimal control of MAS to ensure the performance of WCS while minimizing an average cost for the heterogeneous system subject to safety constraints. A state-dependent fading channel is modeled to capture interference among transmission links, as well as the effects of mobile agents' movements on successful wireless transmission. In order to address the heterogeneous system dynamics, the optimal control problem is formulated as the optimal constrained set stabilization of the MAS by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for the Lyapunov-like performance of WCS with the expected decay rates. Using the semi-tensor product of matrices, a constrained optimal state transition graph is constructed to encode the constrained system dynamics as well as objective function, which further reduces the problem into a minimum-mean cycle problem for the graph. By studying the properties of the graph, the feasibility is proven, and an effective algorithm is proposed for the construction of optimal input sequences. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Disease-Aware Training Strategy for Cardiac MR Image Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Zheng, Yucheng Chen, Nan Mu, Xiaoning Li</p>
            <p>Accurate segmentation of the ventricles from cardiac magnetic resonance images (CMRIs) is crucial for enhancing the diagnosis and analysis of heart conditions. Deep learning-based segmentation methods have recently garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance. However, these segmentation methods are typically good at partitioning regularly shaped organs, such as the left ventricle (LV) and the myocardium (MYO), whereas they perform poorly on irregularly shaped organs, such as the right ventricle (RV). In this study, we argue that this limitation of segmentation models stems from their insufficient generalization ability to address the distribution shift of segmentation targets across slices, cardiac phases, and disease conditions. To overcome this issue, we present a Multi-Disease-Aware Training Strategy (MTS) and restructure the introduced CMRI datasets into multi-disease datasets. Additionally, we propose a specialized data processing technique for preprocessing input images to support the MTS. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we performed control group experiments and cross-validation tests. The experimental results show that (1) network models trained using our proposed strategy achieved superior segmentation performance, particularly in RV segmentation, and (2) these networks exhibited robust performance even when applied to data from unknown diseases.</p>

            <h2>Joint Superimposed Pilot-aided Channel Estimation and Data Detection for FTN Signaling over Doubly-Selective Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simin Keykhosravi, Ebrahim Bedeer</p>
            <p>Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and superimposed pilot (SP) techniques are effective solutions for significantly enhancing the spectral efficiency (SE) in next-generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes an innovative SP-aided channel estimation method for FTN signaling enhancing the SE over doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To avoid complex channel tracking, we utilize a basis expansion model (BEM) to characterize doubly-selective channel variations. We propose a frame structure that superimposes a known periodic pilot sequence onto the information sequence, avoiding SE loss by eliminating the additional overhead of multiplexed pilot (MP). Additionally, we find the optimal FTN signaling SP sequence that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. Expanding on our proposed SP-aided channel estimation method, we propose two detection methods: (1) an SP-aided separate channel estimation and data detection (SCEDD) method performing a single channel estimation followed by iterative data detection via a turbo equalizer, serving as a baseline for evaluating the SP-aided channel estimation method, and (2) an SP-aided joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD) method, which extends the SCEDD by updating the channel estimate in each turbo equalization iteration, becoming our primary focus for its superior performance. At equivalent SE and a higher fading rate on the order of $10^{-3}$, our simulations show that SP-aided SCEDD method outperforms MP-aided techniques in both MSE and BER, while the SP-aided JCEDD method delivers remarkable performance, where reference approaches fail to track rapid channel variations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deep Parikh, Thomas L. Ahrens, Manoranjan Majji</p>
            <p>This paper presents a computationally efficient model predictive control formulation that uses an integral Chebyshev collocation method to enable rapid operations of autonomous agents. By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements. Finally, collaborative control scenarios involving multi-agent space systems are considered to demonstrate the technical merits of the proposed work.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum Neural Network Transfer-Learning Model for Forecasting Problems with Continuous and Discrete Variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismael Abdulrahman</p>
            <p>This study introduces simple yet effective continuous- and discrete-variable quantum neural network (QNN) models as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting tasks. The CV-QNN features a single quantum layer with two qubits to establish entanglement and utilizes a minimal set of quantum gates, including displacement, rotation, beam splitter, squeezing, and a non-Gaussian cubic-phase gate, with a maximum of eight trainable parameters. A key advantage of this model is its ability to be trained on a single dataset, after which the learned parameters can be transferred to other forecasting problems with little to no fine-tuning. Initially trained on the Kurdistan load demand dataset, the model's frozen parameters are successfully applied to various forecasting tasks, including energy consumption, traffic flow, weather conditions, and cryptocurrency price prediction, demonstrating strong performance. Furthermore, the study introduces a discrete-variable quantum model with an equivalent 2- and 4-wire configuration and presents a performance assessment, showing good but relatively lower effectiveness compared to the continuous-variable model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Jiang, Grace J. Grace, J. Webster Stayman</p>
            <p>This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Prévost, Vincent Léchappé, Romain Delpoux, Xavier Brun</p>
            <p>This article proposes a mechanical sensorless control strategy for the synchronous rectification of small wind turbines equipped with a surface-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). By means of Lyapunov theory, the Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) of the closed loop system is proven. It allows the use of a classical Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) to remove the mechanical sensor in the control loop despite uncertainties on the resistance and inductance parameters. The analysis of the equilibrium points have made it possible to propose an analytic model of the angular misalignment between the true and the observer rotating frames, responsible for current tracking errors. Experimental tests on a wind turbine emulator show that despite large errors on the the resistance and inductance parameters, the impact on the energy harvest is low, proving that the strategy's performance is robust to high uncertainties.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Net Load Forecasting for High-Penetration RES Grids Utilizing Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixiang Huang, Jianhua Pei, Luocheng Chen, Zhenchang Du, Jinfu Chen, Zirui Peng</p>
            <p>The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES) in modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and accuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erick Silva, Tadeu Freitas, Rehana Yasmin, Ali Shoker, Paulo Esteves-Verissimo</p>
            <p>A notable challenge in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is the time required to fully charge the battery, which can range from 15 minutes to 2-3 hours. This idle period, however, presents an opportunity to offer time-consuming or data-intensive services such as vehicular software updates. ISO 15118 referred to the concept of Value-Added Services (VAS) in the charging scenario, but it remained underexplored in the literature. Our paper addresses this gap by proposing \acronym, the first EV charger compute architecture that supports secure on-charger universal applications with upstream and downstream communication. The architecture covers the end-to-end hardware/software stack, including standard API for vehicles and IT infrastructure. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of \acronym by employing and evaluating three suggested value-added services: vehicular software updates, security information and event management (SIEM), and secure payments. The results demonstrate significant reductions in bandwidth utilization and latency, as well as high throughput, which supports this novel concept and suggests a promising business model for Electric Vehicle charging station operation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Cui, Ki-Hong Park, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
            <p>One of the most important technologies in the fifth generation (5G) and the sixth generation (6G) is massive multiple input multiple outputs (MIMO) or extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO). With the evolving high-frequency technologies in millimeter band or tereHz band, the communication scene is changing into near-field rather than the conventional far-field scenario. In this letter, instead of advertising the XL-MIMO in the near-field, we appeal that a limit should be set on the size of the antenna array, beyond which the channel capacity will not show a significant increase. We show capacity saturation point can be analytically determined. Moreover, we propose a new beamforming algorithm that relieve the heavy computation due to the large antenna size even around the saturation point. Numerical results are provided to validate our analysis and show the performance of our newly proposed beamforming scheme.</p>

            <p>Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4--24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40--880 m propagation distance, encompassing seven Line of Sight (LOS) and 13 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in (CI) free space PL (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The measured NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values (as computed by 3GPP methods) are found to be consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point-data tables with corresponding site-specific environmental information for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to support the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics presented here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morgan Williamson, Aditya Rao, Evan Segura, Bryson Wylie, Matthew Hall</p>
            <p>We investigate the potential of enhancing small (<20 kg) drone endurance by exploiting the high energy density of hydrocarbons using a prototype generator based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) thermoelectric energy conversion technology. A proof-of-concept prototype was developed to vet design and engineering challenges and to bolster validity of resultant conclusions. The combination of the prototype performance and modeling suggests that endurance augmentation remains a difficult technical challenge with no clear immediate remedy despite many expectant alternatives. Across a sample of representative drones including ground- and air-based, multicopter and fixed wing drones, we report the following: from their current maximum values of 12%, thermoelectric (TE) generator module efficiencies must increase by over two times to achieve endurance parity with lithium batteries for VTOL multicopters. On the other hand, current TE efficiencies can compete with lithium batteries for some low power fixed wing and ground-based drones. Technical contributors for these results include weight of non-energy contributing components, low specific power and the associated tradeoff between specific power and specific energy due to fuel mass fraction, and lastly, low efficiencies.</p>

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences)</p>
            <p>Renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems require rectifiers to supply power to electrolyzers (ELZs). Two main types of rectifiers, insulated-gate bipolar transistor rectifiers (IGBT-Rs) and thyristor rectifiers (TRs), offer distinct tradeoffs. IGBT-Rs provide flexible reactive power control but are costly, whereas TRs are more affordable with lower power loss but consume a large amount of uncontrollable reactive power. A mixed configuration of rectifiers in utility-scale ReP2H systems could achieve an decent tradeoff and increase overall profitability. To explore this potential, this paper proposes an optimal investment portfolio model. First, we model and compare the active and reactive power characteristics of ELZs powered by TRs and IGBT-Rs. Second, we consider the investment of ELZs, rectifiers, and var resources and coordinate the operation of renewables, energy storage, var resources, and the on-off switching and load allocation of multiple ELZs. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model based on weighted information gap decision theory (W-IGDT) is developed to address the uncertainties of the renewable power and hydrogen price, and we apply the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm to accelerate its solution. Case studies demonstrate that optimal rectifier configurations increase revenue by at most 2.56% compared with using only TRs or IGBT-Rs, as well as those in existing projects. Under the optimal portfolio, reactive power compensation investment is nearly eliminated, with a preferred TR-to-IGBT-R ratio of 3:1.</p>

            <p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by using electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles to provide on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized framework for conflict-free takeoff scheduling of eVTOLs in on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which jointly schedules UAM vehicles for servicing trip requests and rebalancing, subject to safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which the average waiting time transitions from being stable to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy maximizes throughput for sufficiently large fleet size and if the UAM network has a certain symmetry property. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces average passenger waiting time compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</p>

            <p>This letter studies the impact of fluid antenna system (FAS) technology on the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted multiuser communication networks. Specifically, we consider a scenario where a fixed-position antenna (FPA) base station (BS) serves K FAS-equipped users with the assistance of a UAV acting as an aerial relay. The BS employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), while the UAV operates in half-duplex (HD) mode using the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. For this system, we derive a compact analytical expression for the outage probability (OP) and its asymptotic behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, leveraging the multivariate t-distribution. Our results show how deploying FAS at ground users (GUs) in UAV-aided communications improves overall system performance compared to using FPA GUs.</p>

            <p>Vehicle cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, driven by the innovation in the automotive industry, e.g., automomous, electric, or connnected vehicles. Current efforts to address these challenges are constrained by the limited computational resources of vehicles and the reliance on connected infrastructures. This motivated the foundation of Vehicle Security Operations Centers (VSOCs) that extend IT-based Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to cover the entire automotive ecosystem, both the in-vehicle and off-vehicle scopes. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools are considered key for impelementing an effective cybersecurity solution. However, existing state-of-the-art solutions depend on infrastructure networks such as 4G, 5G, and WiFi, which often face scalability and congestion issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel SOAR architecture EVSOAR that leverages the EV charging stations for connectivity and computing to enhance vehicle cybersecurity. Our EV-specific SOAR architecture enables real-time analysis and automated responses to cybersecurity threats closer to the EV, reducing the cellular latency, bandwidth, and interference limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in latency, stability, and scalability through the infrastructure and the capacity to deploy computationally intensive applications, that are otherwise infeasible within the resource constraints of individual vehicles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burak Dindar, Can Berk Saner, Hüseyin K. Çakmak, Veit Hagenmeyer</p>
            <p>Due to the transformation of the power system, the effective use of flexibility from the distribution system (DS) is becoming crucial for efficient network management. Leveraging this flexibility requires interoperability among stakeholders, including Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). However, data privacy concerns among stakeholders present significant challenges for utilizing this flexibility effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based method in which the technical constraints of the DSs are represented by ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data. Using these models, the TSO can solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem and directly determine the dispatch of flexibility-providing units (FPUs), in our case, distributed generators (DGs), in a single round of communication. To achieve this, we introduce a novel neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to efficiently represent the feasible region of the DSs, ensuring computational effectiveness. Furthermore, we incorporate various PQ charts rather than idealized ones, demonstrating that the proposed method is adaptable to a wide range of FPU characteristics. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we benchmark it against the standard AC-OPF on multiple DSs with meshed connections and multiple points of common coupling (PCCs) with varying voltage magnitudes. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method achieves performant results while prioritizing data privacy. Additionally, since this method directly determines the dispatch of FPUs, it eliminates the need for an additional disaggregation step. By representing the DSs technical constraints through ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data, the transfer of sensitive information between stakeholders is prevented.</p>

            <p>In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge. Such an operation calls for an energy management system that decides the set points of the primary control layer in the best way possible. This has to fulfill user requirements, minimize costs, and balance local generation with energy storage. Such storage enables building flexibility. This paper presents a novel aging-aware strategy for electrified buildings. The energy management algorithm presented incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between the grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed algorithm can be used to improve grid costs or to protect the batteries (static or electric vehicles). This energy management algorithm can control different cathode chemistries as well as aged and fresh batteries, improving costs with respect to benchmarks for these cases.</p>

            <p>Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</p>

However, the different bands that can be used for ground-to-satellite communication are affected differently by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation, which introduces uncertainty on the attenuation of the communication links at high frequencies. Based on this, we present a compelling case for applying integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in heterogeneous and multi-layer LEO satellite constellations over wide areas. Specifically, we propose a sensing-assisted communications framework and frame structure that not only enables the accurate estimation of the atmospheric attenuation in the communication links through sensing but also leverages this information to determine the optimal serving satellites and allocate resources efficiently for downlink communication with users on the ground. The results show that, by dedicating an adequate amount of resources for sensing and solving the association and resource allocation problems jointly, it is feasible to increase the average throughput by 59% and the fairness by 700% when compared to solving these problems separately.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Preserving Mechanisms for Coordinating Airspace Usage in Advanced Air Mobility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chinmay Maheshwari, Maria G. Mendoza, Victoria Marie Tuck, Pan-Yang Su, Victor L. Qin, Sanjit A. Seshia, Hamsa Balakrishnan, Shankar Sastry</p>
            <p>Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations are expected to transform air transportation while challenging current air traffic management practices. By introducing a novel market-based mechanism, we address the problem of on-demand allocation of capacity-constrained airspace to AAM vehicles with heterogeneous and private valuations. We model airspace and air infrastructure as a collection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles that simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region. Vehicles request access to the airspace with trajectories spanning multiple regions at different times. We use the graph structure of our airspace model to formulate the allocation problem as a path allocation problem on a time-extended graph. To ensure the cost information of AAM vehicles remains private, we introduce a novel mechanism that allocates each vehicle a budget of "air-credits" and anonymously charges prices for traversing the edges of the time-extended graph. We seek to compute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints are satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector capacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal for each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to individual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral allocations may not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and computation of a fractional-competitive equilibrium, where allocations can be fractional. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a distributed, iterative, two-step algorithm that: 1) computes a fractional competitive equilibrium, and 2) derives an integral allocation from this equilibrium. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in allocating trajectories for two emerging urban air mobility services: drone delivery and air taxis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Poudel, Poorva Sharma, Abhineet Parchure, Daniel Olsen, Sayantan Bhowmik, Tonya Martin, Dylan Locsin, Andrew P. Reiman</p>
            <p>The uncertainty in distribution grid planning is driven by the unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</p>

            <h2>Synthesizing Grid Data with Cyber Resilience and Privacy Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengyang Wu, Vladimir Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Differential privacy (DP) provides a principled approach to synthesizing data (e.g., loads) from real-world power systems while limiting the exposure of sensitive information. However, adversaries may exploit synthetic data to calibrate cyberattacks on the source grids. To control these risks, we propose new DP algorithms for synthesizing data that provide the source grids with both cyber resilience and privacy guarantees. The algorithms incorporate both normal operation and attack optimization models to balance the fidelity of synthesized data and cyber resilience. The resulting post-processing optimization is reformulated as a robust optimization problem, which is compatible with the exponential mechanism of DP to moderate its computational burden.</p>

            <h2>The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary</p>
            <p>Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?" This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost. Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the experimental validation of a framework for the coordinated dispatch and control of multiple active distribution networks (ADNs) hosting distributed energy resource (DER). We show that the presented method, which builds further on work done in [1], effectively allows to control multiple ADNs in a distributed way to ensure they achieve a common objective without revealing information on their DERs capabilities or grid model. This experimental validation is carried out using demonstrators at the DESL of EPFL and the NEST site at Empa, both in Switzerland. The coordination of the systems to share the flexibility of their controllable assets is demonstrated through a set of 24h experiments.

            <h2>Assessment of Cyberattack Detection-Isolation Algorithm for CAV Platoons Using SUMO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy</p>
            <p>A Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon in an evolving real-world driving environment relies strongly on accurate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for its safe and efficient operation. However, a cyberattack on this communication network can corrupt the appropriate control actions, tamper with system measurement, and drive the platoon to unsafe or undesired conditions. As a first step toward practicable resilience against such V2V-V2I attacks, in this paper, we implemented a unified V2V-V2I cyberattack detection scheme and a V2I isolation scheme for a CAV platoon under changing driving conditions in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The implemented algorithm utilizes vehicle-specific residual generators that are designed based on analytical disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity performance constraints. Our case studies include two driving scenarios where highway driving is simulated using the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data and urban driving follows the benchmark EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). The results validate the applicability of the algorithm to ensure CAV cybersecurity and demonstrate the promising potential for practical test-bed implementation in the future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Nour, Mohamed H. Zaki, Mohamed Abdel-Aty</p>
            <p>Work zones play a key role in road and highway maintenance but can lead to significant risks to both drivers and workers. Smart Work Zones (SWZs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering decision-makers real-time insights into the status of the work zone. By utilizing work zone barrels equipped with sensors and communication nodes, SWZs facilitate collecting and transmitting critical data, including location, traffic density, flow patterns, and worker proximity alerts. In collaboration with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), this study addresses work zone barrel connectivity requirements while considering a cost-effective, low-power, and low-maintenance solution. While the broader project aimed to create a complete SWZ system for the localization of work zone barrels, this paper proposes a novel relay node selection algorithm integrated with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to enhance network performance. The proposed algorithm enhances the communication network performance by selecting specific nodes as relay points, avoiding message flooding in the network. It demonstrates an improvement in message delivery rates, achieving up to a 40% increase over existing methods while ensuring balanced load distribution among nodes. Moreover, it maintains an 80% message delivery rate while minimizing power consumption, outperforming other approaches. This improvement in communication efficiency is critical, as it ensures the accurate transmission and delivery of vital work zone data, allowing for faster and more informed decisions to enhance work zone safety and management.</p>

            <h2>Sensing-Based Beamformed Resource Allocation in Standalone Millimeter-Wave Vehicular Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Traspadini, Anay Ajit Deshpande, Marco Giordani, Chinmay Mahabal, Takayuki Shimizu, Michele Zorzi</p>
            <p>In 3GPP New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), the new standard for next-generation vehicular networks, vehicles can autonomously select sidelink resources for data transmission, which permits network operations without cellular coverage. However, standalone resource allocation is uncoordinated, and is complicated by the high mobility of the nodes that may introduce unforeseen channel collisions (e.g., when a transmitting vehicle changes path) or free up resources (e.g., when a vehicle moves outside of the communication area). Moreover, unscheduled resource allocation is prone to the hidden node and exposed node problems, which are particularly critical considering directional transmissions. In this paper, we implement and demonstrate a new channel access scheme for NR V2X in Frequency Range 2 (FR2), i.e., at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, based on directional and beamformed transmissions along with Sidelink Control Information (SCI) to select resources for transmission. We prove via simulation that this approach can reduce the probability of collision for resource allocation, compared to a baseline solution that does not configure SCI transmissions.</p>

            <h2>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</p>

            <p>Channel prediction permits to acquire channel state information (CSI) without signaling overhead. However, almost all existing channel prediction methods necessitate the deployment of a dedicated model to accommodate a specific configuration. Leveraging the powerful modeling and multi-task learning capabilities of foundation models, we propose the first space-time-frequency (STF) wireless foundation model (WiFo) to address time-frequency channel prediction tasks in a one-for-all manner. Specifically, WiFo is initially pre-trained over massive and extensive diverse CSI datasets. Then, the model will be instantly used for channel prediction under various CSI configurations without any fine-tuning. We propose a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based network structure for WiFo to handle heterogeneous STF CSI data, and design several mask reconstruction tasks for self-supervised pre-training to capture the inherent 3D variations of CSI. To fully unleash its predictive power, we build a large-scale heterogeneous simulated CSI dataset consisting of 160K CSI samples for pre-training. Simulations validate its superior unified learning performance across multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot generalization performance via comparisons with other full-shot baselines.</p>

            <h2>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonçalo Hora de Carvalho</p>
            <p>Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Noever, Forrest McKee</p>
            <p>The paper presents a novel technique for encoding dual messages within standard Quick Response (QR) codes through precise half-pixel module splitting. This work challenges fundamental assumptions about deterministic decoding in the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard while maintaining complete compatibility with existing QR infrastructure. The proposed two-dimensional barcode attack enables angle-dependent message selection while maintaining compatibility with unmodified QR readers and the 100 million US mobile users who use their phone's built-in scanners. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested codes, watermarking, or error correction exploitation, our method achieves true one-to-many mapping by manipulating the physical sampling process built into the QR standard. By preserving critical function patterns while bifurcating data modules, we create automated codes that produce different but valid readings based on camera viewing angle. Experimental results demonstrate successful implementation across multiple use cases, including simple message text pairs, complex URLs (this http URL), and security test patterns for malware and spam detectors (EICAR/GTUBE). Our technique achieves reliable dual-message decoding using standard QR readers at module scales of 9-11 pixels, with successful angle-dependent reading demonstrated across vertical, horizontal, and diagonal orientations. The method's success suggests potential applications beyond QR code phishing ('quishing') including two-factor authentication, anti-counterfeiting, and information density optimization. The half-pixel technique may offer future avenues for similar implementations in other 2D barcode formats such as Data Matrix and Aztec Code.</p>

            <p>With the Internet of Things (IoT) fostering seamless device-to-human and device-to-device interactions, the domain of intelligent lighting systems have evolved beyond simple occupancy and daylight sensing towards autonomous monitoring and control of power consumption and illuminance levels. To this regard, this paper proposes a new do-it-yourself (DIY) IoT-based method of smart lighting system featuring an illuminance control algorithm. The design involves the integration of occupancy and presence sensors alongside a communication module, to enable real-time wireless interaction and remote monitoring of the system parameters from any location through an end-user application. A constrained optimization problem was formulated to determine the optimal dimming vector for achieving target illuminance at minimal power consumption. The simplex algorithm was used to solve this problem, and the system's performance was validated through both MATLAB simulations and real-world prototype testing in an indoor office environment. The obtained experimental results demonstrate substantial power savings across multiple user occupancy scenarios, achieving reductions of approx. 80%, 48%, and 26% for one, two, and four user settings, respectively, in comparison to traditional basic lighting installation systems.</p>

            <p>Accurate wind speed prediction is crucial for designing and selecting sites for offshore wind farms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting offshore wind power for a site near the Gulf of Mexico by analyzing meteorological data. After collecting and preprocessing meteorological data, nine different input feature combinations were designed to assess their impact on wind power predictions at multiple heights. The results show that using wind speed as the output feature improves prediction accuracy by approximately 10% compared to using wind power as the output. In addition, the improvement of multi-feature input compared with single-feature input is not obvious mainly due to the poor correlation among key features and limited generalization ability of models. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate output features and highlight considerations for using machine learning in wind power forecasting, offering insights that could guide future wind power prediction models and conversion techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony D. Stephens, David R. Walwyn</p>
            <p>In 2024, the UK Government made two striking announcements on its plans to decarbonise the energy system; it pledged GBP22 billion to establish carbon capture and storage hubs on Teesside and Merseyside and released the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. This paper questions the validity of both plans, arguing that they do not take adequate account of the consequences of the highly variable nature of wind and solar generations. Using dynamic models of future UK electricity systems which are designed to take account of these variabilities, it is shown that the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan overestimates the ability of wind and solar generations to decarbonise the electricity system as they increase in size relative to the demand of the electricity system. More importantly, the dynamic models show that most of the achievable decarbonization is the result of increasing wind generation from the current level of around 10 GW to around 20 GW. Increasing wind generation to only 20 GW, rather than to 30 GW as proposed in the Action Plan, should halve the proposed cost, a saving of perhaps GBP 120 billion, with little disbenefit in terms of reduced decarbonization. Furthermore, the dynamic modelling shows that UK gas storage capacity of 7.5 winter days looks hopeless inadequate in comparison with the storage capacities deemed necessary by its continental neighbors. Concern is expressed that a consequence of the Climate Change Act of 2008 requiring the UK to meet arbitrary decarbonization targets is leading government advisors to propose several unproven and therefore highly risky technological solutions.</p>

            <p>The energy sector's digital transformation brings mutually dependent communication and energy infrastructure, tightening the relationship between the physical and the digital world. Digital twins (DT) are the key concept for this. This paper initially discusses the evolution of the DT concept across various engineering applications before narrowing its focus to the power systems domain. By reviewing different definitions and applications, the authors present a new definition of DTs specifically tailored to power systems. Based on the proposed definition and extensive deliberations and consultations with distribution system operators, energy traders, and municipalities, the authors introduce a vision of a standard DT ecosystem architecture that offers services beyond real-time updates and can seamlessly integrate with existing transmission and distribution system operators' processes while reconciling with concepts such as microgrids and local energy communities based on a system-of-systems view. The authors also discuss their vision related to the integration of power system DTs into various phases of the system's life cycle, such as long-term planning, emphasising challenges that remain to be addressed, such as managing measurement and model errors, and uncertainty propagation. Finally, the authors present their vision of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can enhance several power systems DT modules established in the proposed architecture.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless communications networks. Its integration with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques promises to leverage substantial spatial beamforming gains for both functionalities. In this work, we consider a massive MIMO-ISAC system employing a uniform planar array with zero-forcing and maximum-ratio downlink transmission schemes combined with monostatic radar-type sensing. Our focus lies on deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communications rate and the Cramér--Rao lower bound (CRLB), which serve as performance metrics for communications and sensing operations, respectively. The expressions enable us to investigate important operational characteristics of massive MIMO-ISAC, including the mutual effects of communications and sensing as well as the advantages stemming from using a very large antenna array for each functionality. Furthermore, we devise a power allocation strategy based on successive convex approximation to maximize the communications rate while guaranteeing the CRLB constraints and transmit power budget. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed power allocation approach.</p>

Technological advancements in energy density and battery pack capacities are poised to take electric vehicle ranges over 1000 km from a single charge. This study also examines developments in artificial intelligence-improved battery management systems, enhanced safety, mechanical integrity, reliability, diagnostics, and practical considerations. Furthermore, future developments, such as the incorporation of batteries in aviation and other new uses, are investigated to provide insight into the future generation of economically viable, secure, and high-performance battery systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao</p>
            <p>This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</p>

            <h2>Balancing SoC in Battery Cells using Safe Action Perturbations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E Harshith Kumar Yadav, Rahul Narava, Anshika, Shashi Shekher Jha</p>
            <p>Managing equal charge levels in active cell balancing while charging a Li-ion battery is challenging. An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.</p>

            <h2>Robust Model Predictive Control of Fast Lithium-ion Battery Pretreatment for Safe Recycling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Yuan, Adam Burman, Changfu Zou</p>
            <p>The proper disposal and repurposing of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries are critical for maximizing their environmental benefits. This study introduces a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to optimize the battery discharging process during pre-treatment, ensuring both efficiency and safety. The proposed method explicitly incorporates temperature constraints to prevent overheating and potential hazards. By leveraging a control-oriented equivalent circuit model integrated with thermal dynamics, the MPC algorithm dynamically adjusts the discharging profile to maintain safe operating temperatures. Additionally, the robust controller is designed to account for model mismatches between the nonlinear battery dynamics and the linearized model, ensuring reliable performance under varying conditions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through simulations comparing the robust MPC method with conventional discharging strategies, including constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) and constant current-constant temperature (CC-CT) methods. Results indicate that the robust MPC framework significantly reduces discharging time while adhering to safety constraints, offering a promising solution for the recycling and second-life applications of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

            <h2>Exergy Battery Modeling and P2P Trading Based Optimal Operation of Virtual Energy Station</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Song, Xinyi Jing, Jianyong Ding, Ciwei Gao, Mingyu Yan, Wensheng Luo, Mariusz Malinowski</p>
            <p>Virtual energy stations (VESs) work as retailers to provide electricity and natural gas sale services for integrated energy systems (IESs), and guide IESs energy consumption behaviors to tackle the varying market prices via integrated demand response (IDR). However, IES customers are risk averse and show low enthusiasm in responding to the IDR incentive signals. To address this problem, exergy is utilized to unify different energies and allowed to be virtually stored and withdrawn for arbitrage by IESs. The whole incentive mechanism operating process is innovatively characterized by a virtual exergy battery. Peer to peer (P2P) exergy trading based on shared exergy storage is also developed to reduce the energy cost of IESs without any extra transmission fee. In this way, IES can reduce the economic loss risk caused by the market price fluctuation via the different time (time dimension), multiple energy conversion (energy dimension), and P2P exergy trading (space dimension) arbitrage. Moreover, the optimal scheduling of VES and IESs is modeled by a bilevel optimization model. The consensus based alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this problem in a distributed way. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism and show that the shared exergy storage can enhance the benefits of different type IESs by 18.96%, 3.49%, and 3.15 %, respectively.</p>

            <h2>A Profit Sharing Mechanism for Coordinated Power Traffic System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Sima, Mingyu Yan, Jianfeng Wen, Wensheng Luo, Mariusz Malinowski</p>
            <p>During the scheduling process, the traffic network operator (TNO) and the distribution network operator (DNO) act noncooperatively. Under the TNO management, the distribution of charging loads may exacerbate the local supply demand imbalance in the power distribution network (PDN), which negatively impacts the economic operation of the PDN. This paper proposes a profitsharing mechanism based on the principle of incentive compatibility for coordinating the traffic network (TN) and the PDN to minimize the operation cost of PDN. Under this mechanism, the scheduling process of the power traffic system is divided into two stages. At the prescheduling stage, the TNO allocates traffic flow and charging loads without considering the operation of the PDN, after which the DNO schedules and obtains the original cost. At the rescheduling stage, the DNO shares part of benefits of the optimal operation to the TNO to redispatch the EV charging to obtain a more effective charging plan, thus minimize the overall cost of PDN. Then, a bilevel model is developed to simulate the operation of the power traffic system with the proposed sharing scheme and identify the best sharing ratio. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the PDN can achieve the minimum total cost and simultaneously the TN can also benefit from the proposed profit sharing mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Fast Critical Clearing Time Calculation for Power Systems with Synchronous and Asynchronous Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuezao Wang, Yijun Xu, Wei Gu, Kai Liu, Shuai Lu, Mert Korkali, Lamine Mili</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewables is replacing traditional synchronous generation in modern power systems with low-inertia asynchronous converter-interfaced generators (CIGs). This penetration threatens the dynamic stability of the modern power system. To assess the latter, we resort to the critical clearing time (CCT) as a stability index, which is typically computed through a large number of time-domain simulations. This is especially true for CIG-embedded power systems, where the complexity of the model is further increased. To alleviate the computing burden, we developed a trajectory sensitivity-based method for assessing the CCT in power systems with synchronous and asynchronous generators. This allows us to obtain the CCT cost-effectively. The simulation results reveal the excellent performance of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaqi Wu, Jingyi Yuan, Yang Weng, Guangwen Wang</p>
            <p>Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network (NN) parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of NN, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.</p>

            <h2>Robust Co-Optimization of Distribution Network Hardening and Mobile Resource Scheduling with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donglai Ma, Xiaoyu Cao, Bo Zeng, Chen Chen, Qiaozhu Zhai, Qing-Shan Jia, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>This paper studies the robust co-planning of proactive network hardening and mobile hydrogen energy resources (MHERs) scheduling, which is to enhance the resilience of power distribution network (PDN) against the disastrous events. A decision-dependent robust optimization model is formulated with min-max resilience constraint and discrete recourse structure, which helps achieve the load survivability target considering endogenous uncertainties. Different from the traditional model with a fixed uncertainty set, we adopt a dynamic representation that explicitly captures the endogenous uncertainties of network contingency as well as the available hydrogen storage levels of MHERs, which induces a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Also, the multi-period adaptive routing and energy scheduling of MHERs are modeled as a mixed-integer recourse problem for further decreasing the resilience cost. Then, a nested parametric column-and-constraint generation (N-PC&CG) algorithm is customized and developed to solve this challenging formulation. By leveraging the structural property of the DDU set as well as the combination of discrete recourse decisions and the corresponding extreme points, we derive a strengthened solution scheme with nontrivial enhancement strategies to realize efficient and exact computation. Numerical results on 14-bus test system and 56-bus real-world distribution network demonstrate the resilience benefits and economical feasibility of the proposed method under different damage severity levels. Moreover, the enhanced N-PC&CG shows a superior solution capability to support prompt decisions for resilient planning with DDU models.</p>

            <h2>Robust Full-Space Physical Layer Security for STAR-RIS-Aided Wireless Networks: Eavesdropper with Uncertain Location and Channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Xiao, Xiaoyan Hu, Ang Li, Wenjie Wang, Kun Yang</p>
            <p>A robust full-space physical layer security (PLS) transmission scheme is proposed in this paper considering the full-space wiretapping challenge of wireless networks supported by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Different from the existing schemes, the proposed PLS scheme takes account of the uncertainty on the eavesdropper's position within the 360$^\circ$ service area offered by the STAR-RIS. Specifically, the large system analytical method is utilized to derive the asymptotic expression of the average security rate achieved by the security user, considering that the base station (BS) only has the statistical information of the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and the uncertainty of its location. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLS scheme, we first formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted sum rate of the security user and the public user. This optimization is conducted under the power allocation constraint, and some practical limitations for STAR-RIS implementation, through jointly designing the active and passive beamforming variables. A novel iterative algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and cross-entropy optimization (CEO) methods is proposed to effectively address the established non-convex optimization problem with discrete variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed robust PLS scheme can effectively mitigate the information leakage across the entire coverage area of the STAR-RIS-assisted system, leading to superior performance gain when compared to benchmark schemes encompassing traditional RIS-aided scheme.</p>

            <p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</p>

            <h2>Degradation-Aware Microgrid Optimal Planning: Integrating Dynamic Energy Efficiencies and Second-Life Battery Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Zahid Butt, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Traditional microgrid planning often overlooks PV and BESS degradation or relies on complex, downscaled models, leading to unreliable, costly and suboptimal investment decisions. This paper presents a degradation-based investment optimization (DBIO) methodology for long-term microgrid planning. The model optimally sizes and schedules PV, BESS, and controllable distributed energy resources, while considering technical, financial, and degradation characteristics. We first developed a cumulative multi-year optimization model as a benchmark, excluding BESS efficiency fade and capacity degradation that would be captured in the next step, to ensure convergence. Subsequently, a yearly validation model was iteratively solved for each year in the planning horizon, updating energy efficiencies of PV and BESS, along with BESS capacity, based on annual degradation, ensuring the reliability of initial solution. An iterative refinement process further adjusts BESS capacity to eliminate load shedding while minimizing costs. Sensitivity analyses on PV efficiency degradation rates, second-life battery (SLB) capital cost, and grid tariffs further explore their economic implications. Results show that degradation significantly impacts resource allocation, with ignored degradation risking reliability, potential load shedding, and blackout costs, while SLBs provide cost-saving opportunities. The DBIO framework offers a computationally efficient and scalable solution for microgrid planning, with broader applications in grid-scale asset management.</p>

            <h2>A Weighted Predict-and-Optimize Framework for Power System Operation Considering Varying Impacts of Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingrui Zhuang, Lin Cheng, Can Wan, Rui Xie, Ning Qi, Yue Chen</p>
            <p>Integrating prediction and optimization enhances decision-making quality by yielding near optimal solutions. Given that prediction errors associated with multiple uncertainties have varying impacts on downstream decision-making, improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative importance of each uncertainty for specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of weighted predictions for downstream optimization as compared to perfect predictions. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, WPO framework enables adaptive uncertainty impact assessment and integrated learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we construct a surrogate model to establish the mapping between weights and PDPL, where multi-task learning and enhanced graph convolutional networks are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms traditional methods by achieving a much smaller PDPL within acceptable computational time.</p>

            <h2>Inverter Control with Time-Varying and Nonconvex State and Input Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixiao Ma, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>The growing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into modern power systems poses significant challenges for maintaining reliable operation under dynamic and constrained conditions. This paper focuses on the power tracking problem for grid-connected IBRs, addressing the complexities introduced by voltage and power factor constraints. Voltage constraints, being time-varying and nonlinear input constraints, often conflict with power factor constraints, which are state constraints. These conflicts, coupled with stability requirements, add substantial complexity to control design. To overcome these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient static state-feedback controller that guarantees stability and satisfies operational constraints. The concept of achievability is introduced to evaluate whether power setpoints can be accurately tracked while adhering to all constraints. Using a parameterization framework and the S-lemma, we develop criteria to assess and maximize the continuous achievable region for IBR operation. This framework allows system operators to ensure safety and stability by precomputing a finite set of control gains, significantly reducing online computational requirements. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling time-varying grid disturbances and achieving reliable control performance.</p>

            <p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-agent Systems via CBF-inspired Risk Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Siwon Jo, Yupeng Yang, Wenhao Luo</p>
            <p>Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock -- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyang Huang, Yang Liu, Kai Sun, Feng Qiu</p>
            <p>Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.</p>

            <h2>Analysis and Mitigation of Cascading Failures Using a Stochastic Interaction Graph with Eigen-analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenping Guo, Xiaowen Su, Kai Sun, Byungkwon Park, Srdjan Simunovic</p>
            <p>In studies on complex network systems using graph theory, eigen-analysis is typically performed on an undirected graph model of the network. However, when analyzing cascading failures in a power system, the interactions among failures suggest the need for a directed graph beyond the topology of the power system to model directions of failure propagation. To accurately quantify failure interactions for effective mitigation strategies, this paper proposes a stochastic interaction graph model and associated eigen-analysis. Different types of modes on failure propagations are defined and characterized by the eigenvalues of a stochastic interaction matrix, whose absolute values are unity, zero, or in between. Finding and interpreting these modes helps identify the probable patterns of failure propagation, either local or widespread, and the participating components based on eigenvectors. Then, by lowering the failure probabilities of critical components highly participating in a mode of widespread failures, cascading can be mitigated. The validity of the proposed stochastic interaction graph model, eigen-analysis and the resulting mitigation strategies is demonstrated using simulated cascading failure data on an NPCC 140-bus system.</p>

            <h2>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Design for IRS-aided MIMO ISAC Based on Sensing Mutual Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Li, Gui Zhou, Tantao Gong, Nan Liu, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler, Steven Low</p>
            <p>We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an optimization framework for Formula 1 racing that integrates multi-agent interactions, aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management. By employing game-theoretic methods, we formulate the minimum lap time problem as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game. Exploiting their structural similarities, we compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics and strategic dominance. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of jointly optimizing physical interactions, energy management, and trajectory, highlighting their strong interdependence. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals characteristic strategic behaviors observed in real-world racing. The proposed methodology contributes towards realistic Formula 1 race strategy optimizations, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Zhao, Umar Salman, Zongjie Wang</p>
            <p>This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment model for power distribution networks with a focus on the influence of climate conditions and vegetation management on outage risks. Using a dataset comprising outage records, meteorological indicators, and vegetation metrics, this paper develops a logistic regression model that outperformed several alternatives, effectively identifying risk factors in highly imbalanced data. Key features impacting outages include wind speed, vegetation density, quantified as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and snow type, with wet snow and autumn conditions exhibiting the strongest positive effects. The analysis also shows complex interactions, such as the combined effect of wind speed and EVI, suggesting that vegetation density can moderate the impact of high winds on outages. Simulation case studies, based on a test dataset of 618 samples, demonstrated that the model achieved an 80\% match rate with real-world data within an error tolerance of \(\pm 0.05\), showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model while highlighting its potential to inform preventive strategies for mitigating outage risks in power distribution networks under high-risk environmental conditions. Future work will integrate vegetation height data from Lidar and explore alternative modeling approaches to capture potential non-linear relationships.</p>

            <h2>Context-aware Constrained Reinforcement Learning Based Energy-Efficient Power Scheduling for Non-stationary XR Data Traffic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kexuan Wang, An Liu</p>
            <p>In XR downlink transmission, energy-efficient power scheduling (EEPS) is essential for conserving power resource while delivering large data packets within hard-latency constraints. Traditional constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithms show promise in EEPS but still struggle with non-convex stochastic constraints, non-stationary data traffic, and sparse delayed packet dropout feedback (rewards) in XR. To overcome these challenges, this paper models the EEPS in XR as a dynamic parameter-constrained Markov decision process (DP-CMDP) with a varying transition function linked to the non-stationary data traffic and solves it by a proposed context-aware constrained reinforcement learning (CACRL) algorithm, which consists of a context inference (CI) module and a CRL module. The CI module trains an encoder and multiple potential networks to characterize the current transition function and reshape the packet dropout rewards according to the context, transforming the original DP-CMDP into a general CMDP with immediate dense rewards. The CRL module employs a policy network to make EEPS decisions under this CMDP and optimizes the policy using a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method, which is better suited for non-convex stochastic constraints. Finally, theoretical analyses provide deep insights into the CADAC algorithm, while extensive simulations demonstrate that it outperforms advanced baselines in both power conservation and satisfying packet dropout constraints.</p>

            <h2>Optimal ISAC Beamforming Structure and Efficient Algorithms for Sum Rate and CRLB Balancing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Fang, Mengyuan Ma, Markku Juntti, Nir Shlezinger, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Nhan Thanh Nguyen</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to unify wireless communications and radar sensing, enabling efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. A core challenge with realizing the gains of ISAC stems from the unique challenges of dual purpose beamforming design due to the highly non-convex nature of key performance metrics such as sum rate for communications and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity structured approach to ISAC beamforming optimization to simultaneously enhance spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm which transforms the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex subproblems ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed SCA framework and the Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal beamforming structure for CRLB optimization in ISAC systems. Our findings characterize the reduction in radar streams one can employ without affecting performance. This enables a dimensionality reduction that enhances computational efficiency. Numerical simulations validate that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance to the considered benchmarks while requiring much lower computational costs.</p>

            <p>Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Eichelbeck, Hannah Markgraf, Matthias Althoff</p>
            <p>The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Mughees, Yuzhuo Li, Yize Chen, Yunwei Ryan Li</p>
            <p>Recent research shows large-scale AI-centric data centers could experience rapid fluctuations in power demand due to varying computation loads, such as sudden spikes from inference or interruption of training large language models (LLMs). As a consequence, such huge and fluctuating power demand pose significant challenges to both data center and power utility operation. Accurate short-term power forecasting allows data centers and utilities to dynamically allocate resources and power large computing clusters as required. However, due to the complex data center power usage patterns and the black-box nature of the underlying AI algorithms running in data centers, explicit modeling of AI-data center is quite challenging. Alternatively, to deal with this emerging load forecasting problem, we propose a data-driven workflow to model and predict the short-term electricity load in an AI-data center, and such workflow is compatible with learning-based algorithms such as LSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN. We validate our framework, which achieves decent accuracy on data center GPU short-term power consumption. This provides opportunity for improved power management and sustainable data center operations.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Integration of Grid Edge Resources into Wholesale Electricity Markets via Mean-field Games</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Feng, Andrew L. Liu</p>
            <p>Grid edge resources refer to distributed energy resources (DERs) located on the consumer side of the electrical grid, controlled by consumers rather than utility companies. Integrating DERs with real-time electricity pricing can better align distributed supply with system demand, improving grid efficiency and reliability. However, DER owners, known as prosumers, often lack the expertise and resources to directly participate in wholesale energy markets, limiting their ability to fully realize the economic potential of their assets. Meanwhile, as DER adoption grows, the number of prosumers participating in the energy system is expected to increase significantly, creating additional challenges in coordination and market participation. To address these challenges, we propose a mean-field game framework that enables prosumers to autonomously learn optimal decision policies based on dynamic market prices and their variable solar generation. Our framework is designed to accommodate heterogeneous agents and demonstrates the existence of a mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in a wholesale energy market with many prosumers. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm that automates prosumers' resource control, facilitating real-time decision-making for energy storage management. Numerical experiments suggest that our approach converges towards an MFE and effectively reduces peak loads and price volatility, especially during periods of external demand or supply shocks. This study highlights the potential of a fully decentralized approach to integrating DERs into wholesale markets while improving market efficiency.</p>

            <p>This study presents an integrated energy management strategy for cost optimization in multi-energy community microgrids (MGs). The proposed approach combines storage-based peak shaving, economic dispatch of diesel generators, and efficient utilization of renewable energy sources to enhance energy management in community MGs. The efficacy of the energy management system (EMS) was validated through a simulation case study for a rural Australian community. The results demonstrate that the proposed EMS effectively reduces the peak energy demand by up to 43%, lowers operational costs by 84.63% (from $189,939/year to $29,188/year), and achieves a renewable energy utilization of 92.3%, up from 47.8% in the base system. Furthermore, the levelized cost of energy was reduced by 14.21% to $0.163/kWh. The strategy ensures an uninterrupted power supply during grid outages by utilizing DGs and battery energy storage systems. The environmental benefits included a 196.4% reduction in CO2 emissions and 100% reductions in CO, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. These findings validate the feasibility of the proposed EMS in achieving cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable energy management in community MGs. These findings contribute to the field by introducing a novel approach and demonstrating the practical feasibility of multi-energy MGs.</p>

            <p>The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify the optimal design for each option. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the evolution of the Finnish electric energy system up to 2035, focusing on the likelihood of different development paths. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of an extensive Bayesian Network, designed to model and analyse the evolution of power generation capacity mix, assess the likelihood of different grid management scenarios, and understand the causal relationships underlying these scenarios. A target optimisation was carried out using the constructed Bayesian Network to explore possibilities to minimise grid management complexity. The results of the optimisation reveal that the authorities and stakeholders should prioritise increasing demand response, gas power, and battery storage capacities. These mature technologies are well-suited to guarantee energy adequacy during peak consumption periods, which in Finland typically occur during consecutive cold, dark and windless winter weeks. Although this study focuses on the evolution of the Finnish power grid, the constructed Bayesian Network approach is broadly applicable and can be utilised to explore causal relationships in other countries by employing the designed questionnaire and engaging a panel of experts specific to the country's energy infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Assessing Electricity Network Capacity Requirements for Industrial Decarbonisation in Great Britain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Gailani, Peter Taylor</p>
            <p>Decarbonising the industrial sector is vital to reach net zero targets. The deployment of industrial decarbonisation technologies is expected to increase industrial electricity demand in many countries and this may require upgrades to the existing electricity network or new network investment. While the infrastructure requirements to support the introduction of new fuels and technologies in industry, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage are often discussed, the need for investment to increase the capacity of the electricity network to meet increasing industrial electricity demands is often overlooked in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying the requirements for additional electricity network capacity to support the decarbonisation of industrial sectors across Great Britain (GB). The Net Zero Industrial Pathways model is used to predict the future electricity demand from industrial sites to 2050 which is then compared spatially to the available headroom across the distribution network in GB. The results show that network headroom is sufficient to meet extra capacity demands from industrial sites over the period to 2030 in nearly all GB regions and network scenarios. However, as electricity demand rises due to increased electrification across all sectors and industrial decarbonisation accelerates towards 2050, the network will need significant new capacity (71 GW + by 2050) particularly in the central, south, and north-west regions of England, and Wales. Without solving these network constraints, around 65% of industrial sites that are large point sources of emissions would be constrained in terms of electric capacity by 2040. These sites are responsible for 69% of industrial point source emissions.</p>

            <p>The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
            <p>Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) refer to those attacks on power grids by disturbing/cutting off physical transmission lines and meanwhile blocking transmission of measurement data to dwarf or delay the system protection and recovery actions. Such fierce hostile attacks impose critical threats to the modern power grids when there is a fusion of power grids and telecommunication technologies. In this paper, we investigate the fault diagnosis problem of faulty transmission lines under a broader spectrum of PCPA for a linearized (or DC) power flow model. The physical attack mechanism of PCPA includes not only disconnection but also admittance value modification on transmission lines, for example, by invading distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To tackle the problem, we first recover the information of voltage phase angles within the attacked area. Using the information of voltage phase angle and power injection of buses, a graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL) algorithm is proposed to find the locations of the physical attacks. By capitalizing on the feature extraction capability of the GAT on graph data, the fault localization algorithm outperforms the existing results when under cyber attacks, e.g., denial of service (DoS) attacks. A line state identification algorithm is then developed to identify the states of the transmission lines within the attacked area. Specifically, the algorithm restores the power injection of buses within the attacked area and then identities the state of all the transmission lines within the attacked area by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Experimental simulations are effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu</p>
            <p>Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a method for load balancing and dynamic pricing in electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance network performance. The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Model Based Probabilistic Day-ahead Load Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Lin, Han Guo, Jianhui Wang</p>
            <p>Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.</p>

            <h2>Physically Large Apertures for Wireless Power Transfer: Performance and Regulatory Aspects</h2>

            <p>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising service for the Internet of Things, providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution to deploy so-called energy-neutral devices on a massive scale. The power received at the device side decays rapidly with the distance from a conventional transmit antenna with a physically small aperture. New opportunities arise from the transition from conventional far-field beamforming to near-field beam focusing. We argue that a "physically large" aperture, i.e., large w.r.t. the distance to the receiver, enables a power budget that remains practically independent of distance. Distance-dependent array gain patterns allow focusing the power density maximum precisely at the device location, while reducing the power density near the infrastructure. The physical aperture size is a key resource in enabling efficient yet regulatory-compliant WPT. We use real-world measurements to demonstrate that a regulatory-compliant system operating at sub-10GHz frequencies can increase the power received at the device into the milliwatt range. Our empirical demonstration shows that power-optimal near-field beam focusing inherently exploits multipath propagation, yielding both increased WPT efficiency and improved human exposure safety in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p>Accurately visualizing and editing tumor progression in medical imaging is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical communication. To address the challenges of subjectivity and limited precision in existing methods, we propose SkEditTumor, a sketch-based diffusion model for controllable tumor progression editing. By leveraging sketches as structural priors, our method enables precise modifications of tumor regions while maintaining structural integrity and visual realism. We evaluate SkEditTumor on four public datasets - BraTS, LiTS, KiTS, and MSD-Pancreas - covering diverse organs and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior image fidelity and segmentation accuracy. Our contributions include a novel integration of sketches with diffusion models for medical image editing, fine-grained control over tumor progression visualization, and extensive validation across multiple datasets, setting a new benchmark in the field.</p>

            <p>With increased global warming, there has been a significant emphasis to replace fossil fuel-dependent energy sources with clean, renewable sources. These new-age energy systems are becoming more complex with an increasing proportion of renewable energy sources (like solar and wind), energy storage systems (like batteries), and demand side control in the mix. Most new-age sources being highly dependent on weather and climate conditions bring about high variability and uncertainty. Energy operators rely on such uncertain data to make different planning and operations decisions periodically, and sometimes in real-time, to maintain the grid stability and optimize their objectives (cost savings, carbon footprint, etc.). Hitherto, operators mostly rely on domain knowledge, heuristics, or solve point problems to take decisions. These approaches fall short because of their specific assumptions and limitations. Further, there is a lack of a unified framework for both research and production environments at scale. In this paper, we propose EnCortex to address these challenges. EnCortex provides a general, easy-to-use, extensible, and scalable energy decision framework that enables operators to plan, build and execute their real-world scenarios efficiently. We show that using EnCortex, we can define and compose complex new-age scenarios, owing to industry-standard abstractions of energy entities and the modularity of the framework. EnCortex provides a foundational structure to support several state-of-the-art optimizers with minimal effort. EnCortex supports both quick developments for research prototypes and scaling the solutions to production environments. We demonstrate the utility of EnCortex with three complex new-age real-world scenarios and show that significant cost and carbon footprint savings can be achieved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongqi Deng, Yuan Wang, Jian Huang, Hui Zhang, Yaonan Wang</p>
            <p>The paper proposes a novel Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to simultaneously address path following accuracy and energy constraints under environmental disturbances. By formulating lateral deviations as energy-equivalent penalties in the cost function, our method enables explicit trade-offs between tracking precision and energy consumption. Furthermore, a motion-dependent decomposition technique is proposed to estimate terminal energy costs based on vehicle dynamics. Compared with the existing EMPC method, simulations with real-world ocean disturbance data demonstrate the controller's energy consumption with a 0.06 energy increase while reducing cross-track errors by up to 18.61. Field experiments conducted on an ASV equipped with an Intel N100 CPU in natural lake environments validate practical feasibility, achieving 0.22 m average cross-track error at nearly 1 m/s and 10 Hz control frequency. The proposed scheme provides a computationally tractable solution for ASVs operating under resource constraints.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces the concept of wireless-powered zero-energy reconfigurable intelligent surface (zeRIS), and investigates a wireless-powered zeRIS aided communication system in terms of security, reliability and energy efficiency. In particular, we propose three new wireless-powered zeRIS modes: 1) in mode-I, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of information user to maximize the reliability of the system; 2) in mode-II, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of cooperative jamming user to maximize the security of the system; 3) in mode-III, N1 and N2 (N1+N2=N) reconfigurable reflecting elements are respectively adjusted to the optimal phase shift designs of information user and cooperative jamming user to balance the reliability and security of the system. Then, we propose three new metrics, i.e., joint outage probability (JOP), joint intercept probability (JIP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), and analyze their closed-form expressions in three modes, respectively. The results show that under high transmission power, all the diversity gains of three modes are 1, and the JOPs of mode-I, mode-II and mode-III are improved by increasing the number of zeRIS elements, which are related to N2, N, and N^2_1, respectively. In addition, mode-I achieves the best JOP, while mode-II achieves the best JIP among three modes. We exploit two security-reliability trade-off (SRT) metrics, i.e., JOP versus JIP, and normalized joint intercept and outage probability (JIOP), to reveal the SRT performance of the proposed three modes. It is obtained that mode-II outperforms the other two modes in the JOP versus JIP, while mode-III and mode-II achieve the best performance of normalized JIOP at low and high transmission power, respectively.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of amplitude-unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</p>

            <p>Industrial pumps are essential components in various sectors, such as manufacturing, energy production, and water treatment, where their failures can cause significant financial and safety risks. Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanyu Cao, Takuya Maekawa, Kazuya Ohara, Yasue Kishino</p>
            <p>This study proposes a new deep learning method for reconstructing depth images of moving objects within a specific area using Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). The Wi-Fi-based depth imaging technique has novel applications in domains such as security and elder care. However, reconstructing depth images from CSI is challenging because learning the mapping function between CSI and depth images, both of which are high-dimensional data, is particularly difficult. To address the challenge, we propose a new approach called Wi-Depth. The main idea behind the design of Wi-Depth is that a depth image of a moving object can be decomposed into three core components: the shape, depth, and position of the target. Therefore, in the depth-image reconstruction task, Wi-Depth simultaneously estimates the three core pieces of information as auxiliary tasks in our proposed VAE-based teacher-student architecture, enabling it to output images with the consistency of a correct shape, depth, and position. In addition, the design of Wi-Depth is based on our idea that this decomposition efficiently takes advantage of the fact that shape, depth, and position relate to primitive information inferred from CSI such as angle-of-arrival, time-of-flight, and Doppler frequency shift.</p>

            <p>Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic ButterflThis paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) that integrates a compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing-abdomen motion. Drawing inspiration from the natural f light dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.</p>

            <p>In this work, image analysis techniques used in astrophysics to detect low-contrast signals have been adapted in the processing of Computed Tomography (CT) images, combining Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) and machine learning techniques. Several CT acquisitions were performed using a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different diameters producing objects with different contrasts respect to background. The images of the phantom, tilted by a known angle with respect to the tomograph axis (to mimic the casual orientation of a clinical lesion), were acquired at various radiation doses (CTDIvol) and at different slice's thicknesses. The success in detecting the signal in the single image (slice) was always greater than 60%. The axis of each insert has always been correctly identified. A super-resolution 2D image was then generated by projecting the individual slices of the scan along this axis, thus increasing the CNR of the object scanned as a whole. CVT holds great promise for future use in medical imaging, for the identification of low-contrast lesions in homogeneous organs, such as the liver.</p>

            <p>With transformer-based models and the pretrain-finetune paradigm becoming mainstream, the high storage and deployment costs of individual finetuned models on multiple tasks pose critical challenges. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights). However, existing methods usually face problems including data accessibility and training requirements. To tackle this issue, we introduce Delta-DCT, the first data-free delta compression method inspired by classic JPEG image compression, leveraging the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We first (a) group delta parameters within a layer into patches. Then we (b) assess the importance of each patch and allocate them with different quantization bit-widths. Afterwards, we (c) convert these patches to the DCT domain and conduct quantization to each patch based on the allocated bit-width. The proposed Delta-DCT does not require any training or data calibration, while achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing original finetuned models under 1-bit equivalent delta compression ratios on different kinds of models including: (1) recently-released LLMs of different sizes from 7B to 13B, (2) relatively smaller language models including RoBERTa and T5 models, (3) variants of vision transformer models, and (4) multi-modal BEiT-3 models.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system where distributed access points (APs) perform integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) tasks, enabling simultaneous user communication and target detection/tracking. A unified framework and signal model are developed for the detection of potential targets and tracking of previously detected ones, even in arbitrary positions. Leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test technique, novel detection/tracking algorithms are proposed to handle unknown target responses and interference. Scalable AP-user and AP-target association rules are evaluated, explicitly considering multi-zone sensing scenarios. Additionally, a scalable power control mechanism extends fractional power control principles to ISAC, balancing power allocation between communication and sensing tasks. For benchmarking, a non-scalable power control optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the minimum user data rate while ensuring a Quality of Service constraint for sensing, solved via successive convex approximation. Extensive numerical results validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in both communication and sensing, revealing the impact of interference from other targets, and highlighting fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performance.</p>

Feature embeddings from each modality are concatenated to form a multimodal vector, which is then used to predict emotion and sentiment labels. The multimodal system demonstrates superior performance compared to unimodal approaches, achieving an accuracy of 66.36% for emotion recognition and 72.15% for sentiment analysis.</p>

            <p>The exploration of Bird's-Eye View (BEV) mapping technology has driven significant innovation in visual perception technology for autonomous driving. BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping.

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels by intelligently regulating the phase shifts of reflecting elements. Recently, various codebook schemes have been utilized to optimize the reflection coefficients (RCs); however, the selection of the optimal codeword is usually obtained by evaluating a metric of interest. In this letter, we propose a novel weighted design on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook to obtain the optimal RCs for RIS-assisted point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol where we configure the RIS RCs using the DFT codebook to obtain a set of observations through the uplink training process. Secondly, based on these observed samples, the Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to optimize the weights in an iterative manner, which could result in a higher channel capacity for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of different codeword configuration orders on system performance and design an efficient codeword configuration method based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <p>Video-to-audio generation is essential for synthesizing realistic audio tracks that synchronize effectively with silent videos. Following the perspective of extracting essential signals from videos that can precisely control the mature text-to-audio generative diffusion models, this paper presents how to balance the representation of mel-spectrograms in terms of completeness and complexity through a new approach called Mel Quantization-Continuum Decomposition (Mel-QCD). We decompose the mel-spectrogram into three distinct types of signals, employing quantization or continuity to them, we can effectively predict them from video by a devised video-to-all (V2X) predictor. Then, the predicted signals are recomposed and fed into a ControlNet, along with a textual inversion design, to control the audio generation process. Our proposed Mel-QCD method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across eight metrics, evaluating dimensions such as quality, synchronization, and semantic consistency.

In this work we analyse the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the parameters of projected gradient descent as the algorithm of choice. We derive closed-form expressions for sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the parameters of the projected gradient and to time-varying model mismatch. The formulas are then used for analysis of model mismatch in a gas lift optimization problem. The results of the case study indicate that the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the model mismatch depends on how long the controller has been running, with decreasing sensitivity to mismatch in individual timesteps for long operation times.</p>

            <p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Operation of Renewable Energy Communities under Demand Response Programs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianni Bianchini, Marco Casini, Milad Gholami</p>
            <p>Within the context of renewable energy communities, this paper focuses on optimal operation of producers equipped with energy storage systems in the presence of demand response. A novel strategy for optimal scheduling of the storage systems of the community members under price-volume demand response programs, is devised. The underlying optimization problem is designed as a low-complexity mixed-integer linear program that scales well with the community size. Once the optimal solution is found, an algorithm for distributing the demand response rewards is introduced in order to guarantee fairness among participants. The proposed approach ensures increased benefits for producers joining a community compared to standalone operation.</p>

            <h2>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhuo Li, Jiakang Zheng, Bokai Xu, Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Bo Ai</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luigi Russo, Antonietta Sorriso, Silvia Liberata Ullo, Paolo Gamba</p>
            <p>Land Cover (LC) mapping using satellite imagery is critical for environmental monitoring and management. Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p>

            <h2>Virtual VNA 3.0: Unambiguous Scattering Matrix Estimation for Non-Reciprocal Systems by Leveraging Tunable and Coupled Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp del Hougne</p>
            <p>We present the "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique for estimating the scattering matrix of a \textit{non-reciprocal}, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using a single measurement setup involving a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only $N_\mathrm{A}<N$ ports -- thus eliminating the need for any reconnections. We partition the DUT ports into $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" and $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports. We connect the accessible ports to the VNA and the NDA ports to the "virtual VNA ports" of a VNA Extension Kit. This kit enables each NDA port to be terminated with three distinct individual loads or connected to neighboring DUT ports via coupled loads. We derive both a closed-form and a gradient-descent method to estimate the complete scattering matrix of the non-reciprocal DUT from measurements conducted with the $N_\mathrm{A}$-port VNA under various NDA-port terminations. We validate both methods experimentally for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, where our DUT is a complex eight-port transmission-line network comprising circulators. Altogether, the presented "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique constitutes a scalable approach to unambiguously characterize a many-port \textit{non-reciprocal} DUT with a few-port VNA (only $N_\mathrm{A}>1$ is required) -- without any tedious and error-prone manual reconnections susceptible to inaccuracies. The VNA Extension Kit requirements match those for the "Virtual VNA 2.0" technique that was limited to reciprocal DUTs.</p>

            <h2>Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Kezhi Wang, Merouane Debbah</p>
            <p>Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.</p>

            <h2>Federated Learning in NTNs: Design, Architecture and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Farajzadeh, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu</p>
            <p>Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.</p>

            <h2>Is fitting error a reliable metric for assessing deformable motion correction in quantitative MRI?</h2>

            <p>Quantitative MR (qMR) can provide numerical values representing the physical and chemical properties of the tissues. To collect a series of frames under varying settings, retrospective motion correction is essential to align the corresponding anatomical points or features. Under the assumption that the misalignment makes the discrepancy between the corresponding features larger, fitting error is a commonly used evaluation metric for motion correction in qMR. This study evaluates the reliability of the fitting error metric in cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) after deformable registration. We found that while fitting error correlates with the negative eigenvalues, the negative Jacobian Determinant increases with broken cardiomyocytes, indicated by helix angle gradient line profiles. Since fitting error measures the distance between moved points and their re-rendered counterparts, the fitting parameter itself may be adjusted due to poor registration. Therefore, fitting error in deformable registration itself is a necessary but not sufficient metric and should be combined with other metrics.</p>

            <h2>Decision-Dependent Stochastic Optimization: The Role of Distribution Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu He, Saverio Bolognani, Florian Dörfler, Michael Muehlebach</p>
            <p>Distribution shifts have long been regarded as troublesome external forces that a decision-maker should either counteract or conform to. An intriguing feedback phenomenon termed decision dependence arises when the deployed decision affects the environment and alters the data-generating distribution. In the realm of performative prediction, this is encoded by distribution maps parameterized by decisions due to strategic behaviors. In contrast, we formalize an endogenous distribution shift as a feedback process featuring nonlinear dynamics that couple the evolving distribution with the decision. Stochastic optimization in this dynamic regime provides a fertile ground to examine the various roles played by dynamics in the composite problem structure. To this end, we develop an online algorithm that achieves optimal decision-making by both adapting to and shaping the dynamic distribution. Throughout the paper, we adopt a distributional perspective and demonstrate how this view facilitates characterizations of distribution dynamics and the optimality and generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. We showcase the theoretical results in an opinion dynamics context, where an opportunistic party maximizes the affinity of a dynamic polarized population, and in a recommender system scenario, featuring performance optimization with discrete distributions in the probability simplex.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the design strategies for hybrid pole- or trunk-climbing robots, focusing on methods to inform design decisions and assess metrics such as adaptability and performance. A wheeled-grasping hybrid robot with modular, tendon-driven grasping arms and a wheeled drive system mounted on a turret was developed to climb columns of varying diameters. Here, the key innovation is the underactuated arms that can be adjusted to different column sizes by adding or removing modular linkages, though the robot also features capabilities like self-locking (the ability of the robot to stay on the column by friction without power), autonomous grasping, and rotation around the column axis. Mathematical models describe conditions for self-locking and vertical climbing. Experimental results demonstrate the robot's efficacy in climbing and self-locking, validating the proposed models and highlighting the potential for fully automated solutions in industrial applications. This work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and designing hybrid climbing robots, contributing to advancements in autonomous robotics for environments where climbing tall structures is critical.</p>

            <h2>Open-Set Gait Recognition from Sparse mmWave Radar Point Clouds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Mazzieri, Jacopo Pegoraro, Michele Rossi</p>
            <p>The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.</p>

            <p>Given the substantial growth in the use of additive manufacturing in construction (AMC), it is necessary to ensure the quality of printed specimens which can be much more complex than conventionally manufactured parts. This study explores the various aspects of geometry and surface quality control for 3D concrete printing (3DCP), with a particular emphasis on deposition-based methods, namely extrusion and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP). A comprehensive overview of existing quality control (QC) methods and strategies is provided and preceded by an in-depth discussion. Four categories of data capture technologies are investigated and their advantages and limitations in the context of AMC are discussed. Additionally, the effects of environmental conditions and objects' properties on data capture are also analyzed. The study extends to automated data capture planning methods for different sensors. Furthermore, various quality control strategies are explored across different stages of the fabrication cycle of the printed object including: (i) During printing, (ii) Layer-wise, (iii) Preassembly, and (iv) Assembly. In addition to reviewing the methods already applied in AMC, we also address various research gaps and future trends and highlight potential methodologies from adjacent domains that could be transferred to AMC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mojtaba Vaezi, Xinliang Zhang</p>
            <p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA. Various test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of interference-aware constellations in improving the bit error rate, indicating the adaptability of AE-NOMA to different channel scenarios and its promising potential for implementing NOMA systems</p>

            <p>Predicting clinical outcomes from medical images using quantitative features (``radiomics'') requires many method design choices, Currently, in new clinical applications, finding the optimal radiomics method out of the wide range of methods relies on a manual, heuristic trial-and-error process. We introduce a novel automated framework that optimizes radiomics workflow construction per application by standardizing the radiomics workflow in modular components, including a large collection of algorithms for each component, and formulating a combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem. To solve it, we employ automated machine learning through two strategies (random search and Bayesian optimization) and three ensembling approaches. Results show that a medium-sized random search and straight-forward ensembling perform similar to more advanced methods while being more efficient. Validated across twelve clinical applications, our approach outperforms both a radiomics baseline and human experts. Concluding, our framework improves and streamlines radiomics research by fully automatically optimizing radiomics workflow construction. To facilitate reproducibility, we publicly release six datasets, software of the method, and code to reproduce this study.</p>

            <p>The sixth generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICT). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios, but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To realize this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited, so as to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for five promising technologies enabling 6G, including terahertz (THz), extreme MIMO (E-MIMO), ISAC, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Then, a survey of the progress of the 6G channel research regarding the above five promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. Moreover, a tutorial on the 6G channel simulations is presented. We introduce the BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030, a 6G link-level channel simulator, developed based on the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. The simulator supports the channel simulation of the aforementioned 6G potential technologies. To facilitate the use of the simulator, the tutorial encompasses the design framework, user guidelines, and application examples. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.</p>

            <p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a critical research domain within the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The distributed Kalman filter (DKF) has garnered significant attention as an information fusion method for WSNs. However, effectively handling non-Gaussian environments remains a crucial challenge for DKF. This paper proposes a solution by partitioning the noise distribution into multiple Gaussian components, thereby approximating the measurement model with sub-models. We introduce a model fusion distributed Kalman filter (MFDKF) that combines sub-models by assuming independent random processes for the model's transition probabilities. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the relevant parameters. To address specific requirements in WSNs that demand high consensus or have limited communication, two derivative algorithms, namely consensus MFDKF (C-MFDKF) and simplified MFDKF (S-MFDKF), are proposed based on consensus theory. The convergence of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms is analyzed. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Chen, Nuria González-Prelcic, Takayuki Shimizu, Hongsheng Lu</p>
            <p>One strategy to obtain user location information in a wireless network operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) is based on the exploitation of the geometric relationships between the channel parameters and the user position. These relationships can be built from the line-of-sight (LOS) path and first-order reflections, or purely first-order reflections, requiring high resolution channel estimates to ensure centimeter level accuracy. In this paper, we consider a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing a hybrid architecture, and develop a low complexity two-stage multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) algorithm suitable for accurate estimation of high dimensional channels. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) called PathNet is designed to classify the order of the estimated channel paths, so that only the LOS path and first-order reflections are selected for localization. Next, a 3D localization strategy exploiting the geometry of the environment is developed to operate in both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, while considering the unknown clock offset between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX). Finally, a Transformer based network exploiting attention mechanisms called ChanFormer is proposed to refine the initial position estimate obtained from geometric localization. Simulation results obtained with realistic vehicular channels indicate that localization errors below 28 cm can be achieved for 80% of the users when the LOS path is present, while sub-meter accuracy can be achieved for 55% of the users in NLOS conditions.</p>

            <p>Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</p>

            <p>HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) has emerged as a prevalent approach for over-the-top (OTT)video streaming services due to its ability to deliver a seamless user experience. A fundamental component of HAS is the bitrate ladder, which comprises a set of encoding parameters (e.g., bitrate-resolution pairs) used to encode the source video into multiple representations. This adaptive bitrate ladder enables the client's video player to dynamically adjust the quality of the video stream in real-time based on fluctuations in network conditions, ensuring uninterrupted playback by selecting the most suitable representation for the available bandwidth. The most straightforward approach involves using a fixed bitrate ladder for all videos, consisting of pre-determined bitrate-resolution pairs known as one-size-fits-all. Conversely, the most reliable technique relies on intensively encoding all resolutions over a wide range of bitrates to build the convex hull, thereby optimizing the bitrate ladder by selecting the representations from the convex hull for each specific video. Several techniques have been proposed to predict content-based ladders without performing a costly, exhaustive search encoding. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various convex hull prediction methods, including both conventional and learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we conduct a benchmark study of several handcrafted- and deep learning (DL)-based approaches for predicting content-optimized convex hulls across multiple codec settings. The considered methods are evaluated on our proposed large-scale dataset, which includes 300 UHD video shots encoded with software and hardware encoders using three state-of-the-art video standards, including ACV/H.264, HEVC/H.265, and VVC/H.266, at various bitrate points.

To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms in autonomous driving simulators.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti</p>
            <p>We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</p>

            <h2>Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shingo Takemoto, Kazuki Naganuma, Shunsuke Ono</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined by the l1-norm of second-order spatio-spectral differences, is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the underlying spatio-spectral properties. However, since SSTV refers only to adjacent pixels/bands, semi-local spatial structures are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, defined using the nuclear norms of matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors for each band in semi-local area (we call these matrices as spatio-spectral structure tensors). The design of this regularization function preserves the semi-local spatial structures and the spectral correlation across all bands while ensuring robust mixed noise removal. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nimrod Shabtay, Eli Schwartz, Raja Giryes</p>
            <p>Phase-coded imaging is a computational imaging method designed to tackle tasks such as passive depth estimation and extended depth of field (EDOF) using depth cues inserted during image capture. Most of the current deep learning-based methods for depth estimation or all-in-focus imaging require a training dataset with high-quality depth maps and an optimal focus point at infinity for all-in-focus images. Such datasets are difficult to create, usually synthetic, and require external graphic programs. We propose a new method named "Deep Phase Coded Image Prior" (DPCIP) for jointly recovering the depth map and all-in-focus image from a coded-phase image using solely the captured image and the optical information of the imaging system. Our approach does not depend on any specific dataset and surpasses prior supervised techniques utilizing the same imaging system. This improvement is achieved through the utilization of a problem formulation based on implicit neural representation (INR) and deep image prior (DIP). Due to our zero-shot method, we overcome the barrier of acquiring accurate ground-truth data of depth maps and all-in-focus images for each new phase-coded system introduced. This allows focusing mainly on developing the imaging system, and not on ground-truth data collection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngoc-Du Tran, Thi-Thao Tran, Quang-Huy Nguyen, Manh-Hung Vu, Van-Truong Pham</p>
            <p>The emergence of deep learning techniques has advanced the image segmentation task, especially for medical images. Many neural network models have been introduced in the last decade bringing the automated segmentation accuracy close to manual segmentation. However, cutting-edge models like Transformer-based architectures rely on large scale annotated training data, and are generally designed with densely consecutive layers in the encoder, decoder, and skip connections resulting in large number of parameters. Additionally, for better performance, they often be pretrained on a larger data, thus requiring large memory size and increasing resource expenses. In this study, we propose a new lightweight but efficient model, namely LiteNeXt, based on convolutions and mixing modules with simplified decoder, for medical image segmentation. The model is trained from scratch with small amount of parameters (0.71M) and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (0.42). To handle boundary fuzzy as well as occlusion or clutter in objects especially in medical image regions, we propose the Marginal Weight Loss that can help effectively determine the marginal boundary between object and background. Additionally, the Self-embedding Representation Parallel technique is proposed as an innovative data augmentation strategy that utilizes the network architecture itself for self-learning augmentation, enhancing feature extraction robustness without external data. Experiments on public datasets including Data Science Bowls, GlaS, ISIC2018, PH2, Sunnybrook, and Lung X-ray data show promising results compared to other state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyi Wang, Angeliki Katsenou, David Bull</p>
            <p>With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild is increasingly evident. UGC is typically acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression (transcoding) before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that employ the original content as a reference are not suitable. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the quality of diverse video content without reference to the original uncompressed videos. ReLaX-VQA uses frame differences to select spatio-temporal fragments intelligently together with different expressions of spatial features associated with the sampled frames. These are then used to better capture spatial and temporal variabilities in the quality of neighbouring frames. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers. Extensive testing across four UGC datasets demonstrates that ReLaX-VQA consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving an average SRCC of 0.8658 and PLCC of 0.8873. Open-source code and trained models that will facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA can be found at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Song, Jiaxiang He, Lijie Yang, Mingtao Feng, Keyan Wang</p>
            <p>Diffusion probabilistic models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, balancing high perceptual quality and low distortion remains challenging in image compression applications. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Uncertainty-Guided image compression approach with wavelet Diffusion (UGDiff). Our approach focuses on high frequency compression via the wavelet transform, since high frequency components are crucial for reconstructing image details. We introduce a wavelet conditional diffusion model for high frequency prediction, followed by a residual codec that compresses and transmits prediction residuals to the decoder. This diffusion prediction-then-residual compression paradigm effectively addresses the low fidelity issue common in direct reconstructions by existing diffusion models. Considering the uncertainty from the random sampling of the diffusion model, we further design an uncertainty-weighted rate-distortion (R-D) loss tailored for residual compression, providing a more rational trade-off between rate and distortion. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of UGDiff, surpassing state-of-the-art image compression methods in R-D performance, perceptual quality, subjective quality, and inference time.

            <h2>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond Diagonal RIS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhao, Hongyu Li, Bruno Clerckx, Massimo Franceschetti</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) in terms of singular values for improved wireless (e.g., rate and power) performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical bounds are derived under popular RIS deployment scenarios to showcase the shaping potentials of BD-RIS on the channel Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. A numerical optimization method is then proposed for a broader range of shaping problems and invoked to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a low-complexity shaping-inspired approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values and the trade-off in manipulating them, resulting in enhanced power gain and achievable rate. Those benefits become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission (hence achieving the asymptotic DoF) at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its singular value shaping proficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang-Gen Xia, Wei Wang</p>
            <p>Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bai Xue</p>
            <p>In this paper, we examine necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for infinite-horizon safety verification and reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems, derived through a relaxation of Bellman equations. Unlike previous methods focused on barrier-like conditions that primarily address sufficiency, our work rigorously integrates both necessity and sufficiency for properties pertaining to infinite time. Safety verification aims to certify the satisfaction of the safety property, which stipulates that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, remaining within a safe set always is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. A necessary and sufficient barrier-like condition is formulated for safety verification. In contrast, reach-avoid verification extends beyond safety to include reachability, seeking to certify the satisfaction of the reach-avoid property. It requires that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, reaching a target set eventually while remaining within a safe set until the first hit of the target, is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. Two necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions are formulated under certain assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Subspace Representation Learning for Sparse Linear Arrays to Localize More Sources than Sensors: A Deep Learning Methodology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuan-Lin Chen, Bhaskar D. Rao</p>
            <p>Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.</p>

            <p>Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in industrial and medical imaging, but sparse-view scanning reduces radiation exposure at the cost of incomplete sinograms and challenging reconstruction. Existing RGB-based inpainting models struggle with severe feature entanglement, while sinogram-specific methods often lack explicit physics constraints. We propose FCDM, a physics-guided, frequency-aware sinogram inpainting framework. It integrates bidirectional frequency-domain convolutions to disentangle overlapping features while enforcing total absorption and frequency-domain consistency via a physics-informed loss. To enhance diffusion-based restoration, we introduce a Fourier-enhanced mask embedding to encode angular dependencies and a frequency-adaptive noise scheduling strategy that incorporates a soft row-wise absorption constraint to maintain physical realism. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that FCDM outperforms existing methods, achieving SSIM over 0.95 and PSNR above 30 dB, with up to 33% and 29% improvements over baselines.</p>

            <h2>Self-Supervised Speed of Sound Recovery for Aberration-Corrected Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianao Li, Manxiu Cui, Cheng Ma, Emma Alexander</p>
            <p>Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images using a differentiable physics model to solve the semi-blind inverse problem. The SOS, parametrized by either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF), is updated directly by backpropagation. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in-vivo data.</p>

            <p>Super-Resolution Ultrasound (SRUS) imaging through localising and tracking microbubbles, also known as Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM), has demonstrated significant potential for reconstructing microvasculature and flows with sub-diffraction resolution in clinical diagnostics. However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</p>

            <p>In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</p>

            <p>Previous work indicates evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in brain waste clearance processes, and that altered flow patterns are associated with various diseases of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the distribution in human brain of a gadolinium-based CSF contrast agent (tracer) administered intrathecal. For this, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken at multiple time points before and after injection were utilized. We propose a U-net-based supervised learning model to predict pixel-wise signal increase at its peak after 24 hours. Performance is evaluated based on different tracer distribution stages provided during training, including predictions from baseline scans taken before injection. Our findings show that training with imaging data from only the first two hours post-injection yields tracer flow predictions comparable to models trained with additional later-stage scans. Validation against ventricular reflux gradings from neuroradiologists confirmed alignment with expert evaluations. These results demonstrate that deep learning-based methods for CSF flow prediction deserve more attention, as minimizing MR imaging without compromising clinical analysis could enhance efficiency, improve patient well-being, and lower healthcare costs.</p>

            <p>Uncontrolled cell division in the brain is what gives rise to brain tumors. If the tumor size increases by more than half, there is little hope for the patient's recovery. This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of the brain, a CNN was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this research. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved and we also localized the tumor regions from the unannotated images using GradCAM, a deep learning explainability tool. In order to evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the features into different ML models. CNN and machine learning models were also evaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the CNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the patient.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</p>

            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) is a promising solution to increase the utilization of transmission lines by adjusting ratings based on real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecast at the scheduling stage is thus necessary for system operators to proactively optimize power flows, manage congestion, and reduce the cost of grid operations. However, the DLR forecast remains challenging due to weather uncertainty. To reliably predict DLRs, we propose a new probabilistic forecasting model based on line graph convolutional LSTM. Like standard LSTM networks, our model accounts for temporal correlations between DLRs across the planning horizon. The line graph-structured network additionally allows us to leverage the spatial correlations of DLR features across the grid to improve the quality of predictions. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline probabilistic DLR forecasting models regarding reliability and sharpness while using the fewest parameters.</p>

            <p>Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex, unknown processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering up to 9.3$\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods.

            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), serves as a ``microscope'' for anatomical structures and routinely mitigates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio scans by compromising temporal or spatial resolution. However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

            <h2>Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahshid Shiri, Chandra Bortolotto, Alessandro Bruno, Alessio Consonni, Daniela Maria Grasso, Leonardo Brizzi, Daniele Loiacono, Lorenzo Preda</p>
            <p>Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.</p>

            <h2>Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Wen, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, William Freeman, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An</p>
            <p>We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a small amount of works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a foundational universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves cross-modality retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work to study retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.</p>

            <p>A concise tutorial is provided for analysis of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based continuous electromagnetic (EM) channels. First, a simplified spatial model is introduced using the Fresnel approximation. By leveraging this model and Landau's theorem, a closed-form expression for the spatial DoFs is derived. The results show that the number of DoFs is proportional to the transmit and receive aperture sizes and inversely proportional to the propagation distance. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the properties of EM DoFs in CAPA-based channels.</p>

            <h2>VesselSAM: Leveraging SAM for Aortic Vessel Segmentation with LoRA and Atrous Attention</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adnan Iltaf, Rayan Merghani Ahmed, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou</p>
            <p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Binucci, Osvaldo Simeone, Paolo Banelli</p>
            <p>This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</p>

            <h2>A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunian Pan, Jun Li, Lifan Xu, Shunqiao Sun, Quanyan Zhu</p>
            <p>Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.</p>

            <h2>Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation for Unsupervised Chorioallantoic Membrane Vessel Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwu Song, Liang Xu, Peng Yao, Shuwei Shen, Pengfei Shao, Mingzhai Sun, Ronald X. Xu</p>
            <p>The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is widely employed in angiogenesis research, and distribution of growing blood vessels is the key evaluation indicator. As a result, vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative assessment based on topology and morphology. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to its subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms remains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between CAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to perform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate intermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate Domain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle cross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily concentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate domain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method outperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in UDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

            <h2>Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuhang Yang, Puguang An, Peng Yang, Xianbin Cao, Dapeng Oliver Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
            <p>To tackle the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper introduces an innovative SnS near-field CE framework grounded in adaptive subarray partitioning. Conventional methods relying on equal subarray partitioning often lead to suboptimal divisions, undermining CE precision. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive subarray segmentation approach. First, we develop a spherical-wave channel model customized for line-of-sight (LoS) XL-MIMO systems to capture SnS traits. Next, we define and evaluate the adverse effects of over-segmentation and under-segmentation on CE efficacy. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which merges cost-effective power measurements with a DHBF structure, enabling joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A robust partitioning algorithm, termed power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS), exploits statistical features of power profiles, while the DHBF utilizes subarray segmentation-based group time block code (SS-GTBC) to enable efficient subarray decoupling with limited radio frequency (RF) chain resources. Additionally, by utilizing angular-domain block sparsity and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV), employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks to lower complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the exceptional performance of the proposed framework over its counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx, David Vargas, Oliver Haffenden, Andrew Murphy</p>
            <p>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.</p>

            <p>Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadav Cohen, Itzik Klein</p>
            <p>The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.</p>

            <p>We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</p>

            <p>Sound content creation, essential for multimedia works such as video games and films, often involves extensive trial-and-error, enabling creators to semantically reflect their artistic ideas and inspirations, which evolve throughout the creation process, into the sound. Recent high-quality diffusion-based Text-to-Sound (T2S) generative models provide valuable tools for creators. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds, imposing an undesirable burden that hinders the trial-and-error process. While existing T2S distillation models address this limitation through 1-step generation, the sample quality of $1$-step generation remains insufficient for production use. Additionally, while multi-step sampling in those distillation models improves sample quality itself, the semantic content changes due to their lack of deterministic sampling capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM), which allow flexible transitions between high-quality $1$-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step deterministic sampling. This allows creators to efficiently conduct trial-and-error with 1-step generation to semantically align samples with their intention, and subsequently refine sample quality with preserving semantic content through deterministic multi-step sampling. To develop SoundCTM, we reframe the CTM training framework, originally proposed in computer vision, and introduce a novel feature distance using the teacher network for a distillation loss. For production-level generation, we scale up our model to 1B trainable parameters, making SoundCTM-DiT-1B the first large-scale distillation model in the sound community to achieve both promising high-quality 1-step and multi-step full-band (44.1kHz) generation.</p>

            <h2>Surpassing Cosine Similarity for Multidimensional Comparisons: Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Tessari, Kunpeng Yao, Neville Hogan</p>
            <p>Advances in computational power and hardware efficiency have enabled tackling increasingly complex, high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieves remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis. Metrics such as cosine similarity are often used, for example in the development of natural language processing algorithms or recommender systems. However, the interpretability of such metrics diminishes as dimensions increase. This paper analyzes the effects of dimensionality, revealing significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimension of vectors, leading to biased and poorly interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce a Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. An example of the advantages of DIEM over cosine similarity is reported for a large language model application. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ce Wang, Zhenyu Hu, Wanjie Sun, Zhenzhong Chen</p>
            <p>Image rescaling aims to learn the optimal low-resolution (LR) image that can be accurately reconstructed to its original high-resolution (HR) counterpart, providing an efficient image processing and storage method for ultra-high definition media. However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges to the upscaling process due to its highly ill-posed nature, causing existing image rescaling methods to struggle in generating semantically correct structures and perceptual friendly textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM) for extreme image rescaling, which performs rescaling operations in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder and effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, TADM adopts a pseudo-invertible module to establish the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. Then, the rescaled latent features are enhanced by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful details. Considering the spatially non-uniform degradation caused by the rescaling operation, we propose a novel time-step alignment strategy, which can adaptively allocate the generative capacity of the diffusion model based on the quality of the reconstructed latent features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TADM over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p>

            <p>Occupational outcomes like entrepreneurship are generally considered personal information that individuals should have the autonomy to disclose. With the advancing capability of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer private details from widely available human-centric data (e.g., social media), it is crucial to investigate whether AI can accurately extract private occupational information from such data. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks can classify individuals as entrepreneurs with high accuracy based on facial images sourced from Crunchbase, a premier source for entrepreneurship data. Utilizing a dataset comprising facial images of 40,728 individuals, including both entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a contrastive learning approach based on pairs of facial images (one entrepreneur and one non-entrepreneur per pair). While human experts (n=650) and trained participants (n=133) were unable to classify entrepreneurs with accuracy above chance levels (>50%), our AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 79.51%. Several robustness tests indicate that this high level of accuracy is maintained under various conditions. These results indicate privacy risks for entrepreneurs.</p>

            <p>Low latency models are critical for real-time speech enhancement applications, such as hearing aids and hearables. However, the sub-millisecond latency space for resource-constrained hearables remains underexplored. We demonstrate speech enhancement using a computationally efficient minimum-phase FIR filter, enabling sample-by-sample processing to achieve mean algorithmic latency of 0.32 ms to 1.25 ms. With a single microphone, we observe a mean SI-SDRi of 4.1 dB. The approach shows generalization with a DNSMOS increase of 0.2 on unseen audio recordings. We use a lightweight LSTM-based model of 626k parameters to generate FIR taps. Using a real hardware implementation on a low-power DSP, our system can run with 376 MIPS and a mean end-to-end latency of 3.35 ms. In addition, we provide a comparison with existing low-latency spectral masking techniques. We hope this work will enable a better understanding of latency and can be used to improve the comfort and usability of hearables.</p>

            <p>Animal vocalization denoising is a task similar to human speech enhancement, which is relatively well-studied. In contrast to the latter, it comprises a higher diversity of sound production mechanisms and recording environments, and this higher diversity is a challenge for existing models. Adding to the challenge and in contrast to speech, we lack large and diverse datasets comprising clean vocalizations. As a solution we use as training data pseudo-clean targets, i.e. pre-denoised vocalizations, and segments of background noise without a vocalization. We propose a train set derived from bioacoustics datasets and repositories representing diverse species, acoustic environments, geographic regions. Additionally, we introduce a non-overlapping benchmark set comprising clean vocalizations from different taxa and noise samples. We show that that denoising models (demucs, CleanUNet) trained on pseudo-clean targets obtained with speech enhancement models achieve competitive results on the benchmarking set.
