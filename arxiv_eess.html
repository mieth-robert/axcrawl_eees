            <h2>Improving diabetic retinopathy screening using Artificial Intelligence: design, evaluation and before-and-after study of a custom development</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imanol Pinto, Álvaro Olazarán, David Jurío, Borja de la Osa, Miguel Sainz, Aritz Oscoz, Jerónimo Ballaz, Javier Gorricho, Mikel Galar, José Andonegui</p>
            <p>Background: The worst outcomes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be prevented by implementing DR screening programs assisted by AI. At the University Hospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus images in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening level (ophthalmologist) target patients. Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom AI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper introduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique combination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its impact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares 19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients screened after. Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing their sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for non-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\% to 86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in most of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them as referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study visualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of sight-threatening DR referred by a GP. Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which could be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening. This shows how AI devices, when seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, can help improve clinical pathways in the long term.</p>

            <h2>Co-optimization of Vehicle Dynamics and Powertrain Management for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongtan Li, Yunli Shao</p>
            <p>Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) represent the future of transportation, utilizing detailed traffic information to enhance control and decision-making. Eco-driving of CAVs has the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency, and the benefits are maximized when both vehicle speed and powertrain operation are optimized. In this paper, we studied the co-optimization of vehicle speed and powertrain management for energy savings in a dual-motor electric vehicle. Control-oriented vehicle dynamics and electric powertrain models were developed to transform the problem into an optimal control problem specifically designed to facilitate real-time computation. Simulation validation was conducted using real-world data calibrated traffic simulation scenarios in Chattanooga, TN. Evaluation results demonstrated a 12.80-24.52% reduction in the vehicle's power consumption under ideal predicted traffic conditions, while maintaining benefits with various prediction uncertainties, such as Gaussian process uncertainties on acceleration and time-shift effects on predicted speed. The energy savings of the proposed eco-driving strategy are achieved through effective speed control and optimized torque allocation. The proposed model can be extended to various CAV and electric vehicle applications, with potential adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting sparse structures and synergy designs to advance situational awareness of electrical power grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>The growing threats of uncertainties, anomalies, and cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry-standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non-actionable results. Estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge. This thesis addresses robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm -- Physics-ML Synergy -- which integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats, pinpointing dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimizations to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by interconnecting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML.</p>

            <h2>Carbon-Aware Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Andy Sun, Wenbo Shi, Na Li</p>
            <p>To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</p>

            <h2>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets (Extended version)</h2>

            <p>The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</p>

            <h2>On the Time-Frequency Localization Characteristics of the Delay-Doppler Plane Orthogonal Pulse</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akram Shafie, Jinhong Yuan, Nan Yang, Hai Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the time-frequency (TF) localization characteristics of the prototype pulse of orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing modulation, namely, the DD plane orthogonal pulse (DDOP). The TF localization characteristics examine how concentrated or spread out the energy of a pulse is in the joint TF domain, the time domain (TD), and the frequency domain (FD). We first derive the TF localization metrics of the DDOP, including its TF area, its time and frequency dispersions, and its direction parameter. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the DDOP exhibits a high energy spread in the TD, FD, and the joint TF domain, while adhering to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thereafter, we discuss the potential advantages brought by the energy spread of the DDOP, especially with regard to harnessing both time and frequency diversities and enabling fine-resolution sensing. Subsequently, we examine the relationships between the time and frequency dispersions of the DDOP and those of the envelope functions of DDOP's TD and FD representations, paving the way for simplified determination of the TF localization metrics for more generalized variants of the DDOP and the pulses used in other DD domain modulation schemes. Finally, using numerical results, we validate our analysis and find further insights.</p>

            <h2>Squint-Aware ISAC Precoding Towards Enhanced Dual-Functional Gain in Sub-Terahertz Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading communication performance. Existing hybrid precoding designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware hybrid precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware to enhance integrated gain. We introduce a squint-aware optimization-based hybrid precoding algorithm (SA-Opt) and develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we formulate an input-output economic model with multiple interactive economic systems. The model captures the multi-dimensional nature of the economic sectors or industries in each economic system, the interdependencies among industries within an economic system and across different economic systems, and the influence of demand. To determine the equilibrium price structure of the model, a matrix-weighted updating algorithm is proposed. We prove that the equilibrium price structure can be globally asymptotically achieved given that certain joint conditions on the matrix-weighted graph and the input-output matrices are satisfied. The theoretical results are then supported by numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>A Proximity-Based Approach for Dynamically Matching Industrial Assets and Their Operators Using Low-Power IoT Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvano Cortesi, Michele Crabolu, Prodromos-Vasileios Mekikis, Giovanni Bellusci, Christian Vogt, Michele Magno</p>
            <p>Asset tracking solutions have proven their significance in industrial contexts, as evidenced by their successful commercialization (e.g., Hilti On!Track). However, a seamless solution for matching assets with their users, such as operators of construction power tools, is still missing. By enabling assetuser matching, organizations gain valuable insights that can be used to optimize user health and safety, asset utilization, and maintenance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this gap by leveraging existing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed framework comprises the following components: i) a wearable device, ii) an IoT device attached to or embedded in the assets, iii) an algorithm to estimate the distance between assets and operators by exploiting simple received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and iv) a cloud-based algorithm that collects all estimated distances to derive the correct asset-operator matching. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through indoor and outdoor experiments in a construction setting for identifying the operator of a power tool. A physical prototype was developed to evaluate the algorithms in a realistic setup. The results demonstrated a median accuracy of 0.49m in estimating the distance between assets and users, and up to 98.6% in correctly matching users with their assets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alva Kosasih, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson</p>
            <p>A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) alters the reflection of incoming signals based on the phase-shift configuration assigned to its elements. This feature can be used to improve the signal strength for user equipments (UEs), expand coverage, and enhance spectral efficiency in wideband communication systems. Having accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable to realize the full potential of RIS-aided wideband systems. Unfortunately, CSI is challenging to acquire due to the passive nature of the RIS elements, which cannot perform transmit/receive signal processing. Recently, a parametric maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimator has been developed and demonstrated excellent estimation accuracy. However, this estimator is designed for narrowband systems with no non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we develop a novel parametric ML channel estimator for RIS-assisted wideband systems, which can handle line-of-sight (LOS) paths in the base station (BS)-RIS and RIS-UE links as well as NLOS paths between the UE, BS, and RIS. We leverage the reduced subspace representation induced by the array geometry to suppress noise in unused dimensions, enabling accurate estimation of the NLOS paths. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates superior estimation performance for the BS-UE and RIS-UE channels, outperforming the existing ML channel estimator.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enea Figini, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Large District Heating System Models Using Open-Source Data and Tools: An Exemplary Workflow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Stock, Till Schmidt, André Xhonneux, Dirk Müller</p>
            <p>District heating (DH) systems play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the building sector's heat supply. While innovative low-exergy DH and cooling systems are increasingly adopted in new developments, the transformation of existing DH systems remains critical, as many still depend on fossil-based heating plants. Achieving a sustainable heat supply necessitates integrating renewable energy and waste heat sources into current DH systems and enhancing operational efficiency through measures such as reduced supply temperatures and advanced control algorithms. These improvements can reduce costs and CO2 emissions but may require infrastructure adaptations, including pipe replacements and building-level system adjustments. This paper introduces a workflow for generating DH models using publicly available data and open-source tools. Such models enable comprehensive analyses of existing DH systems, allowing for the evaluation of sustainable heat integration, operational improvements, and the testing of analytical tools, such as simulation and optimization models. The workflow, detailed in this study, combines general structural data with computational estimations to create digital representations of DH systems. These models facilitate scenario-based analyses, tool benchmarking, and the identification of necessary infrastructure adaptations. Two example DH models generated using the proposed workflow are presented, followed by a discussion of the methodology's applicability and limitations. This study demonstrates how leveraging open data and tools can advance the transformation of DH systems, supporting the transition to a sustainable heat supply infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</p>

            <h2>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingzhu Wen, Yong Zhou, Xiaoyang Li, Yuanming Shi, Kaibin Huang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p>

            <h2>RIS-aided Wireless-Powered Backscatter Communications for Sustainable Internet of Underground Things</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiang Lin, Yijie Mao</p>
            <p>Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</p>

            <h2>Generative Modeling and Data Augmentation for Power System Production Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>As a key component of power system production simulation, load forecasting is critical for the stable operation of power systems. Machine learning methods prevail in this field. However, the limited training data can be a challenge. This paper proposes a generative model-assisted approach for load forecasting under small sample scenarios, consisting of two steps: expanding the dataset using a diffusion-based generative model and then training various machine learning regressors on the augmented dataset to identify the best performer. The expanded dataset significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to the original dataset, and the diffusion model outperforms the generative adversarial model by achieving about 200 times smaller errors and better alignment in latent data distributions.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-Theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic, Battery, and Grid Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Sang, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Solar PV and battery storage systems have become integral to modern power grids. Therefore, bulk grid models in real-time operation must include their physical behavior accurately for analysis and optimization. AC state estimation is critical to building real-time bulk power systems models. However, current ACSE techniques do not include detailed physics and measurements for battery and PV systems. This results in sub-optimal estimation results and subsequent less accurate bulk grid models for real-time operation. To address these challenges, we formulate a circuit-theoretic AC state estimator with accurate PV and battery systems physics and corresponding measurements. First, we propose an aggregated equivalent circuit model of the solar PV, battery, and traditional grid components. Next, we add measurements from PV and battery systems to the traditional measurement set to facilitate accurate estimation of the overall grid model. Finally, we develop a circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm that can accurately estimate grid, PV, and battery system states and is robust against erroneous parameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we estimate the states of 10k node transmission networks with hundreds of battery+PV-tied systems. We compare the accuracy against the estimation of stand-alone grid, battery, and PV systems.</p>

            <p>Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Zero-Shot Capability of Time-Series Foundation Models in Short-Term Load Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Lin, Dong Yun, Weijie Xia, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.Vivienne Liu, Vivek Srikrishnan, Kenji Doering, Elnaz Kabir, Scott Steinschneider, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</p>
