            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <h2>Online Low-Carbon Workload, Energy, and Temperature Management of Distributed Data Centers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng</p>
            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative ISAC-empowered Low-Altitude Economy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Tang, Yiming Yu, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <h2>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Mobile Edge Computing via Large Language Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <h2>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanting Lyu, Songjie Yang, Yue Xiu, Zhongpei Zhang, Chadi Assi, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <p>Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at this https URL</p>

To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties.

Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge.

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng</p>
            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Tang, Yiming Yu, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything.

In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p>We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</p>

According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position.

            <p>We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng</p>
            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything. Meanwhile, MA utilizes the spatial variations of wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the positions of MA elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve the channel and further enhance the performance of the ISAC systems. In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone.

            <h2>Improving diabetic retinopathy screening using Artificial Intelligence: design, evaluation and before-and-after study of a custom development</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imanol Pinto, Álvaro Olazarán, David Jurío, Borja de la Osa, Miguel Sainz, Aritz Oscoz, Jerónimo Ballaz, Javier Gorricho, Mikel Galar, José Andonegui</p>
            <p>Background: The worst outcomes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be prevented by implementing DR screening programs assisted by AI. At the University Hospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus images in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening level (ophthalmologist) target patients. Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom AI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper introduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique combination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its impact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares 19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients screened after. Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing their sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for non-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\% to 86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in most of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them as referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study visualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of sight-threatening DR referred by a GP. Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which could be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening. This shows how AI devices, when seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, can help improve clinical pathways in the long term.</p>

            <h2>Co-optimization of Vehicle Dynamics and Powertrain Management for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongtan Li, Yunli Shao</p>
            <p>Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) represent the future of transportation, utilizing detailed traffic information to enhance control and decision-making. Eco-driving of CAVs has the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency, and the benefits are maximized when both vehicle speed and powertrain operation are optimized. In this paper, we studied the co-optimization of vehicle speed and powertrain management for energy savings in a dual-motor electric vehicle. Control-oriented vehicle dynamics and electric powertrain models were developed to transform the problem into an optimal control problem specifically designed to facilitate real-time computation.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>The growing threats of uncertainties, anomalies, and cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry-standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non-actionable results. Estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge. This thesis addresses robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm -- Physics-ML Synergy -- which integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats, pinpointing dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimizations to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by interconnecting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML.</p>

            <p>To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</p>

            <h2>Improving diabetic retinopathy screening using Artificial Intelligence: design, evaluation and before-and-after study of a custom development</h2>

            <p>Background: The worst outcomes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be prevented by implementing DR screening programs assisted by AI. At the University Hospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus images in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening level (ophthalmologist) target patients. Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom AI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper introduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique combination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its impact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares 19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients screened after. Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing their sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for non-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\% to 86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in most of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them as referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study visualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of sight-threatening DR referred by a GP. Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which could be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening. This shows how AI devices, when seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, can help improve clinical pathways in the long term.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akram Shafie, Jinhong Yuan, Nan Yang, Hai Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the time-frequency (TF) localization characteristics of the prototype pulse of orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing modulation, namely, the DD plane orthogonal pulse (DDOP). The TF localization characteristics examine how concentrated or spread out the energy of a pulse is in the joint TF domain, the time domain (TD), and the frequency domain (FD). We first derive the TF localization metrics of the DDOP, including its TF area, its time and frequency dispersions, and its direction parameter. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the DDOP exhibits a high energy spread in the TD, FD, and the joint TF domain, while adhering to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thereafter, we discuss the potential advantages brought by the energy spread of the DDOP, especially with regard to harnessing both time and frequency diversities and enabling fine-resolution sensing. Subsequently, we examine the relationships between the time and frequency dispersions of the DDOP and those of the envelope functions of DDOP's TD and FD representations, paving the way for simplified determination of the TF localization metrics for more generalized variants of the DDOP and the pulses used in other DD domain modulation schemes. Finally, using numerical results, we validate our analysis and find further insights.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading communication performance. Existing hybrid precoding designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware hybrid precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware to enhance integrated gain. We introduce a squint-aware optimization-based hybrid precoding algorithm (SA-Opt) and develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</p>

            <p>Asset tracking solutions have proven their significance in industrial contexts, as evidenced by their successful commercialization (e.g., Hilti On!Track). However, a seamless solution for matching assets with their users, such as operators of construction power tools, is still missing. By enabling assetuser matching, organizations gain valuable insights that can be used to optimize user health and safety, asset utilization, and maintenance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this gap by leveraging existing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed framework comprises the following components: i) a wearable device, ii) an IoT device attached to or embedded in the assets, iii) an algorithm to estimate the distance between assets and operators by exploiting simple received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and iv) a cloud-based algorithm that collects all estimated distances to derive the correct asset-operator matching. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through indoor and outdoor experiments in a construction setting for identifying the operator of a power tool. A physical prototype was developed to evaluate the algorithms in a realistic setup. The results demonstrated a median accuracy of 0.49m in estimating the distance between assets and users, and up to 98.6% in correctly matching users with their assets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alva Kosasih, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson</p>
            <p>A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) alters the reflection of incoming signals based on the phase-shift configuration assigned to its elements. This feature can be used to improve the signal strength for user equipments (UEs), expand coverage, and enhance spectral efficiency in wideband communication systems. Having accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable to realize the full potential of RIS-aided wideband systems. Unfortunately, CSI is challenging to acquire due to the passive nature of the RIS elements, which cannot perform transmit/receive signal processing. Recently, a parametric maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimator has been developed and demonstrated excellent estimation accuracy. However, this estimator is designed for narrowband systems with no non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we develop a novel parametric ML channel estimator for RIS-assisted wideband systems, which can handle line-of-sight (LOS) paths in the base station (BS)-RIS and RIS-UE links as well as NLOS paths between the UE, BS, and RIS. We leverage the reduced subspace representation induced by the array geometry to suppress noise in unused dimensions, enabling accurate estimation of the NLOS paths. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates superior estimation performance for the BS-UE and RIS-UE channels, outperforming the existing ML channel estimator.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enea Figini, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Large District Heating System Models Using Open-Source Data and Tools: An Exemplary Workflow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Stock, Till Schmidt, André Xhonneux, Dirk Müller</p>
            <p>District heating (DH) systems play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the building sector's heat supply. While innovative low-exergy DH and cooling systems are increasingly adopted in new developments, the transformation of existing DH systems remains critical, as many still depend on fossil-based heating plants. Achieving a sustainable heat supply necessitates integrating renewable energy and waste heat sources into current DH systems and enhancing operational efficiency through measures such as reduced supply temperatures and advanced control algorithms. These improvements can reduce costs and CO2 emissions but may require infrastructure adaptations, including pipe replacements and building-level system adjustments. This paper introduces a workflow for generating DH models using publicly available data and open-source tools. Such models enable comprehensive analyses of existing DH systems, allowing for the evaluation of sustainable heat integration, operational improvements, and the testing of analytical tools, such as simulation and optimization models. The workflow, detailed in this study, combines general structural data with computational estimations to create digital representations of DH systems. These models facilitate scenario-based analyses, tool benchmarking, and the identification of necessary infrastructure adaptations. Two example DH models generated using the proposed workflow are presented, followed by a discussion of the methodology's applicability and limitations.

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</p>

            <h2>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingzhu Wen, Yong Zhou, Xiaoyang Li, Yuanming Shi, Kaibin Huang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p>

            <h2>RIS-aided Wireless-Powered Backscatter Communications for Sustainable Internet of Underground Things</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiang Lin, Yijie Mao</p>
            <p>Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</p>

            <h2>Generative Modeling and Data Augmentation for Power System Production Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>As a key component of power system production simulation, load forecasting is critical for the stable operation of power systems. Machine learning methods prevail in this field. However, the limited training data can be a challenge. This paper proposes a generative model-assisted approach for load forecasting under small sample scenarios, consisting of two steps: expanding the dataset using a diffusion-based generative model and then training various machine learning regressors on the augmented dataset to identify the best performer. The expanded dataset significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to the original dataset, and the diffusion model outperforms the generative adversarial model by achieving about 200 times smaller errors and better alignment in latent data distributions.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-Theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic, Battery, and Grid Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Sang, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Solar PV and battery storage systems have become integral to modern power grids. Therefore, bulk grid models in real-time operation must include their physical behavior accurately for analysis and optimization. AC state estimation is critical to building real-time bulk power systems models. However, current ACSE techniques do not include detailed physics and measurements for battery and PV systems. This results in sub-optimal estimation results and subsequent less accurate bulk grid models for real-time operation. To address these challenges, we formulate a circuit-theoretic AC state estimator with accurate PV and battery systems physics and corresponding measurements. First, we propose an aggregated equivalent circuit model of the solar PV, battery, and traditional grid components. Next, we add measurements from PV and battery systems to the traditional measurement set to facilitate accurate estimation of the overall grid model. Finally, we develop a circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm that can accurately estimate grid, PV, and battery system states and is robust against erroneous parameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we estimate the states of 10k node transmission networks with hundreds of battery+PV-tied systems. We compare the accuracy against the estimation of stand-alone grid, battery, and PV systems.</p>

            <p>Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Zero-Shot Capability of Time-Series Foundation Models in Short-Term Load Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Lin, Dong Yun, Weijie Xia, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.Vivienne Liu, Vivek Srikrishnan, Kenji Doering, Elnaz Kabir, Scott Steinschneider, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</p>
