            <h2>Compositional and Equilibrium-Free Conditions for Power System Stability -- Part I: Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Yang, Xiaoyu Peng, Xi Ru, Hua Geng, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Traditional centralized stability analysis struggles with scalability in large complex modern power grids. This two-part paper proposes a compositional and equilibrium-free approach to analyzing power system stability. In Part I, we prove that using equilibrium-free local conditions we can certificate system-wide stability of power systems with heterogeneous nonlinear devices and structure-preserving lossy networks. This is built on a recently developed notion of delta dissipativity, which yields local stability conditions without knowing the system-wide equilibrium. As a consequence, our proposed theory can certificate stability of equilibria set rather than single equilibrium. In Part I, we verify our theory and demonstrate promising implications by the single machine single load benchmark, which helps to better explain the compositional and equilibrium-set-oriented stability analysis. Part II of this paper will provide methods for applying our theory to complex power grids, together with case studies across a wide range of system scales. Our results enable a more scalable and adaptable approach to stability analysis. It also sheds light on how to regulate grid-connected devices to guarantee system-wide stability.</p>

            <h2>Compositional and Equilibrium-Free Conditions for Power System Stability -- Part II: Method and Application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Yang, Yifan Su, Xiaoyu Peng, Hua Geng, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>This two-part paper proposes a compositional and equilibrium-free approach to analyzing power system stability. In Part I, we have established the stability theory and proposed stability conditions based on the delta dissipativity. In Part II, we focus on methods for applying our theory to complex power grids. We first propose a method to verify the local condition, i.e., delta dissipativity, for heterogeneous devices in power systems. Then, we propose a method to verify the coupling condition based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we investigate three applications of our theory including stability assessment toward multiple equilibria, stability assessment under varying operating conditions, and a distributed computing framework. Case studies on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus benchmarks well verified our theory and methods.</p>

            <h2>Energy Efficiency Optimization of Finite Block Length STAR-RIS-aided MU-MIMO Broadcast Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Soleymani, Ignacio Santamaria, Eduard Jorswieck, Robert Schober, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>Energy-efficient designs are proposed for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BC), assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) operating at finite block length (FBL). In particular, we maximize the sum energy efficiency (EE), showing that STAR-RIS can substantially enhance it. Our findings demonstrate that the gains of employing STAR-RIS increase when the codeword length and the maximum tolerable bit error rate decrease, meaning that a STAR-RIS is more energy efficient in a system with more stringent latency and reliability requirements.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Virtual Power Plants with Robust Frequency Regulation Capability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhu, Hua Geng, Hongyang Qing, Guangchun (Grant)Ruan, Xiuqiang He</p>
            <p>The rapid integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into power systems has identified frequency security challenges due to reduced inertia and increased load volatility. This paper proposes a robust power reserve decision-making approach for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) to address these challenges, especially under temporally sequential and uncertain disturbances. An analytical model is developed to characterize the system's frequency response dynamics, enabling the quantification of virtual inertia and virtual damping requirements to meet rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), frequency nadir, and steady-state deviation constraints. By analytically deriving the regulation power dynamics, the required virtual inertia and damping parameters for the DVPP are determined in a robust way. Then, the total power reserve decision is made by optimally allocating the parameters and calculating the actual power reserves for IBRs, fully considering their economic diversity. Finally, case studies conducted on an IEEE nine-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate the high reliability of the proposed approach in ensuring frequency security.</p>

            <h2>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 61.4% of Brazil's total generation in 2024 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, inflow forecasting plays a critical role in the operation, planning, and market in this country, as well as in any other hydro-dependent power system. These forecasts influence generation schedules, reservoir management, and market pricing, shaping the dynamics of the entire electricity sector. The objective of this paper is to measure and present empirical evidence of a systematic optimistic bias in the official inflow forecast methodology, which is based on the PAR(p)-A model. Additionally, we discuss possible sources of this bias and recommend ways to mitigate it. By analyzing 14 years of historical data from the Brazilian system through rolling-window multistep (out-of-sample) forecasts, results indicate that the official forecast model exhibits statistically significant biases of 6%, 14%, 20%, and 24% for 1-, 6-, 12-, and 24-step-ahead forecasts in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 81%, and 109% in the Northeast subsystem. These findings uncover the limitations of current inflow forecasting methodologies used in Brazil and call for new governance and monitoring policies.</p>

            <h2>Model Predictive Control-Based Optimal Energy Management of Autonomous Electric Vehicles Under Cold Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanthan Kumar Padisala, Satadru Dey</p>
            <p>In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.</p>

            <h2>Energy Aware Camera Location Search Algorithm for Increasing Precision of Observation in Automated Manufacturing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongfei Li, Francis Assadian</p>
            <p>Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.</p>

            <h2>Predictive control of wastewater treatment plants as energy-autonomous water resource recovery facilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Otacilio B. L. Neto, Michela Mulas, Iiro Harjunkoski, Francesco Corona</p>
            <p>This work proposes an automatic control solution for the operation of conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as energy-autonomous water resource recovery facilities. We first conceptualize a classification of the quality of treated water for three resource recovery applications (environmental, industrial, and agricultural water reuse). We then present an output-feedback model predictive controller (Output MPC) that operates a plant to produce water of specific quality class, while also producing sufficient biogas to ensure nonpositive energy costs. The controller is demonstrated in the long-term operation of a full-scale WWTP subjected to typical influent loads and periodically changing quality targets. Our results provide a proof-of-concept on the energy-autonomous operation of existing wastewater treatment infrastructure with control strategies that are general enough to accommodate a wide range of resource recovery objectives.</p>

            <h2>A Robust Optimization Framework for Flexible Industrial Energy Scheduling: Application to a Cement Plant with Market Participation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastián Rojas-Innocenti, Enrique Baeyens, Alejandro Martín-Crespo, Sergio Saludes-Rodil, Fernando Frechoso Escudero</p>
            <p>This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility, the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial flexibility planning under uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>General Reference Frame Identification and Transformation in Unbalanced Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco G. Montoya, Santiago Sánchez Acevedo</p>
            <p>Various domains such as power system stability analysis, electric machine modeling, and control of power electronic converters have significantly benefited from the application of coordinate transformations. One of the main benefits is the dimensional reduction, which reduces the complexity of the problems. This paper introduces a novel general transformation based on a geometric framework that directly identifies the plane containing the locus for unbalanced quantities through bivector analysis using Geometric Algebra. The proposed method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems. The transformation requires only two measurements (voltage or current) taken at different time instants, making it computationally efficient. Moreover, we demonstrate through pure geometric reasoning that our approach is general and encompasses other techniques, such as the classical Clarke transformation. Numerical simulations and experimental validation using a real-time digital simulator and a physical laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This generalization to multi-dimensional systems, combined with the reduced measurement requirements, represents a significant advancement over existing approaches that are typically restricted to three-phase applications or suffer from computational limitations.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Voltage Control Using Online Exponential Barrier Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhang, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper address the optimal voltage control problem of distribution systems with high penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources, under inaccurate model information. We propose the online exponential barrier method that explicitly leverages the online feedback from grids to enhance the robustness to model inaccuracy and incorporates the voltage constraints to maintain the safety requirements. We provide analytical results on the optimal barrier parameter selection and sufficient conditions for the safety guarantee of converged voltages. We also establish theoretical results on the exponential convergence rate with proper step-size. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 56-bus radial network, where we significantly improve the robustness against model inaccuracy compared to existing methods.</p>

            <h2>Large Language Models-Empowered Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Architecture, and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Latif U. Khan, Maher Guizani, Sami Muhaidat, Choong Seon Hong</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime, large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely, \emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.</p>

            <h2>Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</p>

            <h2>Energy efficiency of DMAs vs. conventional MIMO: a sensitivity analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Ramírez-Espinosa, David Morales-Jiménez, Beatriz Soret</p>
            <p>Motivated by the stringent and challenging need for `greener communications' in increasingly power-hungry 5G networks, this paper presents a detailed energy efficiency analysis for three different multi-antenna architectures, namely fully-digital arrays, hybrid arrays, and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). By leveraging a circuital model, which captures mutual coupling, insertion losses, propagation through the waveguides in DMAs and other electromagnetic phenomena, we design a transmit Wiener filter solution for the three systems. We then use these results to analyze the energy efficiency, considering different consumption models and supplied power, and with particular focus on the impact of the physical phenomena. DMAs emerge as an efficient alternative to classical arrays across diverse tested scenarios, most notably under low transmission power, strong coupling, and scalability requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Aboudonia, Johannes Estermann, Keith Moffat, Manfred Morari, John Lygeros</p>
            <p>We aim to improve the energy efficiency of train climate control architectures, with a focus on a specific class of regional trains operating throughout Switzerland, especially in Zurich and Geneva. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represent the second largest energy consumer in these trains after traction. The current architecture comprises a high-level rule-based controller and a low-level tracking controller. To improve train energy efficiency, we propose adding a middle data-driven predictive control layer aimed at minimizing HVAC energy consumption while maintaining passenger comfort. The scheme incorporates a multistep prediction model developed using real-world data collected from a limited number of train coaches. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we conduct multiple experiments on a separate set of train coaches; our results suggest energy savings between 10% and 35% with respect to the current architecture.</p>

            <p>Electrified transportation leads to a tighter integration between transportation and energy distribution systems. In this work, we develop scalable optimization models to co-design hydrogen and battery electric vehicle (EV) fleets, distributed energy resources, and fast-charging and hydrogen-fueling infrastructure to efficiently meet transportation demands. A novel integer-clustering formulation is used for optimizing fleet-level EV operation while maintaining accurate individual vehicle dispatch, which significantly improves the computation efficiency with guaranteed performance. We apply the optimization model to Boston's public transit bus network using real geospatial data and cost parameters. Realistic insights are provided into the future evolution of coupled electricity-transportation-hydrogen systems, including the effects of electricity price structure, hydrogen fuel cost, carbon emission constraint, temperature effects on EV range, and distribution system upgrade cost.</p>

Besides, advances in gas-electricity system integration, including modeling, scheduling, planning and market design, are reviewed respectively. Then, the potential for cross-system fault propagation is highlighted, and practical methods for safety analysis and control are proposed.

            <h2>Vulnerability-Based Optimal Grid Defense Strategies for Enhancing Cyber-Physical Energy System Resilience</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Tönges, Philipp Härtel, Martin Braun</p>
            <p>An approach is proposed to identify optimal asset protection strategies based on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Traditional bilevel attacker-defender models emphasize worstcase scenarios but offer limited defensive guidance. In contrast, trilevel models introduce high computational complexity and rely on fixed network configurations. The proposed critical-components method leverages vulnerability assessment results to determine protection strategies, effectively outsourcing the upper-level defense decision. This enables adaptability to diverse network topologies, assessment techniques, and cyber-physical energy systems without the overhead of multi-level optimization. Case studies demonstrate the potential for improved system resilience across varying operational conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asad Mahmood, Thang X. Vu, Wali Ullah Khan, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten</p>
            <p>This work proposes a framework for the robust design of UAV-assisted wireless networks that combine 3D trajectory optimization with user mobility prediction to address dynamic resource allocation challenges. We proposed a sparse second-order prediction model for real-time user tracking coupled with heuristic user clustering to balance service quality and computational complexity. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum rate. It is then decomposed into user association, 3D trajectory design, and resource allocation subproblems, which are solved iteratively via successive convex approximation (SCA). Extensive simulations demonstrate: (1) near-optimal performance with $\epsilon \approx 0.67\%$ deviation from upper-bound solutions, (2) $16\%$ higher minimum rates for distant users compared to non-predictive 3D designs, and (3) $10-30\%$ faster outage mitigation than time-division benchmarks. The framework's adaptive speed control enables precise mobile user tracking while maintaining energy efficiency under constrained flight time. Results demonstrate superior robustness in edge-coverage scenarios, making it particularly suitable for $5G/6G$ networks.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.</p>

            <p>The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential for enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or predetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement Learning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile loco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving a success rate of 78.9% on average.

            <h2>Sensor Fusion for Track Geometry Monitoring: Integrating On-Board Data and Degradation Models via Kalman Filtering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huy Truong-Ba, Jacky Chin, Michael E. Cholette, Pietro Borghesani</p>
            <p>Track geometry monitoring is essential for maintaining the safety and efficiency of railway operations. While Track Recording Cars (TRCs) provide accurate measurements of track geometry indicators, their limited availability and high operational costs restrict frequent monitoring across large rail networks. Recent advancements in on-board sensor systems installed on in-service trains offer a cost-effective alternative by enabling high-frequency, albeit less accurate, data collection. This study proposes a method to enhance the reliability of track geometry predictions by integrating low-accuracy sensor signals with degradation models through a Kalman filter framework. An experimental campaign using a low-cost sensor system mounted on a TRC evaluates the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that incorporating frequent sensor data significantly reduces prediction uncertainty, even when the data is noisy. The study also investigates how the frequency of data recording influences the size of the credible prediction interval, providing guidance on the optimal deployment of on-board sensors for effective track monitoring and maintenance planning.</p>

            <h2>Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Zapparoli, Alfredo Oneto, María Parajeles Herrera, Blazhe Gjorgiev, Gabriela Hug, Giovanni Sansavini</p>
            <p>The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050.

            <h2>Quantitative Indices for Improving Metro Load Curve, Using Distributed Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Behbahani, Alireza Fereidunian</p>
            <p>This paper promises the idea of using DG (Distributed Generation) to improve the Metro load curve. Public transportation systems are often based on gasoline and diesel. However, with the gradual development in usage of the Metro and monorail, a new load with heavy demand, inappropriate load curve and middle LF (Load factor) is added to the electricity grid. In addition to supply problem of this massive consumer, the Metro load curve is another problem, which has a relatively low LF. Furthermore, Metro load peak hours coincide with the peaks of national grid. Improvement of the load curve is well-known in electrical engineering literature, which depending on the type of load curve, offers general recommendations in three approaches; DSM (Demand Side Management), DS (Distributed Storage) and DG. In this paper, to achieve quantitative indices of improvement for Metro load curve using DG, firstly based on the analysis of volume and consumption pattern of the main loads in Metro, the typical load curve has been extracted. Using this curve, the result of using DG is shown by quantitative parameters which represent the significant improvement in load curve. These parameters can be used to calculate economic indicators such as initial cost and ROI (Return of Investment).</p>

            <h2>Distributed component-level modeling and control of energy dynamics in electric power systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiya Gada, Rupamathi Jaddivada, Marija Ilic</p>
            <p>The widespread deployment of power electronic-based technologies is transforming modern power systems into fast, nonlinear, and heterogeneous systems. Conventional modeling and control approaches, rooted in quasi-static analysis and centralized control, are inadequate for these converter-dominated systems, which operate on fast timescales and involve proprietary models of diverse components. This paper adopts and extends a previously introduced energy space modeling framework grounded in energy conservation principles to address these challenges. We generalize the notion of a port interaction variable, which encodes energy exchange between interconnected, heterogeneous components in a unified and physically intuitive manner. A multilayered distributed control architecture is proposed, wherein the nonlinear physical dynamics of each component are lifted to a higher-level linear energy space through well-defined mappings. Distributed controllers are designed in this energy space using only local states and minimal neighbor information via port interaction variables. Two control designs, energy-based feedback linearizing control (FBLC) and sliding mode control (SMC), are proven to achieve asymptotic convergence to reference outputs. The approach is validated on two systems: an inverter-controlled RLC circuit and a synchronous generator connected to a load. In both cases, energy-based control improves transient response and reduces control effort.</p>

            <h2>Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA) for Enabled Flexible PONs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Lian, Xiao Han, Xinmao Deng</p>
            <p>With the commercial deployment of 5G and the in-depth research of 6G, the demand for high-speed data services in the next-generation fiber optic access systems is growing increasingly. Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a research hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and low cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has difficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high spectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission technology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access (PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the low-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the high-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing the system capacity. PD-SDCMA supports higher-order modulation formats and more access groups, and is also compatible with the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture. The simulation results show that in a 25 km single-mode fiber system, compared with PD-NOMA and 3D-NOMA, PD-SDCMA can support more users and significantly reduce BER. This technology provides an efficient and low-cost solution for the evolution of Flexible PONs.</p>

            <h2>Atmospheric Density-Compensating Model Predictive Control for Targeted Reentry of Drag-Modulated Spacecraft</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex D. Hayes, Ryan J. Caverly</p>
            <p>This paper presents an estimation and control framework that enables the targeted reentry of a drag-modulated spacecraft in the presence of atmospheric density uncertainty. In particular, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the in-flight density errors relative to the atmospheric density used to generate the nominal guidance trajectory. This information is leveraged within a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to improve tracking performance, reduce control effort, and increase robustness to actuator saturation compared to the state-of-the-art approach. The estimation and control framework is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation campaign with historical space weather data. These simulation efforts demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to stay within 100 km of the guidance trajectory at all points in time for 98.4% of cases. The remaining 1.6% of cases were pushed away from the guidance by large density errors, many due to significant solar storms and flares, that could not physically be compensated for by the drag control device. For the successful cases, the proposed framework was able to guide the spacecraft to the desired location at the entry interface altitude with a mean error of 12.1 km and 99.7% of cases below 100 km.</p>

            <h2>Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review</h2>

            <p>A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. Here we review 24 papers that document field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl-Ludwig Besser, Rafael F. Schaefer, H. Vincent Poor</p>
            <p>Resilience and power consumption are two important performance metrics for many modern communication systems, and it is therefore important to define, analyze, and optimize them. In this work, we consider a wireless communication system with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to and used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer resilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we propose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between resilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare constant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a reinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can be minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can be used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters for the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.</p>

            <h2>Meta-analysis of Life Cycle Assessments for Li-Ion Batteries Production Emissions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maurizio Clemente, Prapti Maharjan, Mauro Salazar, Theo Hofman</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the environmental impact of Li-Ion batteries by quantifying manufacturing-related emissions and analyzing how electricity mix and production scale affect emission intensity. To this end, we conduct a meta-analysis of life cycle assessments on lithium-ion batteries published over the past two decades, categorizing them by year, battery chemistry, functional unit, system boundaries, and electricity mix. We then carry out a cradle-to-gate assessment for a nickel manganese cobalt 811 battery with a silicon-coated graphite anode, analyzing how variations in the carbon intensity of the electricity mix affect emissions, with case studies for China, South Korea, and Sweden. Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link annual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix to the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis shows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with a standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence emissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode material processing. We found that a multivariate linear regression using production volume and the carbon intensity of the Chinese electricity mix as predictors explains emissions with moderate accuracy. The environmental impact of battery manufacturing can be reduced by using clean energy sources in production processes. However, achieving substantial reductions requires clean energy throughout the entire supply chain, as importing materials from regions with carbon-intensive electricity mixes can undermine these efforts. Our findings also highlight the emission-reducing effect of learning associated with increased production scale, supporting the integration of learning effects in future life cycle assessment models.</p>

            <p>With the rapid advancement of intelligent technologies, collaborative frameworks integrating large and small models have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing industrial maintenance. However, several challenges persist, including limited domain adaptability, insufficient real-time performance and reliability, high integration complexity, and difficulties in knowledge representation and fusion. To address these issues, an intelligent maintenance framework for industrial scenarios is proposed. This framework adopts a five-layer architecture and integrates the precise computational capabilities of domain-specific small models with the cognitive reasoning, knowledge integration, and interactive functionalities of large language models. The objective is to achieve more accurate, intelligent, and efficient maintenance in industrial applications. Two realistic implementations, involving the maintenance of telecommunication equipment rooms and the intelligent servicing of energy storage power stations, demonstrate that the framework significantly enhances maintenance efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darío Slaifstein (1), Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli (1), Laura Ramirez-Elizondo (1), Pavol Bauer (1) ((1) Delft University of Technology)</p>
            <p>In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to the nonlinear device dynamics, uncertainty, and computational issues. As such, energy management systems seek to decide set points for the primary control layer in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). This paper presents a novel aging-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings. The proposed energy management algorithm incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut-down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or static packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25\% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced, with respect to the benchmarks.</p>

            <h2>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur</p>
            <p>The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</p>

            <h2>NILMFormer: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring that Accounts for Non-Stationarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Petralia, Philippe Charpentier, Youssef Kadhi, Themis Palpanas</p>
            <p>Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches. Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's (Electricité De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power consumption.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guozhen Zhu, Yuqian Hu, Chenshu Wu, Wei-Hsiang Wang, Beibei Wang, K. J. Ray Liu</p>
            <p>WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi sensing in real-world environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyi Duan, Jiageng Chen, Zuyuan He</p>
            <p>Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a transformative approach for distributed vibration measurement with high spatial resolution and long measurement range while maintaining cost-efficiency. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal DAS signals present analytical challenges. The abstract signal morphology lacking intuitive physical correspondence complicates human interpretation, and its unique spatial-temporal coupling renders conventional image processing methods suboptimal. This study investigates spatial-temporal characteristics and proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns signals' representations through a mask-reconstruction task. This framework is named the DAS Masked AutoEncoder (DAS-MAE). The DAS-MAE learns high-level representations (e.g., event class) without using labels. It achieves up to 1% error and 64.5% relative improvement (RI) over the semi-supervised baseline in few-shot classification tasks. In a practical external damage prevention application, DAS-MAE attains a 5.0% recognition error, marking a 75.7% RI over supervised training from scratch. These results demonstrate the high-performance and universal representations learned by the DAS-MAE framework, highlighting its potential as a foundation model for analyzing massive unlabeled DAS signals.</p>

            <p>The impedances of cables and lines used in (multi-conductor) distribution networks are usually unknown or approximated, and may lead to problematic results for any physics-based power system calculation, e.g., (optimal) power flow. Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.</p>

Our approach introduces hourly to daily scaling factor mappings to parameterize the aggregated EV units. Compared to simple aggregation methods, the proposed framework reduces the root-mean-square error of charging power by 78~per cent, providing more accurate flexibility representations.

            <h2>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiza Ribeiro, Alexandre Street, Jose Manuel Arroyo, Rodrigo Moreno</p>
            <p>The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</p>

A case study with simulated home loads, solar generation, and electric vehicle charging profiles demonstrates that joint, or shared, optimization reduces consumer bills by 56% and transformer aging by 48% compared to individual optimization. Hybrid and dynamic optimization schemes that provide owners with autonomy have similar transformer aging reduction but are slightly less cost-effective. These results suggest that controlling shared batteries with virtualization is an effective way to delay transformer upgrades in the face of growing residential electric vehicle charging penetration.</p>

DISH is a domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime system designed to schedule complex imaging workloads on low-power and memory-constrained processors. Our experiments demonstrate that DIPP's decomposition of the processing pipelines adds negligible overhead, while significantly reducing the network requirements of updating pipelines and being robust against erroneous module uploads.

            <p>This paper presents a \textit{physics-based} steady-state equivalent circuit model of a two-stage bidirectional inverter. These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses, ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power, and iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose a physics-first model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components based on circuit-level principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muratkhan Abdirash, Xiaofan Cui</p>
            <p>A DC microgrid is a promising alternative to the traditional AC power grid, since it can efficiently integrate distributed and renewable energy resources. However, as an emerging framework, it lacks the rigorous theoretical guarantees of its AC counterpart. In particular, safe stabilization of the DC microgrid has been a non-trivial task in power electronics. To address that, we take a control theoretic perspective in designing the feedback controller with provable guarantees. We present a systematic way to construct Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF) to stabilize the microgrid, and, independently, Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to enforce its safe operation at all times. The safety-critical controller (SCC) proposed in this work integrates the two control objectives, with safety prioritized, into a quadratic program (QP) as linear constraints, which allows for its online deployment using off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers. The SCC is compared against a robust version of the conventional droop control through numerical experiments whose results indicate the SCC outperforms the droop controller in guaranteeing safety and retaining stability at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Topology-Aware Graph Neural Network-based State Estimation for PMU-Unobservable Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Moshtagh, Behrouz Azimian, Mohammad Golgol, Anamitra Pal</p>
            <p>Traditional optimization-based techniques for time-synchronized state estimation (SE) often suffer from high online computational burden, limited phasor measurement unit (PMU) coverage, and presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Although conventional learning-based models have been developed to overcome these challenges, they are negatively impacted by topology changes and real-time data loss. This paper proposes a novel deep geometric learning approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate the states of PMU-unobservable power systems. The proposed approach combines graph convolution and multi-head graph attention layers inside a customized end-to-end learning framework to handle topology changes and real-time data loss. An upper bound on SE error as a function of topology change is also derived. Experimental results for different test systems demonstrate superiority of the proposed customized GNN-SE (CGNN-SE) over traditional optimization-based techniques as well as conventional learning-based models in presence of topology changes, PMU failures, bad data, non-Gaussian measurement noise, and large system implementation.</p>

            <h2>Spatiotemporal Prediction of Electric Vehicle Charging Load Based on Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Fan, Mingxuan Li, Jingshi Cui, Zuhan Zhang, Wencai Run, Dunnan Liu</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of EVs and the subsequent increase in charging demand pose significant challenges for load grid scheduling and the operation of EV charging stations. Effectively harnessing the spatiotemporal correlations among EV charging stations to improve forecasting accuracy is complex. To tackle these challenges, we propose EV-LLM for EV charging loads based on LLMs in this paper. EV-LLM integrates the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in spatiotemporal feature extraction with the generalization capabilities of fine-tuned generative LLMs. Also, EV-LLM enables effective data mining and feature extraction across multimodal and multidimensional datasets, incorporating historical charging data, weather information, and relevant textual descriptions to enhance forecasting accuracy for multiple charging stations. We validate the effectiveness of EV-LLM by using charging data from 10 stations in California, demonstrating its superiority over the other traditional deep learning methods and potential to optimize load grid scheduling and support vehicle-to-grid interactions.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Transmission Switching: Improving Solver Performance Using Heuristics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Hinneck, David Pozo</p>
            <p>The optimal transmission switching problem (OTSP) is an established problem of changing a power grid's topology to obtain an improved operation by controlling the switching status of transmission lines. This problem was proven to be NP-hard. Proposed solution techniques based on mixed-integer formulations can guarantee globally optimal solutions but are potentially intractable in realistic power grids. Heuristics methods cannot guarantee global optimality but can provide tractable solution approaches. This paper proposes solving the OTSP using exact formulations alongside parallel heuristics that generate good candidate solutions to speed up conventional branch-and-bound algorithms. The innovative aspect of this work is a new asynchronous parallel algorithmic architecture. A solver instance solving the full OTSP formulation is run in parallel to another process that asynchronously generates solutions to be injected into the full OTSP solution procedure during run time. Our method is tested on 14 instances of the pglib-opf library: The largest problem consisting of 13659 buses and 20467 branches. Our results show a good performance for large problem instances, with consistent improvements over off-the-shelf solver performance. We find that the method scales well with an increase in parallel processors.</p>

            <h2>Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive MPC with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Leopoldo Contreras, Ola Shorinwa, Mac Schwager</p>
            <p>We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Coordination of Flexible DERs in Local Energy and Flexibility Markets to Ensure Social Equity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niloofar Pourghaderi, Milad Kabirifar, Payman Dehghanian</p>
            <p>Local electricity markets offer a promising solution for integrating renewable energy sources and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks. These markets enable the effective utilization of flexible resources by facilitating coordination among various agents. Beyond technical and economic considerations, addressing social equity within these local communities is critical and requires dedicated attention in market-clearing frameworks. This paper proposes a social equity-based market-clearing framework for the optimal management of DERs' energy and flexibility within local communities. The proposed framework incorporates consumers' energy burden to ensure fair pricing in energy market clearance. Furthermore, to ensure equity during unbalanced operating conditions, flexible resources are managed in the local flexibility market, ensuring that all participants can trade power fairly under network disturbances. The model is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) optimization and validated on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network.</p>

            <h2>Second-Order-Cone Formulations of Power Flow for Topology Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Rhodes, James Luedkte, Line Roald</p>
            <p>Optimization problems that involve topology optimization in scenarios with large scale outages, such as post-disaster restoration or public safety power shutoff planning, are very challenging to solve. Using simple power flow representations such as DC power flow or network flow models results in low quality solutions which requires significantly higher-than-predicted load shed to become AC feasible. Recent work has shown that formulations based on the Second Order Cone (SOC) power flow formulation find very high quality solutions with low load shed, but the computational burden of these formulations remains a significant challenge. With the aim of reducing computational time while maintaining high solution quality, this work explores formulations which replace the conic constraints with a small number of linear cuts. The goal of this approach is not to find an exact power flow solution, but rather to identify good binary decisions, where the power flow can be resolved after the binary variables are fixed. We find that a simple reformulation of the Second Order Cone Optimal Power Shutoff problem can greatly improve the solution speed, but that a full linearization of the SOC voltage cone equation results in an overestimation of the amount of power that can be delivered to loads.</p>

            <h2>Unit Commitment with Cost-Oriented Temporal Resolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyi Tao, Ran Li, Salvador Pineda</p>
            <p>Time-adaptive unit commitment (UC) has recently been investigated to reduce the scheduling costs by flexibly varying the temporal resolution, which is usually determined by clustering the net load patterns. However, there exists a misalignment between cost and net load patterns due to the discrete start-up costs and out-of-merit-order dispatch triggered by ramping and other constraints. The optimal time-adaptive resolution cannot be completely captured by clustering-based method. This paper proposes a cost-oriented method to address this misalignment by a novel bilevel optimization approach that is efficiently solved through a heuristic greedy algorithm. The impact of varying temporal resolution on the final scheduling costs are tested, based on which the temporal resolution is heuristically updated, achieving significant cost reduction without increasing the number of temporal periods. Subsequently, an improved discretized Adam optimization method together with offline warm start and online refinement strategy is proposed to efficiently search for the better temporal resolution configuration. Results show that the proposed cost-oriented UC temporal resolution determination method achieves enhanced cost efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Net Load Forecasting for High-Penetration RES Grids Utilizing Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixiang Huang, Jianhua Pei, Luocheng Chen, Zhenchang Du, Jinfu Chen, Zirui Peng</p>
            <p>The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES) in modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and accuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

            <p>Despite the impressive performance across a wide range of applications, current computational pathology models face significant diagnostic efficiency challenges due to their reliance on high-magnification whole-slide image analysis. This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with cognitive radio capability to tackle the spectral scarcity problem in wireless communications. Particularly, a cognitive DFRC system operates on a spectrum owned by a primary system to simultaneously perform data communication and target tracking with the condition that its interference to the primary users (PUs) is below a certain threshold. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly design the beamforming vectors for both the radar and communication functions in such a way that the mean square error (MSE) of the beam pattern between the designed and desired waveforms is minimized. The optimization problem has the following three constraints: i) the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each data communication user is above a predetermined level; ii) the per-antenna transmit power is maintained at a given level; iii) the interference imposed on each PU is below a certain threshold. Both the semidefinite relaxation and nature-inspired firefly algorithms are proposed in order to search for the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms can enable the DFRC system to protect the PUs while simultaneously performing its communication and radar functions.</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Enhanced Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Hybrid Client Selection Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhao, Yue Xiu, Chengxiao Dai, Ning Wei, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Large language model (LLM) training in 6G networks faces stringent latency and energy constraints while operating over bandwidth-limited wireless links. A commonly adopted workflow separates training into a centralized pre-training phase and a federated fine-tuning phase on domain-specific data; however, over-the-air (OTA) gradient aggregation during fine-tuning remains vulnerable to fading and interference. This study explores the integration of movable antennas (MAs), whose element positions can be reconfigured in real time, to mitigate such channel impairments. An auxiliary channel representation embeds transmit power terms in the effective gain, thereby removing explicit power-control variables. We derive the convergence bound that determines the relationship between the final fine-tuning loss to OTA noise and the distribution shift between the two data stages, measured via the Wasserstein distance. These findings lead to a mixed integer, nonconvex resource allocation problem that jointly determines the numbers of global rounds, CPU frequencies, mini-batch sizes, positions of MAs, and beamformers under latency-energy constraints. We propose a hybrid successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments with the OpenLLaMA v2 model with 3 billion parameters demonstrate up to $95\%$ faster convergence and over $90\%$ lower total energy consumption relative to the leading wireless federated learning baselines, underscoring the promise of MAs-assisted federated LLM fine-tuning for 6G edge intelligence.</p>

            <p>A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) assisted near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the radio sensors are installed on the STARS to directly conduct the distance-domain sensing by exploiting the characteristic spherical wavefront. A new squared position error bound (SPEB) expression is derived to reveal the dependence on beamforming (BF) design and sensor deployment. To balance the trade-off between the SPEB and the sensor deployment cost, a cost function minimization problem, a cost function minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the sensor deployment, the active and passive BF, subject to communication and power consumption constraints. For the sensor deployment optimization, a joint sensor deployment algorithm is proposed by invoking the successive convex approximation. Under a specific relationship between the sensor numbers and BF design, we derive the optimal sensor interval in a closed-form expression. For the joint BF optimization, a penalty-based method is invoked. Simulation results validated that the derived SPEB expression is close to the exact SPEB, which reveals the Fisher information Matrix of position estimation in NF can be approximated as a diagonal matrix. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms achieve the best SPEB performance than the benchmark schemes accompanying the lowest deployment cost.</p>

            <p>A novel uniform circular array (UCA) based near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the Cylindrical coordinate is invoked to evaluate the joint positioning performance. The joint squared position error bound (SPEB) of the sensing target (ST) is derived for the coplanar and non-coplanar cases. For the coplanar case, where the ST is located in the coplanar region of the UCA, the approximate Cram{é}r-Rao bound (CRB) expressions for the separate angle and distance estimation are given by exploiting the uniform spherical wavefront model. A SPEB minimization problem is formulated with the constraints of communication requirement and power budget, where the closed-form solution to minimize the CRB of the angle is derived. Inspired by the close-form expression, a low complexity vector-based quadratic transformation (VQF) algorithm is proposed by invoking the Rayleigh quotient. For the non-coplanar case, where the ST is located beyond the coplanar region of the UCA, the separate CRBs over three-dimensional coordinates and the joint SPEB approximations are derived. To minimize the SPEB performance, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and extended low-complexity VQF algorithm are proposed. Numerical results validated that i) the Fisher Information Matrix about angle and distance in NF propagation can be approximated as a diagonal matrix with the trinity loss; ii) Compared with the uniform planar array, the UCA achieve better positioning performance when ST located in the coplanar of the antenna array; and iii) the proposed VQF algorithms reach higher solution precision than conventional SDR algorithm with much less computation complexity.</p>

            <p>Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent power levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawang Li</p>
            <p>In this communication, two novel low-cost single-layer filtering antennas (filtennas) are proposed for millimeter wave (mmWave) applications. The proposed filtennas consists of a compact circular substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity, a metal post close to the center of the cavity for power feeding, a metal post in the center for modes controlling, and a slot for radiating power. In the passband, the fundamental TM010 mode and the TM110 mode in the circular SIW cavity are excited by the feeding post. In addition, thanks to the high-pass characteristics of the cavity, it exhibits more than 20 dB suppression in the lower frequency band. There are three radiation nulls in Filtenna 1 and one radiation null in Filtenna 2 in the upper band which increase the suppression level as high as 18 dB. As a proof of concept, the proposed filtennas are fabricated and measured. It is shown that the Filtenna 1 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB impedance fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 7.1% (27.14 - 29.13 GHz) and 8.6% (27.62 - 30.11 GHz), respectively. While filtenna 2 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB FBW of 7.4% (27.86 - 29.99 GHz) and 10.1% (28.11 - 31.09 GHz), respectively. The filtennas features stable radiation patterns with an average gain of 5.0 dBi. The lower and upper sideband suppression levels for both filtennas exceed 18 dB. These filtennas are good candidates for 5G mmWave applications, as they simultaneously provide beam scanning and filtering capability with a low cost, and single layer structure.</p>

Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes.

            <p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource-intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario being generated. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating established parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PPGC) modeling frameworks with generative methods to produce realistic channel matrices with interpretable representations in the parameter domain. We show that generative models converge to prohibitively suboptimal stationary points when learning the underlying prior directly over the parameters due to the non-convex PPGC model. To address this limitation, we propose a linearized reformulation of the problem to ensure smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also providing insights into the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated, scenario-specific samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through its utility when used for downstream compression tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yameng Liu, Jianhua Zhang, Yuxiang Zhang, Hongbo Xing, Yifeng Xiong, Zhiqiang Yuan, Guangyi Liu</p>
            <p>Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G application by ITU and 3GPP, with standardization efforts already underway. Sensing tasks, such as target localization, demand more precise characterization of the sensing target (ST) in ISAC channel modeling. The ST couples complexly with environmental scatterers, potentially blocking some multipaths and generating new ones, resulting in power variations compared to the original channel. To accurately model this effect, this paper proposes a coupled ISAC channel model based on measurements and validates it through similarity analysis between simulated and measured channels. In this work, we first conduct ISAC channel measurements in an indoor factory scenario at 105 GHz, where the multipath power variations caused by the ST's interaction with the environment are clearly observed. Then, we propose an ISAC channel modeling framework that incorporates two novel parameters: the Blockage-Region Coupling Factor (BR-CF) and the Forward-Scattering (FS)-CF, which characterize the spatial region and intensity of the coupling effect, respectively. Finally, the proposed model is validated through similarity comparison with measured data, demonstrating higher accuracy for both LoS and NLoS scenarios compared to the non-coupled model. This realistic ISAC channel model provides an effective framework for capturing the ST-environment coupling effect, supporting the design and evaluation of ISAC technologies.</p>

This non-convex optimization problem is addressed using Bernstein-type inequality (BTI) and alternating optimization (AO) techniques.

We first develop a comprehensive near-field ELAA channel model that accounts for the antenna radiation pattern and free space path loss. Due to the large aperture of the ELAA, the angular resolution of the array is high, which improves user localization accuracy. However, it also makes the user localization problem highly non-convex, posing significant challenges when the number of RF chains is limited. To address this issue, we use an array partitioning strategy to divide the ELAA channel into multiple subarray channels and utilize the geometric constraints between user locations and subarrays for probabilistic modeling. To fully exploit these geometric constraints, we propose the array partitioning-based location estimation with limited measurements (APLE-LM) algorithm based on the message passing principle to achieve multiuser localization. We derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) as the theoretical performance lower bound for our formulated near-field multiuser localization problem. Extensive simulations under various parameter configurations validate the proposed APLE-LM algorithm. The results demonstrate that APLE-LM achieves superior localization accuracy compared to baseline algorithms and approaches the BCRB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</p>

            <h2>HMPC-assisted Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Smart Home Energy Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiadong He, Liang Yu, Zhiqiang Chen, Dawei Qiu, Dong Yue, Goran Strbac, Meng Zhang, Yujian Ye, Yi Wang</p>
            <p>This letter proposes an Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL)-based energy management method for a smart home, which incorporates an implicit thermal dynamics model. In the proposed method, historical optimal decisions are first generated using a neural network-assisted Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (HMPC) framework. These decisions are then used as expert demonstrations in the AIRL module, which aims to train a discriminator to distinguish expert demonstrations from transitions generated by a reinforcement learning agent policy, while simultaneously updating the agent policy that can produce transitions to confuse the discriminator. The proposed HMPC-AIRL method eliminates the need for explicit thermal dynamics models, prior or predictive knowledge of uncertain parameters, or manually designed reward functions. Simulation results based on real-world traces demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Training Beam Design for Channel Estimation in Hybrid mmWave MIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochun Ge, Wenqian Shen, Chengwen Xing, Lian Zhao, Jianping An</p>
            <p>Training beam design for channel estimation with infinite-resolution and low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) in hybrid analog-digital milimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is considered in this paper. By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave channels, the optimization of the sensing matrices (corresponding to training beams) is formulated according to the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Under the condition of infinite-resolution PSs, we propose relevant algorithms to construct the sensing matrix, where the theory of convex optimization and the gradient descent in Riemannian manifold is used to design the digital and analog part, respectively. Furthermore, a block-wise alternating hybrid analog-digital algorithm is proposed to tackle the design of training beams with low-resolution PSs, where the performance degeneration caused by non-convex constant modulus and discrete phase constraints is effectively compensated to some extent thanks to the iterations among blocks. Finally, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based estimator is adopted for achieving an effective recovery of the sparse mmWave channel. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of proposed algorithms compared with some existing schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiarash Hassas Irani, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, Yongwei Huang</p>
            <p>Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) enables enhanced robustness against model uncertainties, such as steering vector mismatches and interference-plus-noise covariance matrix estimation errors. Existing DRO-based RAB methods primarily rely on uncertainty sets characterized by the first- and second-order moments. In this work, we propose a novel Wasserstein DRO-based beamformer, using the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization formulation. The proposed method leverages the Wasserstein metric to define uncertainty sets, offering a data-driven characterization of uncertainty. We show that the choice of the Wasserstein cost function plays a crucial role in shaping the resulting formulation, with norm-based and Mahalanobis-like quadratic costs recovering classical norm-constrained and ellipsoidal robust beamforming models, respectively. This insight highlights the Wasserstein DRO framework as a unifying approach, bridging deterministic and distributionally robust beamforming methodologies.</p>

            <h2>Prediction of the Conditional Probability Densities of Time Interval Extrema for Risk-Sensitive Scheduling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Buyi Yu, Wenyuan Tang</p>
            <p>Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve statistical characterization of peak demand. Extreme Value Analysis (EVA)-based probabilistic assessments of annual peaks are widely adopted by energy regulatory and oversight agencies to determine the likelihood and severity of potential energy shortfalls. Due to the inability of classical EVA to account for peak distributions that change with annual extreme temperatures, popular existing approaches apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monté-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In higher time resolutions such as day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monté-Carlo experiments become intractable, and EVA-based modeling manifests as a methodological vacuum. This article explores uncharted territories and pioneers an unparalleled nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a $38\%$ reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</p>

            <h2>Captivity-Escape Games as a Means for Safety in Online Motion Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Bohn, Manuel Hess, Sören Hohmann</p>
            <p>This paper presents a method that addresses the conservatism, computational effort, and limited numerical accuracy of existing frameworks and methods that ensure safety in online model-based motion generation, commonly referred to as fast and safe tracking. Computational limitations restrict online motion planning to low-fidelity models. However, planning with low-fidelity models compromises safety, as the dynamic feasibility of resulting reference trajectories is not ensured. This potentially leads to unavoidable tracking errors that may cause safety-critical constraint violations. Existing frameworks mitigate this safety risk by augmenting safety-critical constraints in motion planning by a safety margin that prevents constraint violations under worst-case tracking errors. However, the methods employed in these frameworks determine the safety margin based on a heuristically selected performance of the planning model, which likely results in overly conservative reference trajectories. Furthermore, these methods are computationally intensive, and the state-of-the-art method is limited in numerical accuracy. We adopt a different perspective and address these limitations with a method that mitigates conservatism in existing frameworks by adapting the planning model performance to a given safety margin. Our method achieves numerical accuracy and requires significantly less computation time than existing methods by leveraging a captivity-escape game, which is a specific zero-sum differential game formulated in this paper. We demonstrate our method using a numerical example and compare it to the state of the art.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Naeem, Anastassia Gharib, Hüseyin Arslan</p>
            <p>Water-filling (WF) algorithms are pivotal in maximizing capacity and spectral efficiency in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, traditional WF approaches cater solely to communication requirements, neglecting the emerging heterogeneity of 6G, including sensing and joint radar-communication (JRC). As these diverse demands grow in importance and have different Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, traditional WF becomes inadequate. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified interference-aware and QoS-constrained WF algorithm for systems with communication, sensing, and JRC. The proposed algorithm enables power allocation for multi-user MIMO systems, effectively addressing interference and balancing the support for heterogeneous user requirements.</p>

            <p>The major challenges to battery electric truck adoption are their high cost and grid this http URL this context, stationary energy storage systems can help mitigate both issues. Since their design and operation are strongly coupled, to make the best out of them, they should be jointly optimized. This paper presents a co-design framework for hybrid energy storage systems where their technology and sizing are optimized jointly with their operational strategies. Specifically, we consider a microgrid supporting truck chargers that consists of utility grid, solar panels, and energy storage systems including batteries, supercapacitors and flywheels. We frame the co-design problem as a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved with global optimality guarantees. We showcase our framework in a case-study of a distribution center in the Netherlands. Our results show that although the battery-only configuration is already competitive, adding supercapacitors or flywheel storage decrease total cost and increase energy sold back to the grid. Overall, the fully hybrid solution (Battery+Supercapacitors+Flywheel) offers the best outcomes, achieving the lowest overall cost (1.96\% lower compared to battery-only) and reduced grid dependency, but at a higher (2.6\%) initial investment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wang Dai, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen</p>
            <p>We propose a novel approach that utilize inter-speaker relative cues for distinguishing target speakers and extracting their voices from mixtures. Continuous cues (e.g., temporal order, age, pitch level) are grouped by relative differences, while discrete cues (e.g., language, gender, emotion) retain their categories. Relative cues offers greater flexibility than fixed speech attribute classification, facilitating much easier expansion of text-guided target speech extraction datasets. Our experiments show that combining all relative cues yields better performance than random subsets, with gender and temporal order being the most robust across languages and reverberant conditions. Additional cues like pitch level, loudness, distance, speaking duration, language, and pitch range also demonstrate notable benefit in complex scenarios. Fine-tuning pre-trained WavLM Base+ CNN encoders improves overall performance over the baseline of using only a Conv1d encoder.</p>

            <p>We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices. Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised speech representations. Samples and code: this https URL.</p>

            <p>This paper derives the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for continuous-time systems on matrix Lie groups observed through discrete-time measurements. By modeling the system noise on the Lie algebra and adopting a Stratonovich interpretation for the stochastic differential equation (SDE), we ensure that solutions remain on the manifold. The derivation of the filter follows classical EKF principles, naturally integrating a necessary full-order covariance reset post-measurement update. A key contribution is proving that this full-order covariance reset guarantees that the Lie-group-valued state estimate is invariant to whether a left- or right-invariant error definition is used in the EKF. Monte Carlo simulations of the aided inertial navigation problem validate the invariance property and confirm its absence when employing reduced-order covariance resets.</p>

Nourished by the challenge outcomes, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of two key, yet understudied, issues in SE system development: data cleaning and evaluation metrics. We highlight several overlooked problems in traditional SE pipelines: (1) mismatches between declared and effective audio bandwidths, along with label noise even in various "high-quality" speech corpora; (2) lack of both effective SE systems to conquer the hardest conditions (e.g., speech overlap, strong noise / reverberation) and reliable measure of speech sample difficulty; (3) importance of combining multifaceted metrics for a comprehensive evaluation correlating well with human judgment.

            <p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with dysarthric speech due to high inter-speaker variability and slow speaking rates. To address this, we explore dysarthric-to-healthy speech conversion for improved ASR performance. Our approach extends the Rhythm and Voice (RnV) conversion framework by introducing a syllable-based rhythm modeling method suited for dysarthric speech. We assess its impact on ASR by training LF-MMI models and fine-tuning Whisper on converted speech. Experiments on the Torgo corpus reveal that LF-MMI achieves significant word error rate reductions, especially for more severe cases of dysarthria, while fine-tuning Whisper on converted data has minimal effect on its performance. These results highlight the potential of unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion for dysarthric ASR. Code available at: this https URL</p>

            <p>In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have gained traction in home energy management systems. However, their adoption by energy management companies remains limited due to the black-box nature of DRL, which fails to provide transparent decision-making feedback. To address this, explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) techniques have emerged, aiming to make DRL decisions more transparent. Among these, soft differential decision tree (DDT) distillation provides a promising approach due to the clear decision rules they are based on, which can be efficiently computed. However, achieving high performance often requires deep, and completely full, trees, which reduces interpretability. To overcome this, we propose a novel asymmetric soft DDT construction method. Unlike traditional soft DDTs, our approach adaptively constructs trees by expanding nodes only when necessary. This improves the efficient use of decision nodes, which require a predetermined depth to construct full symmetric trees, enhancing both interpretability and performance. We demonstrate the potential of asymmetric DDTs to provide transparent, efficient, and high-performing decision-making in home energy management systems.</p>

            <h2>Self-Supervised Speech Quality Assessment (S3QA): Leveraging Speech Foundation Models for a Scalable Speech Quality Metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mattson Ogg, Caitlyn Bishop, Han Yi, Sarah Robinson</p>
            <p>Methods for automatically assessing speech quality are critical for many human language technologies. Behavioral ratings provided by human raters (e.g., mean opinion scores; MOS) are considered the gold standard, but they are susceptible to variability between individual raters, cannot easily be generalized across corpora, and are labor-intensive to collect, thus limiting the acoustic challenges they can quantify. Here, we present a new, scalable method for automatically assessing speech quality: the self-supervised speech quality assessment (S3QA) model. First, we processed high quality utterances from multiple speech corpora, using a wide range of acoustic manipulations intended to emulate common sources of quality degradation in the real-world: frequency filtering, reverberation, background noise, and digital compression. Second, we leveraged an existing, pre-trained speech foundation model, WavLM, to computationally derive a self-supervised training target for the level of signal degradation by calculating the cosine distances between the clean and degraded versions of each utterance in the embedding space. Next, we trained a transformer-based model to predict the cosine distance, or degradation index, given only the degraded versions of these utterances. Finally, the trained model was evaluated on unseen test corpora of synthetic mixtures, NISQA, and VOiCES. We show that the S3QA model trained on this task performs well and is aligned with both behavioral ratings (MOS), speech technology performance (automatic speech recognition) and other important features of the held-out data (e.g., microphone distances). This approach provides an automated, scalable method for assessing speech quality across a wide range of acoustic challenges, and could easily be adapted to other use cases where acoustic simulations are available.</p>

Our approach employs vertical integration across the architecture, system, and runtime layers, balances operational and embodied carbon emissions while considering EDC performance as a co-optimization objective, rather than a constraint. At the architecture level, we propose carbon-aware and approximate accelerator designs to reduce embodied carbon. At the system level, we enhance resource utilization and adapt to real-time carbon intensity variations to minimize operational emissions. Finally, at the runtime level, we develop dynamic scheduling frameworks that adjust execution, based on energy constraints and carbon intensity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Wehbeh, E. C. Kerrigan</p>
            <p>Robust optimal or min-max model predictive control (MPC) approaches aim to guarantee constraint satisfaction over a known, bounded uncertainty set while minimizing a worst-case performance bound. Traditionally, these methods compute a trajectory that meets the desired properties over a fixed prediction horizon, apply a portion of the resulting input, and then re-solve the MPC problem using newly obtained measurements at the next time step. However, this approach fails to account for the fact that the control trajectory will be updated in the future, potentially leading to conservative designs. In this paper, we present a novel update-aware robust optimal MPC algorithm for decreasing horizon problems on nonlinear systems that explicitly accounts for future control trajectory updates. This additional insight allows our method to provably expand the feasible solution set and guarantee improved worst-case performance bounds compared to existing techniques. Our approach formulates the trajectory generation problem as a sequence of nested existence-constrained semi-infinite programs (SIPs), which can be efficiently solved using local reduction techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate our approach on a planar quadrotor problem, where it clearly outperforms an equivalent method that does not account for future updates at the cost of increased computation time.</p>

We use SITool to benchmark 13 neural and traditional speech codecs, analyzing phoneme-level degradations and comparing subjective DRT results with objective intelligibility metrics. Our findings show that, while neural speech codecs can outperform traditional ones in subjective intelligibility, only STOI and ESTOI - not WER - significantly correlate with subjective results, although they struggle to capture gender and wordlist-specific variations observed in subjective evaluations.</p>

            <p>In some optimal control problems, complex relationships between states and inputs cannot be easily represented using continuous constraints, necessitating the use of discrete logic instead. This paper presents a method for incorporating such logic constraints directly within continuous optimization frameworks, eliminating the need for binary variables or specialized solvers. Our approach reformulates arbitrary logic constraints under minimal assumptions as max-min constraints, which are then smoothed by introducing auxiliary variables into the optimization problem. When these reformulated constraints are satisfied, they guarantee that the original logical conditions hold, ensuring correctness in the optimization process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on two planar quadrotor control tasks with complex logic constraints. Compared to existing techniques for encoding logic in continuous optimization, our approach achieves faster computational performance and improved convergence to feasible solutions.</p>

The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models.

            <h2>Beyond Pixel Agreement: Large Language Models as Clinical Guardrails for Reliable Medical Image Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxi Sheng, Leyi Yu, Haoyue Li, Yifan Gao, Xin Gao</p>
            <p>Evaluating AI-generated medical image segmentations for clinical acceptability poses a significant challenge, as traditional pixelagreement metrics often fail to capture true diagnostic utility. This paper introduces Hierarchical Clinical Reasoner (HCR), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as clinical guardrails for reliable, zero-shot quality assessment. HCR employs a structured, multistage prompting strategy that guides LLMs through a detailed reasoning process, encompassing knowledge recall, visual feature analysis, anatomical inference, and clinical synthesis, to evaluate segmentations. We evaluated HCR on a diverse dataset across six medical imaging tasks. Our results show that HCR, utilizing models like Gemini 2.5 Flash, achieved a classification accuracy of 78.12%, performing comparably to, and in instances exceeding, dedicated vision models such as ResNet50 (72.92% accuracy) that were specifically trained for this task. The HCR framework not only provides accurate quality classifications but also generates interpretable, step-by-step reasoning for its assessments. This work demonstrates the potential of LLMs, when appropriately guided, to serve as sophisticated evaluators, offering a pathway towards more trustworthy and clinically-aligned quality control for AI in medical imaging.</p>

            <h2>On-device Streaming Discrete Speech Units</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwanghee Choi, Masao Someki, Emma Strubell, Shinji Watanabe</p>
            <p>Discrete speech units (DSUs) are derived from clustering the features of self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). DSUs offer significant advantages for on-device streaming speech applications due to their rich phonetic information, high transmission efficiency, and seamless integration with large language models. However, conventional DSU-based approaches are impractical as they require full-length speech input and computationally expensive S3Ms. In this work, we reduce both the attention window and the model size while preserving the effectiveness of DSUs. Our results demonstrate that we can reduce floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50% with only a relative increase of 6.5% in character error rate (CER) on the ML-SUPERB 1h dataset. These findings highlight the potential of DSUs for real-time speech processing in resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Walter, Jitesh H. Panchal, Philip E. Paré</p>
            <p>We propose a hybrid spreading process model to capture the dynamics of demand for software-based products. We introduce discontinuous jumps in the state to model sudden surges in demand that can be seen immediately after a product update is released. After each update, the modeled demand evolves according to a continuous-time susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. We identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for estimating the hybrid model's parameters for an arbitrary finite number of sequential updates. We verify the parameter estimation conditions in simulation, and evaluate how the estimation of these parameters is impacted by the presence of observation and process noise. We then validate our model by applying our estimation method to daily user engagement data for a regularly updating software product, the live-service video game `Apex Legends.'</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianrui Zheng, Chao Zhang, Philip C. Woodland</p>
            <p>This paper introduces DNCASR, a novel end-to-end trainable system designed for joint neural speaker clustering and automatic speech recognition (ASR), enabling speaker-attributed transcription of long multi-party meetings. DNCASR uses two separate encoders to independently encode global speaker characteristics and local waveform information, along with two linked decoders to generate speaker-attributed transcriptions. The use of linked decoders allows the entire system to be jointly trained under a unified loss function. By employing a serialised training approach, DNCASR effectively addresses overlapping speech in real-world meetings, where the link improves the prediction of speaker indices in overlapping segments. Experiments on the AMI-MDM meeting corpus demonstrate that the jointly trained DNCASR outperforms a parallel system that does not have links between the speaker and ASR decoders. Using cpWER to measure the speaker-attributed word error rate, DNCASR achieves a 9.0% relative reduction on the AMI-MDM Eval set.</p>

            <p>An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based communication typically involves a link between a UAV-mounted antenna and a ground station. The radiation pattern of both antennas is influenced by nearby reflecting surfaces and scatterers, such as the UAV body and the ground. Experimentally characterizing the effective radiation patterns of both antennas is challenging, as the received power depends on their interaction. In this study, we learn a combined radiation pattern from experimental UAV flight data, assuming the UAV travels with a fixed orientation (constant yaw angle and zero pitch/roll). We validate the characterized radiation pattern by cross-referencing it with experiments involving different UAV trajectories, all conducted under identical ground station and UAV orientation conditions. Experimental results show that the learned combined radiation pattern reduces received power estimation error by up to 10 dB, compared to traditional anechoic chamber radiation patterns that neglect the effects of the UAV body and surrounding objects.</p>

            <p>How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's (LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and 3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in generating audio.</p>

            <p>In recent years, deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated promising results in decoding hemodynamic responses captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), particularly in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This work introduces AbsoluteNet, a novel deep learning architecture designed to classify auditory event-related responses recorded using fNIRS. The proposed network is built upon principles of spatio-temporal convolution and customized activation functions. Our model was compared against several models, namely fNIRSNET, MDNN, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet. The results showed that AbsoluteNet outperforms existing models, reaching 87.0% accuracy, 84.8% sensitivity, and 89.2% specificity in binary classification, surpassing fNIRSNET, the second-best model, by 3.8% in accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning model in decoding hemodynamic responses related to auditory processing and highlight the importance of spatio-temporal feature aggregation and customized activation functions to better fit fNIRS dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junmin Gong, Sean Zhao, Sen Wang, Shengyuan Xu, Joe Guo</p>
            <p>We introduce ACE-Step, a novel open-source foundation model for music generation that overcomes key limitations of existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance through a holistic architectural design. Current methods face inherent trade-offs between generation speed, musical coherence, and controllability. For example, LLM-based models (e.g. Yue, SongGen) excel at lyric alignment but suffer from slow inference and structural artifacts. Diffusion models (e.g. DiffRhythm), on the other hand, enable faster synthesis but often lack long-range structural coherence. ACE-Step bridges this gap by integrating diffusion-based generation with Sana's Deep Compression AutoEncoder (DCAE) and a lightweight linear transformer. It also leverages MERT and m-hubert to align semantic representations (REPA) during training, allowing rapid convergence. As a result, our model synthesizes up to 4 minutes of music in just 20 seconds on an A100 GPU-15x faster than LLM-based baselines-while achieving superior musical coherence and lyric alignment across melody, harmony, and rhythm metrics. Moreover, ACE-Step preserves fine-grained acoustic details, enabling advanced control mechanisms such as voice cloning, lyric editing, remixing, and track generation (e.g. lyric2vocal, singing2accompaniment). Rather than building yet another end-to-end text-to-music pipeline, our vision is to establish a foundation model for music AI: a fast, general-purpose, efficient yet flexible architecture that makes it easy to train subtasks on top of it. This paves the way for the development of powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. In short, our goal is to build a stable diffusion moment for music. The code, the model weights and the demo are available at: this https URL.</p>

            <p>Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures, similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit, particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779 labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language. We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best among the SOTA models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linh Pham</p>
            <p>There are few code switching datasets, labeled or unlabled, that exist today. As a result, ASR requires new methods to utilize the vast monolingual data and models that exist. This paper uses OpenAI's open source ASR model, Whisper, which has been pre-trained on 680K hours of audio to perform monolingual ASR tasks. In Part 1, this paper examines how exploiting Whisper's monolingual ability to individually tokenize training text, called "Switching Tokenizers Method", improves transcription accuracy. In Part 2, we combine the Switching Tokenizers Method from part 1 and train a GELU based adapter on the encoder. These two methods reduced Total Mixed Error Rate (MER) to 9.4% for the ASCEND dataset, 6% for SEAME devman and 9.7% for SEAME devsge, outperforming current SoTA methods.</p>

            <p>The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license. However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across 75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the ESPnet toolkit.</p>

The dataset is available as a single, freely accessible archive, promoting accessibility and research in this important domain. We envision models trained on this data powering next-generation public engagement applications, and assisting biologists, ecologists, and land use managers in processing large audio collections, thereby contributing to the understanding of species compositions in diverse soundscapes.</p>

Our model comprises: (i) a speech content encoder for phoneme embedding restoration via pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) speech foundation models; (ii) a speaker identity encoder for speaker-aware identity preservation by in-context learning mechanism; (iii) a diffusion-based speech generator to reconstruct the speech based on the restored phoneme embedding and preserved speaker identity.

            <p>While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{this https URL}{here}$.</p>

            <p>In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment scenarios.</p>

            <p>Existing methods for deepfake audio detection have demonstrated some effectiveness. However, they still face challenges in generalizing to new forgery techniques and evolving attack patterns. This limitation mainly arises because the models rely heavily on the distribution of the training data and fail to learn a decision boundary that captures the essential characteristics of forgeries. Additionally, relying solely on a classification loss makes it difficult to capture the intrinsic differences between real and fake audio. In this paper, we propose the RPRA-ADD, an integrated Reconstruction-Perception-Reinforcement-Attention networks based forgery trace enhancement-driven robust audio deepfake detection framework. First, we propose a Global-Local Forgery Perception (GLFP) module for enhancing the acoustic perception capacity of forgery traces. To significantly reinforce the feature space distribution differences between real and fake audio, the Multi-stage Dispersed Enhancement Loss (MDEL) is designed, which implements a dispersal strategy in multi-stage feature spaces. Furthermore, in order to enhance feature awareness towards forgery traces, the Fake Trace Focused Attention (FTFA) mechanism is introduced to adjust attention weights dynamically according to the reconstruction discrepancy matrix. Visualization experiments not only demonstrate that FTFA improves attention to voice segments, but also enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmark datasets, including ASVspoof2019, ASVspoof2021, CodecFake, and FakeSound, achieving over 20% performance improvement. In addition, it outperforms existing methods in rigorous 3*3 cross-domain evaluations across Speech, Sound, and Singing, demonstrating strong generalization capability across diverse audio domains.</p>

This flexible method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art method in low-data settings.

            <p>Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw audio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for contemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are optimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the downstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to overcome this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{MagiCodec}$, a novel single-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed with a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection and latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic expressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction fidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency domain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and fostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that MagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like distributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving compatibility with language-model-based generative architectures.

            <p>Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological (e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation), and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across different ASR systems.</p>

            <p>High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware, signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for high-resolution generative modeling.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diogo Landau, Ingeborg de Pater, Mihaela Mitici, Nishant Saurabh</p>
            <p>Complex systems such as aircraft engines are continuously monitored by sensors. In predictive aircraft maintenance, the collected sensor measurements are used to estimate the health condition and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of such systems. However, a major challenge when developing prognostics is the limited number of run-to-failure data samples. This challenge could be overcome if multiple airlines would share their run-to-failure data samples such that sufficient learning can be achieved. Due to privacy concerns, however, airlines are reluctant to share their data in a centralized setting. In this paper, a collaborative federated learning framework is therefore developed instead. Here, several airlines cooperate to train a collective RUL prognostic machine learning model, without the need to centrally share their data. For this, a decentralized validation procedure is proposed to validate the prognostics model without sharing any data. Moreover, sensor data is often noisy and of low quality. This paper therefore proposes four novel methods to aggregate the parameters of the global prognostic model. These methods enhance the robustness of the FL framework against noisy data. The proposed framework is illustrated for training a collaborative RUL prognostic model for aircraft engines, using the N-CMAPSS dataset. Here, six airlines are considered, that collaborate in the FL framework to train a collective RUL prognostic model for their aircraft's engines. When comparing the proposed FL framework with the case where each airline independently develops their own prognostic model, the results show that FL leads to more accurate RUL prognostics for five out of the six airlines. Moreover, the novel robust aggregation methods render the FL framework robust to noisy data samples.</p>

            <p>Noninvasive imaging deep into the adult brain at submillimeter and millisecond scales remains a challenge in medical imaging. Here, we report a helmet based ultrasound brain imager built from a customized helmet, a scanned ultrasound array, and three dimensional printing for real time imaging of human brain anatomical and functional information. Through its application to post hemicraniectomy patients in a sitting position, we achieved volumetric brain tissue structural, vascular, and blood flow images at centimeter scale depths with submillimeter and millisecond spatiotemporal resolutions. We also demonstrated the system capability to track cerebral blood flow over repeated imaging sessions, including during motion prone conditions. Our brain imager circumvents the skull and bridges the gap between high resolution human brain imaging and wearable convenience. This imager may serve as a platform for further investigations into human brain dynamics in post hemicraniectomy patients and offer insights into the brain that could surpass those obtained from non human primate studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakir Hussain Shaik, Sai Subramanyam Thoota, Emil Björnson, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>We propose a novel resource-efficient over-the-air(OTA) computation framework to address the huge fronthaul computational and control overhead requirements in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. We show that the global sufficient statistics to decode the data symbols can be computed OTA using the locally available information at the access points (APs). We provide the essential signal processing aspects at the APs and the central processing unit (CPU) to facilitate the OTA computation of sufficient statistics. The proposed framework scales effectively with an increase in the number of APs. We also make a comprehensive study of the benefits of an OTA framework compared to a conventional digital fronthaul in terms of the overhead associated in transferring the sufficient statistics from the APs to the CPU. To evaluate the performance of the OTA framework, we give closed-form expressions for the mean-square error (MSE)of the estimators of sufficient statistics and the overall data estimator. Furthermore, we assess the symbol error rate (SER)and bit error rate (BER) of the user equipment (UEs) data to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and benchmark them against the state-of-the-art wired fronthaul networks.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Upsample and Upmix Audio in the Latent Domain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Bralios, Paris Smaragdis, Jonah Casebeer</p>
            <p>Neural audio autoencoders create compact latent representations that preserve perceptually important information, serving as the foundation for both modern audio compression systems and generation approaches like next-token prediction and latent diffusion. Despite their prevalence, most audio processing operations, such as spatial and spectral up-sampling, still inefficiently operate on raw waveforms or spectral representations rather than directly on these compressed representations. We propose a framework that performs audio processing operations entirely within an autoencoder's latent space, eliminating the need to decode to raw audio formats. Our approach dramatically simplifies training by operating solely in the latent domain, with a latent L1 reconstruction term, augmented by a single latent adversarial discriminator. This contrasts sharply with raw-audio methods that typically require complex combinations of multi-scale losses and discriminators. Through experiments in bandwidth extension and mono-to-stereo up-mixing, we demonstrate computational efficiency gains of up to 100x while maintaining quality comparable to post-processing on raw audio. This work establishes a more efficient paradigm for audio processing pipelines that already incorporate autoencoders, enabling significantly faster and more resource-efficient workflows across various audio tasks.</p>

            <p>We present an adaptive control scheme to enable the emergence of order within distributed, autonomous multi-agent systems. Past studies showed that under high-density conditions, order generated from traffic-following behavior reduces travel times, while under low densities, choosing direct paths is more beneficial. In this paper, we leveraged those findings to allow aircraft to independently and dynamically adjust their degree of traffic-following behavior based on the current state of the airspace. This enables aircraft to follow other traffic only when beneficial. Quantitative analyses revealed that dynamic traffic-following behavior results in lower aircraft travel times at the cost of minimal levels of additional disorder to the airspace. The sensitivity of these benefits to temporal and spatial horizons was also investigated. Overall, this work highlights the benefits, and potential necessity, of incorporating self-organizing behavior in making distributed, autonomous multi-agent systems scalable.</p>

            <p>Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information, making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model (LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.</p>

            <p>In video dubbing, aligning translated audio with the source audio is a significant challenge. Our focus is on achieving this efficiently, tailored for real-time, on-device video dubbing scenarios. We developed a phoneme-based end-to-end length-sensitive speech translation (LSST) model, which generates translations of varying lengths short, normal, and long using predefined tags. Additionally, we introduced length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding pass. This approach maintained comparable BLEU scores compared to a baseline without length awareness while significantly enhancing synchronization quality between source and target audio, achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) gain of 0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Action Dependency Graphs for Globally Optimal Coordinated Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianglin Ding, Jingcheng Tang, Gangshan Jing</p>
            <p>Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies, which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the `action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies. Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality. Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios, underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Feng Lo, Changmin Lee, Chan-Byoung Chae</p>
            <p>Molecular communication (MC), one of the emerging techniques in the field of communication, is entering a new phase following several decades of foundational research. Recently, attention has shifted toward MC in liquid media, particularly within tubular environments, due to novel application scenarios. The spatial constraints of such environments make accurate modeling of molecular movement in tubes more challenging than in traditional free-space channels. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional channel model for molecular communications with an absorbing ring-shaped receiver in a tubular environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to model the impact of an absorbing ring-shaped receiver on the channel response in tube-based MC systems. The problem is formulated as a partial differential equation with heterogeneous boundary conditions, and an approximate solution is derived under flow-dominated conditions. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through particle-based simulations. We anticipate that the results of this study will contribute to the design of practical MC systems in real-world tubular environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nabarun Goswami, Tatsuya Harada</p>
            <p>We propose a multi-stage framework for universal speech enhancement, designed for the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge. Our system first employs a Sparse Compression Network to robustly separate sources and extract an initial clean speech estimate from noisy inputs. This is followed by an efficient generative model that refines speech quality by leveraging self-supervised features and optimizing a masked language modeling objective on acoustic tokens derived from a neural audio codec. In the final stage, a fusion network integrates the outputs of the first two stages with the original noisy signal, achieving a balanced improvement in both signal fidelity and perceptual quality. Additionally, a shift trick that aggregates multiple time-shifted predictions, along with output blending, further boosts performance. Experimental results on challenging multilingual datasets with variable sampling rates and diverse distortion types validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation. Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining, bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.</p>

            <p>We introduce machine unlearning for speech tasks, a novel and underexplored research problem that aims to efficiently and effectively remove the influence of specific data from trained speech models without full retraining. This has important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points (e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.</p>

            <h2>Fine-Tuning ASR for Stuttered Speech: Personalized vs. Generalized Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dena Mujtaba, Nihar Mahapatra</p>
            <p>Stuttering -- characterized by involuntary disfluencies such as blocks, prolongations, and repetitions -- is often misinterpreted by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, resulting in elevated word error rates and making voice-driven technologies inaccessible to people who stutter. The variability of disfluencies across speakers and contexts further complicates ASR training, compounded by limited annotated stuttered speech data. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning ASRs for stuttered speech, comparing generalized models (trained across multiple speakers) to personalized models tailored to individual speech characteristics. Using a diverse range of voice-AI scenarios, including virtual assistants and video interviews, we evaluate how personalization affects transcription accuracy. Our findings show that personalized ASRs significantly reduce word error rates, especially in spontaneous speech, highlighting the potential of tailored models for more inclusive voice technologies.</p>

            <p>Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.</p>

            <p>To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

            <p>While audio foundation models perform well on myriad of tasks from sound classification to speech analysis, these models are trained and tested on dry, non-spatial, single-source audio clips. This limits their success in real-world situations and results in spatially unaware audio embeddings. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised training approach for General-Purpose, Real-world Audio Models (GRAMs). The GRAM training approach enables robust spatial audio representation learning for naturalistic, noisy sound scenes and can be applied to any masking-based deep learning model. We demonstrate the success of our approach by training two state-of-the-art models, one with a transformer and one with a mamba backbone. We assess the quality of the extracted audio representations from GRAMs using the original version of the HEAR benchmark, a newly synthesized, naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark, and novel sound localization tasks based on HEAR benchmark datasets. The results show that our approach minimizes the performance gap between dry, non-spatial, single-source sound scenes and naturalistic sound scenes for crucial tasks such as auditory scene analysis, outperforming existing state-of-the-art audio foundation models at a fraction of the training steps. Moreover, GRAMs show state-of-the-art performance on sound localization tasks, exceeding even supervised sound localization models. In sum, the proposed approach represents a significant advancement towards robust audio foundation models for real-world applications with state-of-the-art performance on naturalistic sound scenes as well as spatial audio representation learning.</p>

            <p>The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area.

In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</p>

Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have increased demand for personalized audio synthesis. Zero-shot voice cloning, a specialized TTS task, aims to synthesize a target speaker's voice using only a single audio sample and arbitrary text, without prior exposure to the speaker during training. This process employs pattern recognition techniques to analyze and replicate the speaker's unique vocal features. Despite progress, challenges remain in adapting to the vocal style of unseen speakers, highlighting difficulties in generalizing TTS systems to handle diverse voices while maintaining naturalness, expressiveness, and speaker fidelity. To address the challenges of unseen speaker style adaptation, we propose DS-TTS, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the synthesis of diverse, previously unheard voices. Central to our method is a Dual-Style Encoding Network (DuSEN), where two distinct style encoders capture complementary aspects of a speaker's vocal identity. These speaker-specific style vectors are seamlessly integrated into the Dynamic Generator Network (DyGN) via a Style Gating-Film (SGF) mechanism, enabling more accurate and expressive reproduction of unseen speakers' unique vocal characteristics. In addition, we introduce a Dynamic Generator Network to tackle synthesis issues that arise with varying sentence lengths. By dynamically adapting to the length of the input, this component ensures robust performance across diverse text inputs and speaker styles, significantly improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen speakers in a more natural and expressive manner. Experimental evaluations on the VCTK dataset suggest that DS-TTS demonstrates superior overall performance in voice cloning tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art models, showing notable improvements in both word error rate and speaker similarity.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a model that integrates sub-band processing and deep filtering to fully exploit information from the target time-frequency (TF) bin and its surrounding TF bins for single-channel speech enhancement. The sub-band module captures surrounding frequency bin information at the input, while the deep filtering module applies filtering at the output to both the target TF bin and its surrounding TF bins. To further improve the model performance, we decouple deep filtering into temporal and frequency components and introduce a two-stage framework, reducing the complexity of filter coefficient prediction at each stage. Additionally, we propose the TAConv module to strengthen convolutional feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical deep filtering network (HDF-Net) effectively utilizes surrounding TF bin information and outperforms other advanced systems while using fewer resources.</p>

            <p>Robotic surgery imposes a significant cognitive burden on the surgeon. This cognitive burden increases in the case of remote robotic surgeries due to latency between entities and thus might affect the quality of surgery. Here, the patient side and the surgeon side are geographically separated by hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Real-time teleoperation of robots requires strict latency bounds for control and feedback. We propose a dual digital twin (DT) framework and explain the simulation environment and teleoperation framework. Here, the doctor visually controls the locally available DT of the patient side and thus experiences minimum latency. The second digital twin serves two purposes. Firstly, it provides a layer of safety for operator-related mishaps, and secondly, it conveys the coordinates of known and unknown objects back to the operator's side digital twin. We show that teleoperation accuracy and user experience are enhanced with our approach. Experimental results using the NASA-TLX metric show that the quality of surgery is vastly improved with DT, perhaps due to reduced cognitive burden. The network data rate for identifying objects at the operator side is 25x lower than normal.</p>

However, the advantages of these models come at the cost of requiring a large number of sampling steps. This limitation hinders their practical application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce ReFlow-VC, a novel high-fidelity speech conversion method based on rectified flow. Specifically, ReFlow-VC is an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model that transforms a Gaussian distribution to the true Mel-spectrogram distribution along the most direct path. Furthermore, we propose a modeling approach that optimizes speaker features by utilizing both content and pitch information, allowing speaker features to reflect the properties of the current speech more accurately. Experimental results show that ReFlow-VC performs exceptionally well in small datasets and zero-shot scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Zhao</p>
            <p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling.

            <h2>FusionAudio-1.2M: Towards Fine-grained Audio Captioning with Multimodal Contextual Fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunian Chen, Xinyuan Xie, Zheshu Chen, Liyan Zhao, Owen Lee, Zhan Su, Qilin Sun, Benyou Wang</p>
            <p>High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following. This paper paves the way for more nuanced and accurate automated understanding of complex audio environments. Code and data can be found in this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Evaluation of Acoustic Feature Extraction Tools for Clinical Speech Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Seo Gyeong Choi, Alexander Richardson, Ryan Partlan, Sunny Tang, Sunghye Cho</p>
            <p>This study compares three acoustic feature extraction toolkits (OpenSMILE, Praat, and Librosa) applied to clinical speech data from individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and healthy controls (HC). By standardizing extraction parameters across the toolkits, we analyzed speech samples from 77 SSD and 87 HC participants and found significant toolkit-dependent variations. While F0 percentiles showed high cross-toolkit correlation (r=0.962 to 0.999), measures like F0 standard deviation and formant values often had poor, even negative, agreement. Additionally, correlation patterns differed between SSD and HC groups. Classification analysis identified F0 mean, HNR, and MFCC1 (AUC greater than 0.70) as promising discriminators. These findings underscore reproducibility concerns and advocate for standardized protocols, multi-toolkit cross-validation, and transparent reporting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asım Ersoy, Basel Mousi, Shammur Chowdhury, Firoj Alam, Fahim Dalvi, Nadir Durrani</p>
            <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities: Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities. For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the community.</p>

            <p>Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS, trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech. We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization, followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity, requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).</p>

            <p>We consider iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms applied to functions that are smooth and strongly convex. The fastest globally convergent algorithm for this class of functions is the Triple Momentum (TM) method. We show that if the objective function is also twice continuously differentiable, a new, faster algorithm emerges, which we call $C^2$-Momentum (C2M). We prove that C2M is globally convergent and that its worst-case convergence rate is strictly faster than that of TM, with no additional computational cost. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical examples, demonstrating that C2M outperforms TM when the objective function is twice continuously differentiable.</p>

            <h2>Iola Walker: A Mobile Footfall Detection System for Music Composition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Will James</p>
            <p>This project is the first of several experiments composing music that changes in response to biosignals. The system is dubbed "iola walker" in reference to a common polyrhythm, the hemiola. A listener goes for a walk, and the Iola Walker app detects their walking pace. Iola Walker picks up footfalls using a foot-mounted accelerometer, processing the signals in real time using a recurrent neural network in an Android app. The Android app outputs a MIDI event for each footfall. The iola walker player, which might be a VST running in a DAW, plays the version of the next music passage with underlying polyrhythms closest to the listener's walking pace. This paper documents the process of training the model to detect the footfalls in real time. The model is trained on accelerometer data from an Mbient Labs foot-mounted IMU at 200~Hz, with the ground truth for footfalls annotated by pressing the volume-up button on the Android device when the foot hits the ground. To collect training data, I walked around my neighborhood clicking the volume-up button each time my foot hit the ground. Several methods were tried for detecting footfalls in real time from sensor data, including ones based on digital signal processing techniques and traditional machine learning techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Zhang, Henry Kenlay, Li Zhang, Mihai Cucuringu, Xiaowen Dong</p>
            <p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Nakagome, Michael Hentschel</p>
            <p>Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems. Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches, allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for unknown words.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian Diao, Tianzhen Yang, Chunhui Zhang, Weiyi Wu, Ming Cheng, Jiang Gui</p>
            <p>Music performances, characterized by dense and continuous audio as well as seamless audio-visual integration, present unique challenges for multimodal scene understanding and reasoning. Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0 training data and retains 70-80% of full-data performance across models.</p>

            <h2>Two-Stage Learning of Stabilizing Neural Controllers via Zubov Sampling and Iterative Domain Expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Li, Xiangru Zhong, Bin Hu, Huan Zhang</p>
            <p>Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimations of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms. Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much conservatism remains in their framework. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize the controller and Lyapunov function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we propose a novel training data sampling strategy and a domain updating mechanism that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10000$ times faster compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal.

            <h2>Quantitative Error Feedback for Quantization Noise Reduction of Filtering over Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue Xian Zheng, Weihang Liu, Xin Lou, Stefan Vlaski, Tareq Al-Naffouri</p>
            <p>This paper introduces an innovative error feedback framework designed to mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, where communications are constrained to quantized messages. It comes from error spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different domains. In contrast to existing error compensation methods, our framework quantitatively feeds back the quantization noise for exact compensation. We examine the framework under three key scenarios: (i) deterministic graph filtering, (ii) graph filtering over random graphs, and (iii) graph filtering with random node-asynchronous updates. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces the effect of quantization noise, and we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal error feedback coefficients. Moreover, this quantitative error feedback mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into communication-efficient decentralized optimization frameworks, enabling lower error floors. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, consistently showing that our method outperforms conventional quantization strategies in terms of both accuracy and robustness.</p>

            <p>This paper reports on the development of a large-scale speech recognition model, Whale. Similar to models such as Whisper and OWSM, Whale leverages both a large model size and a diverse, extensive dataset. Whale's architecture integrates w2v-BERT self-supervised model, an encoder-decoder backbone built on E-Branchformer, and a joint CTC-attention decoding strategy. The training corpus comprises varied speech data, of not only public corpora but also in-house data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to different speaking styles and acoustic conditions. Through evaluations on multiple benchmarks, Whale achieved comparable performance to existing models. In particular, it achieves a word error rate of 2.4% on the Librispeech test-clean set and a character error rate of 3.4% on the CSJ eval3 set, outperforming Whisper large-v3 and OWSM v3.1.</p>

            <p>To compare the performance of two speech generation sys- tems, one of the most effective approaches is estimating the preference score between their generated speech. This pa- per proposes a novel universal preference-score-based pairwise speech quality assessment (UPPSQA) model, aimed at predict- ing the preference score between paired speech samples to de- termine which one has better quality. The model first predicts the absolute mean opinion score (MOS) for the two speech sam- ples separately, and then aggregates them into a relative prefer- ence score using a preference function. To address the scarcity of preference data, we also construct a new pairwise speech dataset based on a MOS dataset for experiments. Experimental results confirm that, whether in training scenarios with differ- ent data types and label conditions, or in both in-domain and out-of-domain test scenarios, the prediction accuracy of UPP- SQA outperforms that of the baseline models, demonstrating its universality.</p>

            <p>Deep generative models have recently been employed for speech enhancement to generate perceptually valid clean speech on large-scale datasets. Several diffusion models have been proposed, and more recently, a tractable Schrödinger Bridge has been introduced to transport between the clean and noisy speech distributions. However, these models often suffer from an iterative reverse process and require a large number of sampling steps -- more than 50. Our investigation reveals that the performance of baseline models significantly degrades when the number of sampling steps is reduced, particularly under low-SNR conditions. We propose integrating Schrödinger Bridge with GANs to effectively mitigate this issue, achieving high-quality outputs on full-band datasets while substantially reducing the required sampling steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing baselines, even with a single inference step, in both denoising and dereverberation tasks.</p>

The specific properties of various models are also discussed. Directions for future investigations are provided. In this paper, the authors revisited some publications based on the assumption that the external excitations are produced by non-ideal sources (RNIS), that is, with limited power supply. Among these applications, nonlinear phenomena such as the Sommerfeld effect and saturation phenomenon were observed, considering fractional damping. Energy harvesters and the Jacobi-Anger expansion were used in the governing equations of motion. We also used the Jacobi-Anger expansion in the case of energy transfer between vibrating modes under an external force with time-varying frequency, which represents one of the future directions of research on non-ideal vibrating systems (RNIS).</p>

            <p>Stage lighting plays an essential role in live music performances, influencing the engaging experience of both musicians and audiences. Given the high costs associated with hiring or training professional lighting engineers, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has gained increasing attention. However, most existing approaches only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this issue, this paper presents an end-to-end solution that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers -- Skip-BART. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method modifies the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame this http URL validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting this http URL, our method yields a p-value of 0.72 in a statistical comparison based on human evaluations with human lighting engineers, suggesting that the proposed approach closely matches human lighting engineering performance.

            <p>Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs.

            <p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a class of bio -inspired networks that leverage sparse, event- driven signaling to achieve low-power computation while inherently modeling temporal dynamics. Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource- constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time - series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismaila Salihou Adamou, Elsa Dupraz, Reza Asvadi, Tad Matsumoto</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the design of practical shortlength coding schemes for Distributed Hypothesis Testing (DHT). While most prior work on DHT has focused on informationtheoretic analyses, deriving bounds on Type-II error exponents via achievability schemes based on quantization and quantizebinning, the practical implementation of DHT coding schemes has remained largely unexplored. Moreover, existing practical coding solutions for quantization and quantize-binning approaches were developed for source reconstruction tasks considering very long code length, and they are not directly applicable to DHT. In this context, this paper introduces efficient shortlength implementations of quantization and quantize-binning schemes for DHT, constructed from short binary linear block codes. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed coding schemes compared to uncoded cases and to existing schemes initially developed for data reconstruction. In addition to practical code design, the paper derives exact analytical expressions for the Type-I and Type-II error probabilities associated with each proposed scheme. The provided analytical expressions are shown to predict accurately the practical performance measured from Monte-Carlo simulations of the proposed schemes. These theoretical results are novel and offer a useful framework for optimizing and comparing practical DHT schemes across a wide range of source and code parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwei Yu, Junhong Xu, Lantao Liu</p>
            <p>Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured environments. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable environments to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of outdoor environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce ADEPT, a novel \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{T}ransfer in the zero-shot sim-to-real fashion that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex environments adaptive to the current policy. ADEPT guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted environments from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADEPT seamlessly transitions between generating similar environments for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. To benchmark ADEPT in off-road navigation, we propose a fast and effective multi-layer map representation for wild environment generation. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADEPT outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.</p>

            <h2>Systematic Hazard Analysis for Frontier AI using STPA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Mylius</p>
            <p>All of the frontier AI companies have published safety frameworks where they define capability thresholds and risk mitigations that determine how they will safely develop and deploy their models. Adoption of systematic approaches to risk modelling, based on established practices used in safety-critical industries, has been recommended, however frontier AI companies currently do not describe in detail any structured approach to identifying and analysing hazards. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology for identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards. It achieves this by mapping out controllers and controlled processes then analysing their interactions and feedback loops to understand how harmful outcomes could occur (Leveson & Thomas, 2018). We evaluate STPA's ability to broaden the scope, improve traceability and strengthen the robustness of safety assurance for frontier AI systems. Applying STPA to the threat model and scenario described in 'A Sketch of an AI Control Safety Case' (Korbak et al., 2025), we derive a list of Unsafe Control Actions. From these we select a subset and explore the Loss Scenarios that lead to them if left unmitigated. We find that STPA is able to identify causal factors that may be missed by unstructured hazard analysis methodologies thereby improving robustness. We suggest STPA could increase the safety assurance of frontier AI when used to complement or check coverage of existing AI governance techniques including capability thresholds, model evaluations and emergency procedures. The application of a systematic methodology supports scalability by increasing the proportion of the analysis that could be conducted by LLMs, reducing the burden on human domain experts.</p>

            <p>High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties. While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic, rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Learning of Balanced Signed Graphs via Sparse Linear Programming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Yokota, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka, Gene Cheung</p>
            <p>Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights, encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters, wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.</p>

            <h2>EEG Foundation Models for BCI Learn Diverse Features of Electrophysiology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mattson Ogg, Rahul Hingorani, Diego Luna, Griffin W. Milsap, William G. Coon, Clara A. Scholl</p>
            <p>Brain computer interface (BCI) research, as well as increasing portions of the field of neuroscience, have found success deploying large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) pre-training methods in conjunction with vast public repositories of data. This approach of pre-training foundation models using label-free, self-supervised objectives offers the potential to learn robust representations of neurophysiology, potentially addressing longstanding challenges in neural decoding. However, to date, much of this work has focused explicitly on standard BCI benchmarks and tasks, which likely overlooks the multitude of features these powerful methods might learn about brain function as well as other electrophysiological information. We introduce a new method for self-supervised BCI foundation model pre-training for EEG inspired by a transformer-based approach adapted from the HuBERT framework originally developed for speech processing. Our pipeline is specifically focused on low-profile, real-time usage, involving minimally pre-processed data and just eight EEG channels on the scalp. We show that our foundation model learned a representation of EEG that supports standard BCI tasks (P300, motor imagery), but also that this model learns features of neural data related to individual variability, and other salient electrophysiological components (e.g., alpha rhythms). In addition to describing and evaluating a novel approach to pre-training BCI models and neural decoding, this work opens the aperture for what kind of tasks and use-cases might exist for neural data in concert with powerful AI methods.</p>

            <p>Analyzing the planet at scale with satellite imagery and machine learning is a dream that has been constantly hindered by the cost of difficult-to-access highly-representative high-resolution imagery. To remediate this, we introduce here the WorldStrat dataset. The largest and most varied such publicly available dataset, at Airbus SPOT 6/7 satellites' high resolution of up to 1.5 m/pixel, empowered by European Space Agency's Phi-Lab as part of the ESA-funded QueryPlanet project, we curate nearly 10,000 sqkm of unique locations to ensure stratified representation of all types of land-use across the world: from agriculture to ice caps, from forests to multiple urbanization densities. We also enrich those with locations typically under-represented in ML datasets: sites of humanitarian interest, illegal mining sites, and settlements of persons at risk. We temporally-match each high-resolution image with multiple low-resolution images from the freely accessible lower-resolution Sentinel-2 satellites at 10 m/pixel. We accompany this dataset with an open-source Python package to: rebuild or extend the WorldStrat dataset, train and infer baseline algorithms, and learn with abundant tutorials, all compatible with the popular EO-learn toolbox. We hereby hope to foster broad-spectrum applications of ML to satellite imagery, and possibly develop from free public low-resolution Sentinel2 imagery the same power of analysis allowed by costly private high-resolution imagery. We illustrate this specific point by training and releasing several highly compute-efficient baselines on the task of Multi-Frame Super-Resolution. High-resolution Airbus imagery is CC BY-NC, while the labels and Sentinel2 imagery are CC BY, and the source code and pre-trained models under BSD.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochun Ge, Shanping Yu, Wenqian Shen, Chengwen Xing, Byonghyo Shim</p>
            <p>Beamforming design with partial channel estimation and feedback for frequency-division duplexing (FDD) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted systems is considered in this paper. We leverage the observation that path angle information (PAI) varies more slowly than path gain information (PGI). Then, several dominant paths are selected among all the cascaded paths according to the known PAI for maximizing the spectral efficiency of downlink data transmission. To acquire the dominating path gain information (DPGI, also regarded as the path gains of selected dominant paths) at the base station (BS), we propose a DPGI estimation and feedback scheme by jointly beamforming design at BS and RIS. Both the required number of downlink pilot signals and the length of uplink feedback vector are reduced to the number of dominant paths, and thus we achieve a great reduction of the pilot overhead and feedback overhead. Furthermore, we optimize the active BS beamformer and passive RIS beamformer by exploiting the feedback DPGI to further improve the spectral efficiency. From numerical results, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the conventional schemes.</p>

            <p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scan yields all possible cross-section images of a retina for detecting biomarkers linked to optical defects. Due to the high volume of data generated, an automated and reliable biomarker detection pipeline is necessary as a primary screening stage. We outline our new state-of-the-art pipeline for identifying biomarkers from OCT scans. In collaboration with trained ophthalmologists, we identify local and global structures in biomarkers. Through a comprehensive and systematic review of existing vision architectures, we evaluate different convolution and attention mechanisms for biomarker detection. We find that MaxViT, a hybrid vision transformer combining convolution layers with strided attention, is better suited for local feature detection, while EVA-02, a standard vision transformer leveraging pure attention and large-scale knowledge distillation, excels at capturing global features. We ensemble the predictions of both models to achieve first place in the IEEE Video and Image Processing Cup 2023 competition on OCT biomarker detection, achieving a patient-wise F1 score of 0.8527 in the final phase of the competition, scoring 3.8\% higher than the next best solution. Finally, we used knowledge distillation to train a single MaxViT to outperform our ensemble at a fraction of the computation cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gennaro Notomista, Mario Selvaggio, Francesca Pagano, María Santos, Siddharth Mayya, Vincenzo Lippiello, Cristian Secchi</p>
            <p>The ability of executing multiple tasks simultaneously is an important feature of redundant robotic systems. As a matter of fact, complex behaviors can often be obtained as a result of the execution of several tasks. Moreover, in safety-critical applications, tasks designed to ensure the safety of the robot and its surroundings have to be executed along with other nominal tasks. In such cases, it is also important to prioritize the former over the latter. In this paper, we formalize the definition of extended set-based tasks, i.e., tasks which can be executed by rendering subsets of the task space asymptotically stable or forward invariant using control barrier functions. We propose a formal mathematical representation of such tasks that allows for the execution of more complex and time-varying prioritized stacks of tasks using kinematic and dynamic robot models alike. We present an optimization-based framework which is computationally efficient, accounts for input bounds, and allows for the stable execution of time-varying prioritized stacks of extended set-based tasks. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulations, quantitative comparisons to the state-of-the-art hierarchical quadratic programming, and experiments with robotic manipulators.</p>

            <h2>Self-supervised Reflective Learning through Self-distillation and Online Clustering for Speaker Representation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danwei Cai, Zexin Cai, Ze Li, Ming Li</p>
            <p>Speaker representation learning is crucial for voice recognition systems, with recent advances in self-supervised approaches reducing dependency on labeled data. Current two-stage iterative frameworks, while effective, suffer from significant computational overhead due to repeated rounds of clustering and training. They also struggle with noisy pseudo labels that can impair model learning. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning (SSRL), an improved framework that addresses these limitations by enabling continuous refinement of pseudo labels during training. Through a teacher-student architecture and online clustering mechanism, SSRL eliminates the need for iterative training rounds. To handle label noise, we incorporate noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues that maintain temporal consistency. Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current two-stage iterative approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent improvements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts demonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks an important advancement in efficient and accurate self-supervised speaker representation learning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.</p>

In contrast to the existing work, which assumes the boundedness of noise, we show that an $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ high-probability regret can be achieved under unbounded noise, where $ T $ denotes the time horizon. Notably, the noise is only required to have a finite fourth moment. Moreover, when the costs are strongly convex and the noise is sub-Gaussian, we establish an $ O({\rm poly} (\log T)) $ regret bound.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Li, Zhiyong Sun, Patrick J. W. Koelewijn, Siep Weiland</p>
            <p>Sontag's universal formula is a widely used technique for stabilizing control through control Lyapunov functions. Recently, it has been extended to address safety-critical control by incorporating control barrier functions (CBFs). However, deriving a universal formula that satisfies requirements on essential properties, including safety, smoothness, and robustness against input disturbances, is still an open problem. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel solution - a tunable universal formula - by incorporating a (state-dependent) tunable term into Sontag's formula. This tunable term enables the regulation of safety-critical control performances, allowing the attainment of desired properties through a proper selection of tunable terms. Generally, the tunable universal formula can be seen as a controller that improves the quadratic program (QP)-synthesized controllers in terms of robustness and smoothness, while also reducing the conservatism (corresponding to robustness) in Sontag's formula. Furthermore, we extend the tunable universal formula to address safety-critical control problems with norm-bounded input constraints, showcasing its applicability across diverse control scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a two-link manipulator safe tracking example, investigating the essential properties including safety, smoothness, and robustness against input disturbances under various tunable terms.</p>

            <p>Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anis Hamadouche, Mathini Sellathurai</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel framework for tracking and predicting Channel State Information (CSI) by leveraging Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAE) integrated with a learned Koopman operator. The proposed approach models CSI as a nonlinear dynamical system governed by both intrinsic channel behavior and exogenous contextual factors such as position, temperature, and atmospheric conditions. The architecture comprises dual autoencoders-one dedicated to CSI and another to contextual inputs-linked via a shared latent state space, within which the Koopman operator captures the linear temporal evolution of CSI dynamics. This coupling enables accurate, data-driven forecasting of CSI trajectories while maintaining interpretability through a structured, physics-consistent representation. The framework supports real-time updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), enhancing the adaptability and reliability of communication systems in complex and time-varying environments. By unifying Koopman theory with learned latent representations, the proposed method provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for next-generation wireless networks. Empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering high-fidelity CSI predictions under diverse channel conditions.</p>

            <p>Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.</p>

Emotional voice conversion (EVC) modifies emotional expressions while preserving linguistic content and speaker identity, improving applications like human-machine interaction. While deep learning has advanced EVC models for specific target speakers on well-crafted emotional datasets, existing methods often face issues with emotion accuracy and speech distortion. In addition, the zero-shot scenario, in which emotion conversion is applied to unseen speakers, remains underexplored. This work introduces a novel diffusion framework with disentangled mechanisms and expressive guidance, trained on a large emotional speech dataset and evaluated on unseen speakers across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Experimental results show that our method produces expressive speech with high emotional accuracy, naturalness, and quality, showcasing its potential for broader EVC applications.</p>

This paper raises the necessity of implementing privacy-preservation measures on the design of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output ISAC systems. To that purpose, given an adversary model, we propose an iterative framework of two blocks, precoder design and access point selection. The precoder design aims at maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the sensing receivers given communication constraints. The access point selection aims at minimizing the mutual information between the received signal at users and the sensing signal, by rearranging the access points that transmit ISAC-signals and the sensing receivers. Results show that a reduction in the probability of detection by the adversary is obtained with this method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Chatzikiriakos, Robin Strässer, Frank Allgöwer, Andrea Iannelli</p>
            <p>In this paper we propose an end-to-end algorithm for indirect data-driven control for bilinear systems with stability guarantees. We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.</p>

            <p>There is increasing interest in developing the theoretical foundations of networked control systems that illuminate how brain networks function so as to enable sensory perception, control of movement, memory and all the operations that are needed for animals to survive. The present paper proposes a biologically inspired network model featuring dynamic connections regulated by Hebbian learning. Drawing on the machinery of graph theory and classical control we show that our novel nonlinear model exhibits such biologically plausible features as bounded evolution, stability, resilience, and a kind of structural stability -- meaning that perturbations of the model parameters leave the essential properties of the model in tact. The proposed network model involves generalized cactus graphs with multiple control input nodes, and it is shown that the properties of the network are resilient to various changes in network topology provided these changes preserve the generalized cactus structure. A particular example described in what follows is an idealized network model of the visual system of a macaque monkey. The model displays resilience to network disruptions such as might occur in a living organism due to disease or injury. A different model of the same type provides an example of a system that can perform data classification.</p>

This paper provides analytical proof and numerical validation that radiative heat load is minimized by the same trajectory that minimizes the final {\Delta} V: a single switch bang-bang trajectory, starting with lift up. The proof is very general and is valid for several formulations of radiative heat flux; further, the same proof can be used to conclude that convective heat load, computed according to many of the available formulations, is instead maximized by that trajectory. Further, a novel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the attitude kinematics is introduced. While achieving performance similar to that of the current state-of-the-art, the inclusion of constraints in attitude kinematics allows for much less tuning. Finally, a lateral guidance that makes use of information on the final inclination of the predicted trajectory is introduced. Such guidance allows for very high accuracy in the inclination requirements with only two reversals, by requiring a single parameter to be tuned.</p>

            <h2>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Bhan, Peijia Qin, Miroslav Krstic, Yuanyuan Shi</p>
            <p>Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.</p>

            <h2>Domain-Agnostic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Using Physics-Constrained Synthetic Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam Chalcroft, Jenny Crinion, Cathy J. Price, John Ashburner</p>
            <p>Segmenting stroke lesions in MRI is challenging due to diverse acquisition protocols that limit model generalisability. In this work, we introduce two physics-constrained approaches to generate synthetic quantitative MRI (qMRI) images that improve segmentation robustness across heterogeneous domains. Our first method, $\texttt{qATLAS}$, trains a neural network to estimate qMRI maps from standard MPRAGE images, enabling the simulation of varied MRI sequences with realistic tissue contrasts. The second method, $\texttt{qSynth}$, synthesises qMRI maps directly from tissue labels using label-conditioned Gaussian mixture models, ensuring physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on multiple out-of-domain datasets show that both methods outperform a baseline UNet, with $\texttt{qSynth}$ notably surpassing previous synthetic data approaches. These results highlight the promise of integrating MRI physics into synthetic data generation for robust, generalisable stroke lesion segmentation. Code is available at this https URL</p>

            <p>We study the problem of learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) from input-output data. The mixture setting allows us to leverage observations from related dynamical systems to improve the estimation of individual models. Building on spectral methods for mixtures of linear regressions, we propose a moment-based estimator that uses tensor decomposition to estimate the impulse response parameters of the mixture models. The estimator improves upon existing tensor decomposition approaches for MLDS by utilizing the entire length of the observed trajectories. We provide sample complexity bounds for estimating MLDS in the presence of noise, in terms of both the number of trajectories $N$ and the trajectory length $T$, and demonstrate the performance of the estimator through simulations.</p>

            <p>Brain tumors can lead to neurological dysfunction, cognitive and psychological changes, increased intracranial pressure, and seizures, posing significant risks to health. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) series has shown superior accuracy in medical imaging object detection. This paper presents a novel SCC-YOLO architecture that integrates the SCConv module into YOLOv9. The SCConv module optimizes convolutional efficiency by reducing spatial and channel redundancy, enhancing image feature learning. We examine the effects of different attention mechanisms with YOLOv9 for brain tumor detection using the Br35H dataset and our custom dataset (Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Results indicate that SCC-YOLO improved mAP50 by 0.3% on the Br35H dataset and by 0.5% on our custom dataset compared to YOLOv9.

            <p>Image restoration aims to recover content from inputs degraded by various factors, such as adverse weather, blur, and noise. Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p>

            <p>Current speech encoding pipelines often rely on an additional text-based LM to get robust representations of human communication, even though SotA speech-to-text models often have a LM within. This work proposes an approach to improve the LM within an audio model such that the subsequent text-LM is unnecessary. We introduce WhiSPA (Whisper with Semantic and Psychological Alignment), which leverages a novel audio training objective: contrastive loss with a language model embedding as a teacher. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper's latent space with semantic representations from a text autoencoder (SBERT) and lexically derived embeddings of basic psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised affective tasks and downstream psychological tasks, WhiSPA surpasses current speech encoders, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% and 83.8%, respectively. WhiSPA demonstrates that it is not always necessary to run a subsequent text LM on speech-to-text output in order to get a rich psychological representation of human communication.</p>

            <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm, enabling energy-efficient data processing through spike-based information transmission. Despite notable advancements in hardware for SNNs, spike encoding has largely remained software-dependent, limiting efficiency. This paper addresses the need for adaptable and resource-efficient spike encoding hardware by presenting an area-optimized hardware implementation of the Spiketrum algorithm, which encodes time-varying analogue signals into spatiotemporal spike patterns. Unlike earlier performance-optimized designs, which prioritize speed, our approach focuses on reducing hardware footprint, achieving a 52% reduction in Block RAMs (BRAMs), 31% fewer Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slices, and a 6% decrease in Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The proposed implementation has been verified on an FPGA and successfully integrated into an IC using TSMC180 technology. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world applications, including sound and ECG classification. This work highlights the trade-offs between performance and resource efficiency, offering a flexible, scalable solution for neuromorphic systems in power-sensitive applications like cochlear implants and neural devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Titus Griebel, Anwai Archit, Constantin Pape</p>
            <p>Nucleus segmentation is an important analysis task in digital pathology. However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation.

            <p>Generating street-view images from satellite imagery is a challenging task, particularly in maintaining accurate pose alignment and incorporating diverse environmental conditions. While diffusion models have shown promise in generative tasks, their ability to maintain strict pose alignment throughout the diffusion process is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Iterative Homography Adjustment (IHA) scheme applied during the denoising process, which effectively addresses pose misalignment and ensures spatial consistency in the generated street-view images. Additionally, currently, available datasets for satellite-to-street-view generation are limited in their diversity of illumination and weather conditions, thereby restricting the generalizability of the generated outputs. To mitigate this, we introduce a text-guided illumination and weather-controlled sampling strategy that enables fine-grained control over the environmental factors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves pose accuracy and enhances the diversity and realism of generated street-view images, setting a new benchmark for satellite-to-street-view generation tasks.</p>

            <h2>Towards Explainable Spoofed Speech Attribution and Detection:a Probabilistic Approach for Characterizing Speech Synthesizer Components</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jagabandhu Mishra, Manasi Chhibber, Hye-jin Shim, Tomi H. Kinnunen</p>
            <p>We propose an explainable probabilistic framework for characterizing spoofed speech by decomposing it into probabilistic attribute embeddings. Unlike raw high-dimensional countermeasure embeddings, which lack interpretability, the proposed probabilistic attribute embeddings aim to detect specific speech synthesizer components, represented through high-level attributes and their corresponding values. We use these probabilistic embeddings with four classifier back-ends to address two downstream tasks: spoofing detection and spoofing attack attribution. The former is the well-known bonafide-spoof detection task, whereas the latter seeks to identify the source method (generator) of a spoofed utterance. We additionally use Shapley values, a widely used technique in machine learning, to quantify the relative contribution of each attribute value to the decision-making process in each task. Results on the ASVspoof2019 dataset demonstrate the substantial role of duration and conversion modeling in spoofing detection; and waveform generation and speaker modeling in spoofing attack attribution. In the detection task, the probabilistic attribute embeddings achieve $99.7\%$ balanced accuracy and $0.22\%$ equal error rate (EER), closely matching the performance of raw embeddings ($99.9\%$ balanced accuracy and $0.22\%$ EER). Similarly, in the attribution task, our embeddings achieve $90.23\%$ balanced accuracy and $2.07\%$ EER, compared to $90.16\%$ and $2.11\%$ with raw embeddings. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework is both inherently explainable by design and capable of achieving performance comparable to raw CM embeddings.</p>

            <p>We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of channel estimation in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To overcome the constraints of limited link budgets and communication rates associated with single-satellite-based communication, we develop a multi-LEO satellite cooperative beamforming strategy for downlink communication, capitalizing on the benefit of cluster-wise satellites cooperation. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Guo, Luis D. Couto</p>
            <p>This study evaluates numerical discretization methods for the Single Particle Model (SPM) used in electrochemical modeling. The methods include the Finite Difference Method (FDM), spectral methods, Padé approximation, and parabolic approximation. Evaluation criteria are accuracy, execution time, and memory usage, aiming to guide method selection for electrochemical models. Under constant current conditions, the FDM explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta methods show significant errors, while the FDM implicit Euler method improves accuracy with more nodes. The spectral method achieves the best accuracy and convergence with as few as five nodes. The Padé approximation exhibits increasing errors with higher current, and the parabolic approximation shows higher errors than the converged spectral and FDM implicit Euler methods. Under dynamic conditions, frequency domain analysis indicates that the FDM, spectral, and Padé approximation methods improve high-frequency response by increasing node count or method order. In terms of execution time, the parabolic method is fastest, followed by the Padé approximation. The spectral method is faster than FDM, while the FDM implicit Euler method is the slowest. Memory usage is lowest for the parabolic and Padé methods, moderate for FDM, and highest for the spectral method. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting discretization methods under different operating scenarios.</p>

            <p>Frequency-domain performance analysis of intersample behavior in sampled-data and multirate systems is challenging due to the lack of a frequency-separation principle, and systematic identification techniques are lacking. The aim of this \manuscript is to develop an efficient technique for identifying the full intersample performance in the frequency-domain for closed-loop multirate systems, in particular the Performance Frequency Gain (PFG). Through local modeling techniques, aliased frequency components are effectively disentangled when identifying the PFG, which is directly facilitated by frequency-lifting the multirate system to a multivariable time-invariant representation. The developed method accurately and directly identifies the PFG in a single identification experiment. Finally, the developed method is experimentally validated on a prototype motion system, showing accurate identification of frequency-domain representations for the multirate system, including the PFG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alvin Combrink, Sabino Francesco Roselli, Martin Fabian</p>
            <p>Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning collision-free movements of agents so that they get from where they are to where they need to be. Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This problem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such variations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the former, edges have non-unit lengths and volumetric agents can traverse them at any real-valued time. In the latter, agents must attend to a continuous stream of incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods within these two areas. To our knowledge, however, the combined problem of continuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed. This work addresses continuous-time lifelong MAPF with volumetric agents by presenting the fast and sub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP continuously assigns agents to tasks and computes plans using a combination of two path planners; one based on CCBS and the other based on SIPP. Experimental results with up to 800 agents on graphs with up to 12 000 vertices demonstrate practical performance, where maximum planning times fall within the available time budget. Additionally, CPLP ensures collision-free movement even when failing to meet this budget. Therefore, the robustness of CPLP highlights its potential for real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary</p>
            <p>Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?" This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost. Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</p>

By directly incorporating uncertainties from environmental conditions and spacecraft dynamics, an optimal sequence of actions is computed that maximizes expected rewards and strictly enforces safety constraints.

            <p>In this study, we investigate the impact of positional encoding (PE) on source separation performance and the generalization ability to long sequences (length extrapolation) in Transformer-based time-frequency (TF) domain dual-path models. The length extrapolation capability in TF-domain dual-path models is a crucial factor, as it affects not only their performance on long-duration inputs but also their generalizability to signals with unseen sampling rates. While PE is known to significantly impact length extrapolation, there has been limited research that explores the choice of PEs for TF-domain dual-path models from this perspective. To address this gap, we compare various PE methods using a recent state-of-the-art model, TF-Locoformer, as the base architecture. Our analysis yields the following key findings: (i) When handling sequences that are the same length as or shorter than those seen during training, models with PEs achieve better performance. (ii) However, models without PE exhibit superior length extrapolation. This trend is particularly pronounced when the model contains convolutional layers.</p>

            <p>Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), the nonlinear mapping relationship between sensory and communication information serves as a powerful tool to enhance both the accuracy and generalization of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To explore the general mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new intelligent sensing-communication integration dataset, named V2V-M3, is constructed for multiple scenarios in V2V communications with multiple frequency bands and multiple vehicular traffic densities (VTDs). Leveraging the strong representation and cross-modal inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a novel LLM-based method for Scatterer Generation (LLM4SG) from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds is developed. To address the inherent and significant differences across multi-modal data, synergistically optimized four-module architecture, i.e., preprocessor, embedding, backbone, and output modules, are designed by considering the sensing/channel characteristics and electromagnetic propagation mechanism. On the basis of cross-modal representation alignment and positional encoding, the network of LLM4SG is fine-tuned to capture the general mapping relationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4SG achieves superior performance in full-sample and generalization testing, significantly outperforming small models across different frequency bands, scenarios, and VTDs.</p>

            <p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world clinical applications.</p>

            <p>Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness, and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments. On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction, reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset, SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.</p>

            <h2>VoiceStar: Robust Zero-Shot Autoregressive TTS with Duration Control and Extrapolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Puyuan Peng, Shang-Wen Li, Abdelrahman Mohamed, David Harwath</p>
            <p>We present VoiceStar, the first zero-shot TTS model that achieves both output duration control and extrapolation. VoiceStar is an autoregressive encoder-decoder neural codec language model, that leverages a novel Progress-Monitoring Rotary Position Embedding (PM-RoPE) and is trained with Continuation-Prompt Mixed (CPM) training. PM-RoPE enables the model to better align text and speech tokens, indicates the target duration for the generated speech, and also allows the model to generate speech waveforms much longer in duration than those seen during. CPM training also helps to mitigate the training/inference mismatch, and significantly improves the quality of the generated speech in terms of speaker similarity and intelligibility. VoiceStar outperforms or is on par with current state-of-the-art models on short-form benchmarks such as Librispeech and Seed-TTS, and significantly outperforms these models on long-form/extrapolation benchmarks (20-50s) in terms of intelligibility and naturalness.

            <h2>Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Through Cross Modal Attention Alignment and Balanced Stacking Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Ueda, João Lima, Leonardo Marques, Paula Costa</p>
            <p>Emotion plays a fundamental role in human interaction, and therefore systems capable of identifying emotions in speech are crucial in the context of human-computer interaction. Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging problem, particularly in natural speech and when the available data is imbalanced across emotions. This paper presents our proposed system in the context of the 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge. Our proposed architecture leverages cross-modality, utilizing cross-modal attention to fuse representations from different modalities. To address class imbalance, we employed two training designs: (i) weighted crossentropy loss (WCE); and (ii) WCE with an additional neutralexpressive soft margin loss and balancing. We trained a total of 12 multimodal models, which were ensembled using a balanced stacking model. Our proposed system achieves a MacroF1 score of 0.4094 and an accuracy of 0.4128 on 8-class speech emotion recognition.</p>

            <p>There has been a growing effort to develop universal speech enhancement (SE) to handle inputs with various speech distortions and recording conditions. The URGENT Challenge series aims to foster such universal SE by embracing a broad range of distortion types, increasing data diversity, and incorporating extensive evaluation metrics. This work introduces the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge, the second edition of the series, to explore several aspects that have received limited attention so far: language dependency, universality for more distortion types, data scalability, and the effectiveness of using noisy training data. We received 32 submissions, where the best system uses a discriminative model, while most other competitive ones are hybrid methods. Analysis reveals some key findings: (i) some generative or hybrid approaches are preferred in subjective evaluations over the top discriminative model, and (ii) purely generative SE models can exhibit language dependency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunliang Qi, Meng Lou, Yimin Liu, Lu Li, Zhen Yang, Wen Nie</p>
            <p>Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques. Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods, particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR scenarios.</p>

            <p>Super-resolution aims to increase the resolution of satellite images by reconstructing high-frequency details, which go beyond naïve upsampling. This has particular relevance for Earth observation missions like Sentinel-2, which offer frequent, regular coverage at no cost; but at coarse resolution. Its pixel footprint is too large to capture small features like houses, streets, or hedge rows. To address this, we present SEN4X, a hybrid super-resolution architecture that combines the advantages of single-image and multi-image techniques. It combines temporal oversampling from repeated Sentinel-2 acquisitions with a learned prior from high-resolution Pléiades Neo data. In doing so, SEN4X upgrades Sentinel-2 imagery to 2.5 m ground sampling distance. We test the super-resolved images on urban land-cover classification in Hanoi, Vietnam. We find that they lead to a significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art super-resolution baselines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Razi Mahmood, Diego Machado Reyes, Ge Wang, Mannudeep Kalra, Pingkun Yan</p>
            <p>With advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to produce realistic-looking automated reports for preliminary reads of radiology images. This can expedite clinical workflows, improve accuracy and reduce overall costs. However, it is also well-known that such models often hallucinate, leading to false findings in the generated reports. In this paper, we propose a new method of fact-checking of AI-generated reports using their associated images. Specifically, the developed examiner differentiates real and fake sentences in reports by learning the association between an image and sentences describing real or potentially fake findings. To train such an examiner, we first created a new dataset of fake reports by perturbing the findings in the original ground truth radiology reports associated with images. Text encodings of real and fake sentences drawn from these reports are then paired with image encodings to learn the mapping to real/fake labels. The utility of such an examiner is demonstrated for verifying automatically generated reports by detecting and removing fake sentences. Future generative AI approaches can use the resulting tool to validate their reports leading to a more responsible use of AI in expediting clinical workflows.</p>

            <h2>Sampling and Uniqueness Sets in Graphon Signal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Parada-Mayorga, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the properties of sampling sets on families of large graphs by leveraging the theory of graphons and graph limits. To this end, we extend to graphon signals the notion of removable and uniqueness sets, which was developed originally for the analysis of signals on graphs. We state the formal definition of a $\Lambda-$removable set and conditions under which a bandlimited graphon signal can be represented in a unique way when its samples are obtained from the complement of a given $\Lambda-$removable set in the graphon. By leveraging such results we show that graphon representations of graphs and graph signals can be used as a common framework to compare sampling sets between graphs with different numbers of nodes and edges, and different node labelings. Additionally, given a sequence of graphs that converges to a graphon, we show that the sequences of sampling sets whose graphon representation is identical in $[0,1]$ are convergent as well. We exploit the convergence results to provide an algorithm that obtains approximately close to optimal sampling sets. Performing a set of numerical experiments, we evaluate the quality of these sampling sets. Our results open the door for the efficient computation of optimal sampling sets in graphs of large size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuangrui Ding, Zihan Liu, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Rui Qian, Junhao Huang, Conghui He, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
            <p>Creating lyrics and melodies for the vocal track in a symbolic format, known as song composition, demands expert musical knowledge of melody, an advanced understanding of lyrics, and precise alignment between them. Despite achievements in sub-tasks such as lyric generation, lyric-to-melody, and melody-to-lyric, etc, a unified model for song composition has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we introduce SongComposer, a pioneering step towards a unified song composition model that can readily create symbolic lyrics and melodies following instructions. SongComposer is a music-specialized large language model (LLM) that, for the first time, integrates the capability of simultaneously composing lyrics and melodies into LLMs by leveraging three key innovations: 1) a flexible tuple format for word-level alignment of lyrics and melodies, 2) an extended tokenizer vocabulary for song notes, with scalar initialization based on musical knowledge to capture rhythm, and 3) a multi-stage pipeline that captures musical structure, starting with motif-level melody patterns and progressing to phrase-level structure for improved coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SongComposer outperforms advanced LLMs, including GPT-4, in tasks such as lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song creation. Moreover, we will release SongCompose, a large-scale dataset for training, containing paired lyrics and melodies in Chinese and English.</p>

            <p>In this work, a delay-tolerant unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relayed covert and secure communication framework is investigated. In this framework, a legitimate UAV serves as an aerial relay to realize communication when the direct link between the terrestrial transmitter and receiver is blocked and also acts as a friendly jammer to suppress the malicious nodes presented on the ground. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty of malicious nodes' positions, a robust fractional programming optimization problem is built to maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit power of the transmitter, and the time-switching factor. For the extremely complicated covert constraint, Pinsker's inequality, Jensen's inequality, and the bisection search method are employed to construct a tractable shrunken one. After this, an alternate optimization-based algorithm is proposed to solve the fractional programming optimization problem. To achieve low complexity, we design the primal-dual search-based algorithm and the successive convex approximation-based algorithm, respectively, for each sub-problem. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Wen, Hong Xing, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
            <p>For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of neural state estimation in power distribution systems. We identified a research gap in the current state of the art, which lies in the inability of models to adapt to changes in the power grid, such as loss of sensors and branch switching, in a zero-shot fashion. Based on the literature, we identified graph neural networks as the most promising class of models for this use case. Our experiments confirm their robustness to some grid changes and also show that a deeper network does not always perform better. We propose data augmentations to improve performance and conduct a comprehensive grid search of different model configurations for common zero-shot learning scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Agile Decision-Making and Safety-Critical Motion Planning for Emergency Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiming Shu, Jingyuan Zhou, Fu Zhang</p>
            <p>Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially for emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the distinct strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focuses on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively attain efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple paths generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with an output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental conditions to decide constraints states for the final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimal optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiantian Feng, Anfeng Xu, Xuan Shi, Somer Bishop, Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
            <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social communication, repetitive behavior, and sensory processing. One important research area in ASD is evaluating children's behavioral changes over time during treatment. The standard protocol with this objective is BOSCC, which involves dyadic interactions between a child and clinicians performing a pre-defined set of activities. A fundamental aspect of understanding children's behavior in these interactions is automatic speech understanding, particularly identifying who speaks and when. Conventional approaches in this area heavily rely on speech samples recorded from a spectator perspective, and there is limited research on egocentric speech modeling. In this study, we design an experiment to perform speech sampling in BOSCC interviews from an egocentric perspective using wearable sensors and explore pre-training Ego4D speech samples to enhance child-adult speaker classification in dyadic interactions. Our findings highlight the potential of egocentric speech collection and pre-training to improve speaker classification accuracy.</p>

            <p>Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life. While deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these disorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although differential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its application in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite the equally critical privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with high privacy levels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we demonstrated the vulnerability of non-private models to gradient inversion attacks, reconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's effectiveness in mitigating these risks. To explore the potential generalizability across languages and disorders, we validated our approach on a dataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained models from healthy English-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful pretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable accuracy under DP constraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed minimal gender bias at reasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for addressing age-related disparities. Our results establish that DP can balance privacy and utility in speech disorder detection, while highlighting unique challenges in privacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a foundation for refining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse patient groups in real-world deployments.</p>

We evaluate AfriHuBERT on two key speech tasks, Spoken Language Identification (SLID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), using the FLEURS benchmark. Our results show a +3.6% F1 score improvement for SLID and a -2.1% average Word Error Rate (WER) reduction for ASR over mHuBERT-147, and demonstrates competitiveness with larger SSL models such as MMS and XEUS. Further analysis shows that ASR models trained on AfriHuBERT exhibit improved cross-corpus generalization and are competitive in extremely low-resource ASR scenarios.</p>

            <p>Generating high-quality 3D content from text, single images, or sparse view images remains a challenging task with broad applications. Existing methods typically employ multi-view diffusion models to synthesize multi-view images, followed by a feed-forward process for 3D reconstruction. However, these approaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views, limiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading to suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality. To address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework capable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The first stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We employ a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion model to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of the target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these views based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and reliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated views are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a transformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of inputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane representation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation. Through extensive exploration of design and training strategies, we optimize FlexRM to achieve superior performance in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Flex3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a user study winning rate of over 92% in 3D generation tasks when compared to several of the latest feed-forward 3D generative models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guoqiang Wu, Cheng Hu, Wangjia Weng, Zhouheng Li, Yonghao Fu, Lei Xie, Hongye Su</p>
            <p>Extreme cornering in racing often leads to large sideslip angles, presenting a significant challenge for vehicle control. Conventional vehicle controllers struggle to manage this scenario, necessitating the use of a drifting controller. However, the large sideslip angle in drift conditions introduces model mismatch, which in turn affects control precision. To address this issue, we propose a model correction drift controller that integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is employed to correct vehicle model mismatches during both drift equilibrium solving and the MPC optimization process. Additionally, the variance from GPR is utilized to actively explore different cornering drifting velocities, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments with a 1:10 scale RC vehicle. In the simulation, the average lateral error with GPR is reduced by 52.8% compared to the non-GPR case. Incorporating exploration further decreases this error by 27.1%. The velocity tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also decreases by 10.6% with exploration. In the RC car experiment, the average lateral error with GPR is 36.7% lower, and exploration further leads to a 29.0% reduction. Moreover, the velocity tracking RMSE decreases by 7.2% with the inclusion of exploration.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we develop a generalized theory of convolutional signal processing and neural networks for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Leveraging the theory of algebraic signal processing (ASP), we show that any RKHS allows the formal definition of multiple algebraic convolutional models. We show that any RKHS induces algebras whose elements determine convolutional operators acting on RKHS elements. This approach allows us to achieve scalable filtering and learning as a byproduct of the convolutional model, and simultaneously take advantage of the well-known benefits of processing information in an RKHS. To emphasize the generality and usefulness of our approach, we show how algebraic RKHS can be used to define convolutional signal models on groups, graphons, and traditional Euclidean signal spaces. Furthermore, using algebraic RKHS models, we build convolutional networks, formally defining the notion of pointwise nonlinearities and deriving explicit expressions for the training. Such derivations are obtained in terms of the algebraic representation of the RKHS. We present a set of numerical experiments on real data in which wireless coverage is predicted from measurements captured by unmaned aerial vehicles. This particular real-life scenario emphasizes the benefits of the convolutional RKHS models in neural networks compared to fully connected and standard convolutional operators.</p>

            <p>The denoising process of diffusion models can be interpreted as an approximate projection of noisy samples onto the data manifold. Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p>

Our baseline system employs a simple CNN-based classification using three different spectrogram features. Results demonstrate the feasibility of automated ASD detection, with the considered audible-range features achieving the best performance (UAR of 0.600 for segment-level and 0.625 for subject-level classification). This challenge bridges speech technology and biomedical research, offering opportunities to advance our understanding of ASD models through machine learning approaches.

            <p>In Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), pre-training and evaluation are resource intensive. In the speech domain, current indicators of the quality of SSL models during pre-training, such as the loss, do not correlate well with downstream performance.

In this work, we propose unsupervised efficient methods that give insights into the quality of the pre-training of SSL speech models, namely, measuring the cluster quality and rank of the embeddings of the SSL model. Results show that measures of cluster quality and rank correlate better with downstream performance than the pre-training loss with only one hour of unlabeled audio, reducing the need for GPU hours and labeled data in SSL model evaluation.</p>

            <p>Datasets play a critical role in medical imaging research, yet issues such as label quality, shortcuts, and metadata are often overlooked. This lack of attention may harm the generalizability of algorithms and, consequently, negatively impact patient outcomes. While existing medical imaging literature reviews mostly focus on machine learning (ML) methods, with only a few focusing on datasets for specific applications, these reviews remain static -- they are published once and not updated thereafter. This fails to account for emerging evidence, such as biases, shortcuts, and additional annotations that other researchers may contribute after the dataset is published. We refer to these newly discovered findings of datasets as research artifacts. To address this gap, we propose a living review that continuously tracks public datasets and their associated research artifacts across multiple medical imaging applications. Our approach includes a framework for the living review to monitor data documentation artifacts, and an SQL database to visualize the citation relationships between research artifact and dataset. Lastly, we discuss key considerations for creating medical imaging datasets, review best practices for data annotation, discuss the significance of shortcuts and demographic diversity, and emphasize the importance of managing datasets throughout their entire lifecycle.

            <h2>Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Cheng, Erjia Xiao, Jing Shao, Yichi Wang, Le Yang, Chao Shen, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant security risks, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attack. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific Jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Jailbreak-AudioBench}, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sukkeun Kim, Sangwoo Moon, Ivan Petrunin, Hyo-Sang Shin, Shehryar Khattak</p>
            <p>This study proposes a new Gaussian Mixture Filter (GMF) to improve the estimation performance for the autonomous robotic radio signal source search and localization problem in unknown environments. The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-the-practice approaches such as Particle Filter (PF) and Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters. Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</p>

            <h2>Distances between finite-horizon linear behaviors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Padoan, Jeremy Coulson</p>
            <p>The paper introduces a class of distances for linear behaviors over finite time horizons. These distances allow for comparisons between finite-horizon linear behaviors represented by matrices of possibly different dimensions. They remain invariant under coordinate changes, rotations, and permutations, ensuring independence from input-output partitions. Moreover, they naturally encode complexity-misfit trade-offs for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) behaviors, providing a principled solution to a longstanding puzzle in behavioral systems theory. The resulting framework characterizes modeling as a minimum distance problem, identifying the Most Powerful Unfalsified Model (MPUM) as optimal among all systems unfalsified by a given dataset. Finally, we illustrate the value of these metrics in a time series anomaly detection task, where their finer resolution yields superior performance over existing distances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinquan Wang, Fenghao Zhu, Chongwen Huang, Zhaohui Yang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Sami Muhaidat, Chau Yuen, Mérouane Debbah</p>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized domains like telecommunication (Telecom) due to technical complexity, specialized terminology, and rapidly evolving knowledge. Traditional methods, such as scaling model parameters or retraining on domain-specific corpora, are computationally expensive and yield diminishing returns, while existing approaches like retrieval-augmented generation, mixture of experts, and fine-tuning struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and coordination. To address this issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making in Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages strengths of diverse models to improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7\% increase in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in Telecom applications.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Movable Antennas in Wideband Multi-User MIMO With Hardware Impairments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amna Irshad, Emil Björnson, Alva Kosasih, Vitaly Petrov</p>
            <p>Movable antennas represent an emerging field in telecommunication research and a potential approach to achieving higher data rates in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications when the total number of antennas is limited. Most solutions and analyses to date have been limited to \emph{narrowband} setups. This work complements the prior studies by quantifying the benefit of using movable antennas in \emph{wideband} MIMO communication systems. First, we derive a novel uplink wideband system model that also accounts for distortion from transceiver hardware impairments. We then formulate and solve an optimization task to maximize the average sum rate by adjusting the antenna positions using particle swarm optimization. Finally, the performance with movable antennas is compared with fixed uniform arrays and the derived theoretical upper bound. The numerical study concludes that the data rate improvement from movable antennas over other arrays heavily depends on the level of hardware impairments, the richness of the multi-path environments, and the number of subcarriers. The present study provides vital insights into the most suitable use cases for movable antennas in future wideband systems.</p>

            <h2>OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolaos Louloudakis, Ajitha Rajan</p>
            <p>With over 700 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil M. Pawar, Jorge A. Prozzi, Feng Hong, Surya Sarat Chandra Congress</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been an impetus for the application of cutting-edge data collection platforms such as drones mounted with camera sensors for infrastructure asset management. However, the sensor characteristics, proximity to the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often limit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution techniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these techniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of distress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images i.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the pre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this study developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately classified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution technique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress obtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the evaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the combination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the infrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost and false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection showed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of even minor cracks. The proposed framework is expected to help the highway agencies in accurately performing distress detection and assist in efficient asset management practices.</p>

            <h2>Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Corenflos</p>
            <p>Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodan Shao, Rui Zhang, Haibo Zhou, Qijun Jiang, Conghao Zhou, Weihua Zhuang, Xuemin Shen</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel polarforming antenna (PA) to achieve cost-effective wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, the PA can enable polarforming to adaptively control the antenna's polarization electrically as well as tune its position/rotation mechanically, so as to effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study an PA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an PA-equipped base station (BS) and PA-equipped users. First, we model the PA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna positions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in the slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the optimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed user locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming is adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with the optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new polarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain pattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components in the PA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate of users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming, including phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale antenna rotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the performance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alvin Combrink, Stephie Do, Kristofer Bengtsson, Sabino Francesco Roselli, Martin Fabian</p>
            <p>The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However, the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades, with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to outperform standard mathematical programming techniques. In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of personnel scheduling.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models have produced remarkably realistic audio deepfakes. We refer to deepfake speech generated by CoSG systems as codec-based deepfake, or CodecFake. Although existing anti-spoofing research on CodecFake predominantly focuses on verifying the authenticity of audio samples, almost no attention was given to tracing the CoSG used in generating these deepfakes. In CodecFake generation, processes such as speech-to-unit encoding, discrete unit modeling, and unit-to-speech decoding are fundamentally based on neural audio codecs. Motivated by this, we introduce source tracing for CodecFake via neural audio codec taxonomy, which dissects neural audio codecs to trace CoSG. Our experimental results on the CodecFake+ dataset provide promising initial evidence for the feasibility of CodecFake source tracing while also highlighting several challenges that warrant further investigation.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the development of a wearable ankle rehabilitation robot based on a 3-RRR spherical parallel mechanism (SPM) to support multi-DOF recovery through pitch, roll, and yaw motions. The system features a compact, ergonomic structure designed for comfort, safety, and compatibility with ankle biomechanics. A complete design-to-dynamics pipeline has been implemented, including structural design, kinematic modeling for motion planning, and Lagrangian-based dynamic modeling for torque estimation and simulation analysis. Preliminary simulations verify stable joint coordination and smooth motion tracking under representative rehabilitation trajectories. The control framework is currently being developed to enhance responsiveness across the workspace. Future work will focus on integrating personalized modeling and adaptive strategies to address kinematic singularities through model based control. This work establishes a foundational platform for intelligent, personalized ankle rehabilitation, enabling both static training and potential extension to gait-phase-timed assistance.</p>

These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.</p>

It includes diverse acoustic conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate (EER) surging from 4.7% to 18.2%. Even with adaptive Room Impulse Response (RIR) retraining, performance remains compromised with an 11.0% EER. We release ReplayDF for non-commercial research use.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunsuke Kando, Yusuke Miyao, Shinnosuke Takamichi</p>
            <p>The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.</p>

            <p>Music-driven 3D dance generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, with promising applications in choreography, virtual reality, and creative content creation. Previous research has generated promising realistic dance movement from audio signals. However, traditional methods underutilize genre conditioning, often treating it as auxiliary modifiers rather than core semantic drivers. This oversight compromises music-motion synchronization and disrupts dance genre continuity, particularly during complex rhythmic transitions, thereby leading to visually unsatisfactory effects. To address the challenge, we propose MEGADance, a novel architecture for music-driven 3D dance generation. By decoupling choreographic consistency into dance generality and genre specificity, MEGADance demonstrates significant dance quality and strong genre controllability. It consists of two stages: (1) High-Fidelity Dance Quantization Stage (HFDQ), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and reconstructs them with kinematic-dynamic constraints, and (2) Genre-Aware Dance Generation Stage (GADG), which maps music into the latent representation by synergistic utilization of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with Mamba-Transformer hybrid backbone. Extensive experiments on the FineDance and AIST++ dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MEGADance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A Fessler, Laura Balzano</p>
            <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that come from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-focused subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms. Code available at this https URL.</p>

In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.</p>

            <p>Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally. Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a training method which can improve interspeaker consistency using only speech data.</p>

            <p>Polarforming emerges as a promising technique for manipulating the polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves by shaping the polarization of an antenna into a desired state. By dynamically adjusting antenna polarization, polarforming enables real-time polarization matching or mismatching with received EM waves, thereby leveraging polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance wireless communication performance. In this article, we first present an overview of the fundamental principles and design approaches underlying the polarforming technique. We then analyze the key advantages of polarforming, including hardware cost reduction, depolarization mitigation, channel adaptation, signal power enhancement, and interference suppression. Furthermore, we explore promising applications of polarforming for next-generation wireless networks. Numerical case studies demonstrate the substantial performance gains of polarforming over conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, along with a discussion of implementation challenges to motivate future research.</p>

            <h2>Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viraj Nadkarni, Pramod Viswanath</p>
            <p>We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.</p>

            <h2>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform: The "Twiddless" FFT Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saulo Queiroz</p>
            <p>In this work, we present the \emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)}, a novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point signal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT readily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing compression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the even-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by efficiently computing both \emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the compressed domain with $O(N \log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new recursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the original input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle factor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes the input length to $N = c \cdot 2^k$ (for $k \geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c > 0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency and stability over classical FFTs. We believe TFFT represents a \emph{novel paradigm} for DFT computation, opening new directions for research in optimized implementations, hardware design, parallel computation, and sparse transforms.</p>

            <h2>SpeechVerifier: Robust Acoustic Fingerprint against Tampering Attacks via Watermarking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lingfeng Yao, Chenpei Huang, Shengyao Wang, Junpei Xue, Hanqing Guo, Jiang Liu, Xun Chen, Miao Pan</p>
            <p>With the surge of social media, maliciously tampered public speeches, especially those from influential figures, have seriously affected social stability and public trust. Existing speech tampering detection methods remain insufficient: they either rely on external reference data or fail to be both sensitive to attacks and robust to benign operations, such as compression and resampling. To tackle these challenges, we introduce SpeechVerifer to proactively verify speech integrity using only the published speech itself, i.e., without requiring any external references. Inspired by audio fingerprinting and watermarking, SpeechVerifier can (i) effectively detect tampering attacks, (ii) be robust to benign operations and (iii) verify the integrity only based on published speeches. Briefly, SpeechVerifier utilizes multiscale feature extraction to capture speech features across different temporal resolutions. Then, it employs contrastive learning to generate fingerprints that can detect modifications at varying granularities. These fingerprints are designed to be robust to benign operations, but exhibit significant changes when malicious tampering occurs. To enable speech verification in a self-contained manner, the generated fingerprints are then embedded into the speech signal by segment-wise watermarking. Without external references, SpeechVerifier can retrieve the fingerprint from the published audio and check it with the embedded watermark to verify the integrity of the speech. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SpeechVerifier is effective in detecting tampering attacks and robust to benign operations.</p>

            <h2>MSDA: Combining Pseudo-labeling and Self-Supervision for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in ASR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Damianos, Georgios Paraskevopoulos, Alexandros Potamianos</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.</p>

            <h2>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiza Ribeiro, Alexandre Street, Jose Manuel Arroyo, Rodrigo Moreno</p>
            <p>The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</p>

            <h2>Damping LFOs: Grid Following with Power Oscillation Damping vs. Grid Forming vs. PSS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamojit Chakraborty, Anamitra Pal, Sam Maleki</p>
            <p>Low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) present a significant challenge to the stability and reliability of power systems, especially in grids with a high penetration of renewable energy sources. Traditional grid-following (GFL) inverters have proven less effective in damping such oscillations. This paper presents a GFL-power plant controller with an auxiliary power oscillation damping control for damping LFOs. This approach is compared with a traditional power system stabilizer (PSS) for a two-area power system. Next, the research is extended by deploying grid forming (GFM) controls, which by actively controlling the voltage and frequency dynamics emulate the behavior of traditional synchronous generators. The paper analyzes two GFM control strategies: virtual synchronous machine (VSM) and droop control, and demonstrates their effectiveness in damping LFOs in the test system. The simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed GFM-VSM rivals that of the PSS and is better than the GFL-power oscillation damper.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runjie Zhang, Kaiping Qu, Changhong Zhao, Wanjun Huang</p>
            <p>The integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into distribution networks introduces significant uncertainties and fluctuations, challenging their operational security, stability, and efficiency. This paper considers robust distribution network reconfiguration (RDNR) with renewable generator resizing, modeled as a two-stage robust optimization (RO) problem with decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). Our model optimizes resizing decisions as the upper bounds of renewable generator outputs, while also optimizing the network topology. We design a mapping-based column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm to address the computational challenges raised by DDU. Sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of uncertainty set parameters on optimal solutions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing computational complexity while ensuring solution optimality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omid Rezaei, Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh, Seyed Mohammad Karbasi, Mohammad Mahdi Nayebi</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with wireless power transfer (WPT) where multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based radars serve multiple clusters of energy-limited communication users in addition to their sensing functionality. In this architecture, the radars sense the environment in phase 1 (namely sensing phase) and meanwhile, the communications users (nodes) harvest and store the energy from the radar transmit signals. The stored energy is then used for information transmission from the nodes to UAVs in phase 2, i.e., uplink phase. Performance of the radar systems depends on the transmit signals as well as the receive filters; the energy of the transmit signals also affects the communication network because it serves as the source of uplink powers. Therefore, we cast a multi-objective design problem addressing performance of both radar and communication systems via optimizing UAV trajectories, radar transmit waveforms, radar receive filters, time scheduling and uplink powers. The design problem is further formulated as a robust non-convex optimization problem taking into account the the user location uncertainty. Hence, we devise a method based on alternating optimization followed by concepts of fractional programming, S-procedure, and tricky majorization-minimization (MM) technique to tackle it. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for different scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohan Li, Jiahao Liu, Junsheng Mu, Pei Xiao, Sheng Chen</p>
            <p>With line-of-sight mode deployment and fast response, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique, is poised to deliver high-quality communication and sensing services in maritime emergency scenarios. In practice, however, the real-time transmission of ISAC signals at the UAV side cannot be realized unless the reliable wireless fronthaul link between the terrestrial base station and UAV are available. This paper proposes a multicarrier-division duplex based joint fronthaul-access scheme, where mutually orthogonal subcarrier sets are leveraged to simultaneously support four types of fronthaul/access transmissions. In order to maximize the end-to-end communication rate while maintaining an adequate sensing quality-of-service (QoS) in such a complex scheme, the UAV trajectory, subcarrier assignment and power allocation are jointly optimized. The overall optimization process is designed in two stages. As the emergency area is usually far away from the coast, the optimal initial operating position for the UAV is first found. Once the UAV passes the initial operating position, the UAV's trajectory and resource allocation are optimized during the mission period to maximize the end-to-end communication rate under the constraint of minimum sensing QoS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in dealing with the joint fronthaul-access optimization problem in maritime ISAC networks, offering the advantages over benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p>Developing robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Arabic requires effective strategies to manage its diversity. Existing ASR systems mainly cover the modern standard Arabic (MSA) variety and few high-resource dialects, but fall short in coverage and generalization across the multitude of spoken variants. Code-switching with English and French is also common in different regions of the Arab world, which challenges the performance of monolingual Arabic models. In this work, we introduce a suite of ASR models optimized to effectively recognize multiple variants of spoken Arabic, including MSA, various dialects, and code-switching. We provide open-source pre-trained models that cover data from 17 Arabic-speaking countries, and fine-tuned MSA and dialectal ASR models that include at least 11 variants, as well as multi-lingual ASR models covering embedded languages in code-switched utterances. We evaluate ASR performance across these spoken varieties and demonstrate both coverage and performance gains compared to prior models.</p>

            <p>Voltage unbalance, caused by variations in voltage magnitude and phase angle, is a significant power quality issue in three-phase systems, leading to equipment inefficiencies and increased system losses. The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the grid adds complexity, as DER can either reduce or worsen voltage unbalance, depending on factors such as grid configuration and the distribution of loads and DER themselves. This study explores the effects of DER penetration on voltage unbalance levels and the accuracy of the different indices most commonly used to quantify this unbalance. The results highlight the varying impacts of DER on unbalance and index performance, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to assess voltage unbalance in modern distribution systems.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.

            <h2>Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thuan Pham, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauren Streitmatter, Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>Many resources in the grid connect to power grids via programmable grid-interfacing inverters that can provide grid services and offer greater control flexibility and faster response times compared to synchronous generators. However, the current through the inverter needs to be limited to protect the semiconductor components. Existing controllers are designed using somewhat ad hoc methods, for example, by adding current limiters to preexisting control loops, which can lead to stability issues or overly conservative operations. In this paper, we study the geometry of the feasible output region of a current-limited inverter. We show that under a commonly used model, the feasible region is convex. We provide an explicit characterization of this region, which allows us to efficiently find the optimal operating points of the inverter. We demonstrate how knowing the feasible set and its convexity allows us to improve upon existing grid-forming inverters such that their steady-state currents always remain within the current magnitude limit, whereas standard grid-forming controllers can lead to instabilities and violations.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the capability of off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem. ED is a hard-constrained optimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to minimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and engineering constraints. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these typically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or depend on extensive labeled data and training time. This work implements LLMs enhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED problem. The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical formulations, does not suffer from convergence challenges, and requires neither labeled data nor extensive training. A few-shot learning technique is utilized in two different prompting contexts. The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation units serves as the evaluation benchmark. Results demonstrate that various prompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering a convenient and efficient alternative. Consequently, this approach presents a promising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power system models are available.</p>

            <p>The proliferation of distributed renewable energy triggers the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market formations. To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p>

To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a novel framework that employs a neural network approximation of the optimal solution map of the QP. The resulting method has two key features: (a) it ensures that the DERs' setpoints are practically feasible, even for an online implementation or when an offline algorithm has an early termination; (b) it ensures convergence to a neighborhood of a strict local optimizer of the AC OPF. The proposed method is tested on a 93-node distribution system with realistic loads and renewable generation.

            <p>The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</p>

Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</p>

            <h2>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part I: Computing with Microwave Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this two-part paper, we explore analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing and communications. In Part I of this paper, we model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, enabling the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and matrix inversion, with remarkably low computational complexity. Specifically, a matrix can be inverted with complexity growing with the square of its size. We also show how a MiLAC can be used jointly with digital operations to implement sophisticated algorithms such as the Kalman filter. To enhance practicability, we propose a design of MiLAC based on lossless impedance components, reducing power consumption and eliminating the need for costly active components. In Part II of this paper, we investigate the applications of MiLACs in wireless communications, highlighting their potential to enable future wireless systems by executing computations and beamforming in the analog domain.</p>

            <h2>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part II: Toward Gigantic MIMO Beamforming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>Analog-domain operations offer a promising solution to accelerating signal processing and enabling future multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with thousands of antennas. In Part I of this paper, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In Part II of this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic MIMO beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming enables the maximum flexibility and performance of digital beamforming, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of zero-forcing (ZF), which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. It also processes signals with fixed matrices, e.g., the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), directly in the analog domain. Numerical results show that it can perform ZF and DFT with a computational complexity reduction of up to $1.5\times 10^4$ and $4.0\times 10^7$ times, respectively, compared to digital beamforming.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic Control Improves Residential Building Energy and EV Management when PV Capacity is High but Battery Capacity is Low</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Ullner, Alona Zharova, Felix Creutzig</p>
            <p>Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches (Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions, early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full electricity system and its decarbonization.</p>

            <h2>Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Fei Teng, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. {The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading via Hybrid Secure Computations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Xin Cui, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers' volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.</p>

            <h2>Research on a Two-Layer Demand Response Framework for Electric Vehicle Users and Aggregators Based on LLMs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyi Zhang, Chenggang Cui, Ning Yang, Chuanlin Zhang</p>
            <p>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the importance of demand response in smart grids. This paper proposes a two-layer demand response optimization framework for EV users and aggregators, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to balance electricity supply and demand and optimize energy utilization during EV charging. The upper-layer model, focusing on the aggregator, aims to maximize profits by adjusting retail electricity prices. The lower-layer model targets EV users, using LLMs to simulate charging demands under varying electricity prices and optimize both costs and user comfort. The study employs a multi-threaded LLM decision generator to dynamically analyze user behavior, charging preferences, and psychological factors. The framework utilizes the PSO method to optimize electricity prices, ensuring user needs are met while increasing aggregator profits. Simulation results show that the proposed model improves EV charging efficiency, alleviates peak power loads, and stabilizes smart grid operations.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Joint Radar and Communication in Disaster Scenarios</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmet Burak Ozyurt, Shreesh Mohalik, John S. Thompson</p>
            <p>With the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a necessity for advanced technologies that can provide reliable situational awareness and communication. Conventional systems are often inadequate due to unreliable infrastructure, power grid failures, high investment costs and scalability challenges. This paper explores the potential of ad-hoc mesh joint radar and communication (JRC) networks as a scalable, resilient, energy-efficient solution for disaster management that can operate independently of conventional infrastructure. The proposed JRC network enhances disaster response by integrating target detection (such as identifying vital signs, hazardous leaks, and fires) with communication capabilities to ensure efficient information dissemination under intense clutter conditions. Key performance metrics, including data rate, Signal-to-Clutter and Noise Ratio (SCNR), probability of detection, and false alarm rate, are used to assess performance. An optimization approach is proposed to provide an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The results show the performance of ad-hoc mesh JRC systems, underscoring their potential to enhance disaster management efforts by addressing unique operational challenges.</p>

            <h2>Quasi Steady-State Frequency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Gutierrez-Florensa, Alvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a UAV serves as an aerial base station (BS) to simultaneously perform communication with a user and detect a target on the ground, while a dual-functional eavesdropper attempts to intercept the signals for both sensing and communication. Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p>

            <h2>Load Forecasting in the Era of Smart Grids: Opportunities and Advanced Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurausp Maneshni</p>
            <p>Electric energy is difficult to store, requiring stricter control over its generation, transmission, and distribution. A persistent challenge in power systems is maintaining real-time equilibrium between electricity demand and supply. Oversupply contributes to resource wastage, while undersupply can strain the grid, increase operational costs, and potentially impact service reliability. To maintain grid stability, load forecasting is needed. Accurate load forecasting balances generation and demand by striving to predict future electricity consumption. This thesis examines and evaluates four machine learning frameworks for short term load forecasting, including gradient boosting decision tree methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). A hybrid framework is also developed. In addition, two recurrent neural network architectures, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are designed and implemented. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to assess the relationships between electricity demand and exogenous variables. The experimental results show that, for the specific dataset and forecasting task in this study, machine learning-based models achieved improved forecasting performance compared to a classical ARIMA baseline.</p>

This paper introduces an unique adaptive multi-objective optimization approach that employs weighted optimization techniques for real-time microgrid systems. The aim is to effectively balance various factors including fuel consumption, load mismatch, power quality, battery degradation, and the utilization of renewable energy sources. A real time experimental data from power hardware in loop system has been used for dynamically updating system states. The adaptive preference-based selection method are adjusted based on state of battery charging thresholds. The technique has been integrated with six technical objectives and complex constraints. This approach helps to practical microgrid decision making and optimization of dynamic energy systems. The energy management process were also able to maximize photovoltaic production where minimizing power mismatch, stabilizing battery state of charge under different condition. The research results were also compared with the baseline system without optimization techniques, and a reliable outcome was found.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiarong Fan, Chenghao Huang, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario, where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jochen L. Cremer</p>
            <p>The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLM) in chats at scale. The LLM-based chat has direct access to a model of the grid and studies the grid's technical constraints just as an expert engineer. The advantage of this system is that end-users can directly interact with grid models through natural language; no intermediate is needed to service, analyse, study, assess, advise, consult and engineer. This initial study paves the way toward developing this tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.</p>

Thanks to the proposed numerical implementation, the method is scalable to Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) models, which can quickly become computationally complex even for small study systems. Case studies show that the nFIM is coherent with parameter variances of single- and multi-parameter least-squares estimators when applied to an IEEE 9-bus dynamic model with artificial measurements.</p>

            <p>With the proliferation of smart grids, smart cities face growing challenges due to cyber-attacks and sophisticated electricity theft behaviors, particularly in residential photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. Traditional Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their effectiveness.

Our hybrid deep learning model, combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy systems in smart cities.</p>

Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation.

While ASVspoof2019 has mismatched conditions only in spoofing attacks in the evaluation set, ASVspoof5 incorporates mismatches in both bona fide and spoofed speech statistics. This paper examines the impact of these mismatches, presenting qualitative and quantitative comparisons within and between the two databases. We show the increased difficulty for genuine and spoofed speech and demonstrate that in ASVspoof5, not only are the attacks more challenging, but the genuine speech also shifts toward spoofed speech compared to ASVspoof2019.</p>

            <p>Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation. We provide 68s video generation results and more examples in our project website: this https URL.</p>

            <p>The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms, have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5% decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fiaz Hossain, Nilanjan Ray Chaudhuri</p>
            <p>A dynamic phasor (DP) framework for time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of grid-forming converters (GFCs) connected to series-compensated transmission lines is proposed. The proposed framework can capture the behavior of GFCs subjected to unbalanced short circuit faults in presence of different current limiting strategies. Moreover, the linearizability and time invariance of this framework allows us to perform eigen decomposition, which is a powerful tool for root-cause analysis and control design. We show that a certain degree of series compensation may result in poorly-damped oscillations in presence of the grid-forming converter. A participation factor analysis using the DP model reveals that the point of interconnection voltage angle is dominant in this mode. Eigenvalue sensitivity analysis of controller parameters shows that reducing the power-frequency droop coefficient is most effective in stabilizing the poorly-damped mode. Detailed validation with electromagnetic transient model demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed framework.</p>

            <h2>Risk-based approach to the Optimal Transmission Switching problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoît Jeanson, Simon H. Tindemans</p>
            <p>This paper deals with the secure Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problem in situations where the TSO is forced to accept the risk that some contingencies may result in the de-energization of parts of the grid to avoid the violation of operational limits. This operational policy, which mainly applies to subtransmission systems, is first discussed. Then, a model of that policy is proposed that complements the classical MILP model of the N-1 secure OTS problem. It comprises a connectivity and notably a partial grid loss analysis for branch outage contingencies. Finally, its application to the IEEE 14-bus system is presented. Solutions similar to those observed in operation are reached by the algorithm, notably revealing the preventive-openings-cascade phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>ExARNN: An Environment-Driven Adaptive RNN for Learning Non-Stationary Power Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Li, Muhao Guo, Yang Weng, Marija Ilic, Guangchun Ruan</p>
            <p>Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.</p>

            <h2>Unsupervised Clustering for Fault Analysis in High-Voltage Power Systems Using Voltage and Current Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Oelhaf, Georg Kordowich, Andreas Maier, Johann Jager, Siming Bayer</p>
            <p>The widespread use of sensors in modern power grids has led to the accumulation of large amounts of voltage and current waveform data, especially during fault events. However, the lack of labeled datasets poses a significant challenge for fault classification and analysis. This paper explores the application of unsupervised clustering techniques for fault diagnosis in high-voltage power systems. A dataset provided by the Reseau de Transport d'Electricite (RTE) is analyzed, with frequency domain features extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The K-Means algorithm is then applied to identify underlying patterns in the data, enabling automated fault categorization without the need for labeled training samples. The resulting clusters are evaluated in collaboration with power system experts to assess their alignment with real-world fault characteristics. The results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised learning for scalable and data-driven fault analysis, providing a robust approach to detecting and classifying power system faults with minimal prior assumptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver (HA), Fujitsu's Digital Annealer V3 (DAv3), and Fujitsu's Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</p>

            <p>The diversity of prosumers' resources in energy communities can provide significant technical and economic benefits to both prosumers and the distribution system operator (DSO). To maximize these benefits, a coordination framework is required to address all techno-economic constraints as well as the objectives of all agents. This paper presents a fully distributed market-clearing scheme to coordinate the strategies of agents within a local energy community. In the proposed framework, prosumers, the DSO, and the local market operator (LMO) are the participating agents. The framework addresses the preferences and techno-economic constraints of all actors while preserving their privacy. The proposed model is based on a modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method with two outer and inner loops; the outer loop models the interactions between the LMO and prosumers, while the inner loop addresses the interactions between the LMO and the DSO. The model is demonstrated on IEEE-69bus test network, showcasing its effectiveness from various perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Scalable and Efficient Aggregation of Energy-Constrained Flexible Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julie Rousseau, Philipp Heer, Kristina Orehounig, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Loads represent a promising flexibility source to support the integration of renewable energy sources, as they may shift their energy consumption over time. By computing the aggregated flexibility of power and energy-constrained loads, aggregators can communicate the group's flexibility without sharing individual private information. However, this computation is, in practice, challenging. Some studies suggest different inner approximations of aggregated flexibility polytopes, but all suffer from large computational costs for realistic load numbers and horizon lengths. In this paper, we develop a novel approximation of the aggregated flexibility of loads based on the concept of worst-case energy dispatch, i.e., if aggregated energy consumptions are assumed to be dispatched in the worst manner possible. This leads to conservative piecewise linear bounds that restrict the aggregated energy consumption only based on the previous aggregated energy consumed. A comparative case study reveals that our method can compute an approximation of the aggregation of thousands of loads efficiently, while displaying an accuracy comparable to other approximation techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julie Rousseau, Carlo Tajoli, Hanmin Cai, Philipp Heer, Kristina Orehounig, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8°C higher and 3.4°C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p>

            <h2>Data Center Model for Transient Stability Analysis of Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Jimenez-Ruiz, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>The rising demand of computing power leads to the installation of a large number of Data Centers (DCs). Their Fault-Ride-Through (FRT) behavior and their unique power characteristics, especially for DCs catered to Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, pose a threat to the stability of power systems. To ensure its stability, it is required accurate models of the loads involved. Here we propose a dynamic load model that properly captures the behaviour of DCs. Its three most defining features are the use of an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) which sits between the server load and the grid, the cooling load represented by an induction motor, and a pulsing load that represents the transients caused by contemporary DCs with significant AI workloads. The features of the proposed model and its impact on the dynamic performance of transmission systems are illustrated through a model of the all-island Irish transmission system and real-world data of the DCs currently connected to this system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Maleki, E. Veronica Belmaga, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana</p>
            <p>The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</p>

            <h2>A Risk-Based Probabilistic Transient Stability Approach for Ranking of Circuit Breakers in a Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umair Shahzad</p>
            <p>Power systems are getting more complex than ever and are consequently operating close to their limit of stability. Moreover, with the increasing demand of renewable wind generation, and the requirement to maintain a secure power system, the importance of transient stability cannot be overestimated. Current deterministic industry practices of transient stability assessment ignore the probability of variables involved. With increasing system uncertainties and widespread electricity market deregulation, there is a strong inevitability to incorporate probabilistic transient stability analysis. Circuit breakers play a critical role in fault clearing and consequently in determining the system transient stability. It is important that they undergo timely and appropriate maintenance procedures based on some criterion. Considering the need of incorporating risk in modern power systems, this paper proposes a risk-based probabilistic transient stability approach for ranking of circuit breakers in a power system. A novel priority index was proposed to rank the circuit breakers based on the system transient stability risk. DIgSILENT PowerFactory software was used to conduct the required simulations on IEEE 14 bus system. The proposed risk-based framework was deemed to be efficient in identification of the circuit breakers based on their priority rank index which can aid in power system planning process.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Wind Generation on Risk-based Security Assessment of Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umair Shahzad</p>
            <p>The electric power system is one of the largest and most intricate infrastructures. Therefore, it is critical to assess and maintain its security. A power system security assessment is indispensable for identifying post-contingency issues, taking corrective measures, and protecting the system from blackouts. This paper examined the impact of wind generation on the risk-based security assessment of a power transmission network in the context of planning. DIgSILENT PowerFactory software was used to conduct the analysis using a combination of the brute force technique and the nonsequential Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method on the IEEE 39-bus transmission test system. Optimal power flow (OPF) was used to quantify security, considering (N-1), (N-2), and (N-3) line outages and an (N-1) bus outage. Moreover, the average cost deviation from the mean optimal system operating cost was proposed as a novel security indicator. The results obtianed accurately depicted the effects of changing wind generation levels on system security in terms of risk. The most and least critical line(s) and bus in the system, for different wind generation levels, were also determined. Moreover, the worst-case wind-generation threshold level using two different cost functions for wind was identified.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection</h2>

            <p>Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection. This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Dong, Zhengsong Lu, Xiaoyu Cao, Zhengwen He, Tanveer Hossain Bhuiyan, Bo Zeng</p>
            <p>This paper presents a distributionally robust planning method for hydrogen-electrical microgrids over islands, where the cross-island energy exchange is supported by a maritime hydrogen transport network. This planning problem is complicated due to heterogeneous off-shore wind-driven uncertainties (i.e., renewable power, transport availability, demand fluctuations, and grid faulting), a subset of which exhibit endogenous uncertainty, as they can be affected by proactive measures (e.g., grid hardening) or infrastructure investment. To capture these features, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed considering decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), which encompasses variation of the underlying distributional ambiguity due to the change of the first stage decisions. Notably, the complete recourse property is missing, which is often neglected in existing DRO studies. Nevertheless, different from the case for land-based microgrids, this issue is critical and fundamental for sea island systems due to their particular physical and logistical requirements. To address these issues, we develop a C&CG algorithm that is customized with strong cutting planes to handle DRO with a varying DDU ambiguity set and feasibility requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and resilience of the proposed planning framework, along with the nontrivial improvements of the algorithm in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

Next, the sign pattern of the trajectory Jacobian matrix associated with the voltage subsystem is analyzed and revealed. The analysis indicates that the voltage dynamics of power systems often exhibits the so-called input-output monotonicity property. The theoretical results are then validated through several simulation examples, underscoring their practical implications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Soroush Karimi Madahi, Kenneth Bruninx, Bert Claessens, Chris Develder</p>
            <p>Transmission System Operators (TSOs) rely on balancing energy provided by Balancing Service Providers (BSPs) to maintain the supply-demand balance in real time. Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) can simultaneously deviate from their day-ahead schedules in response to imbalance prices, e.g., by controlling flexible assets such as batteries. According to the European Electricity Balancing Guideline, these imbalance prices should incentivize BRPs performing such implicit or passive balancing to aid the TSO in restoring the energy balance. In this paper, we demonstrate that BRPs are unintentionally offered the opportunity to exploit gaming strategies in European imbalance settlement mechanisms. This is enabled by a disconnect between sub-quarter-hourly dynamics that determine the imbalance prices and the financial settlement on a quarter-hourly basis. We illustrate this behavior in a case study of the imbalance settlement mechanisms in Belgium and the Netherlands. Our results reveal that, in both countries, BRPs can, in theory, exploit the imbalance mechanism by increasing the instantaneous system imbalance during minutes within the quarter-hour that determine the imbalance price while still contributing to restoring the system balance for the rest of the quarter-hour.</p>

            <p>In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach, the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizing Large-Scale Electric Power Grids with Adaptive Inertia</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Fritzsch, Philippe Jacquod</p>
            <p>The stability of AC power grids relies on ancillary services that mitigate frequency fluctuations. The electromechanical inertia of large synchronous generators is currently the only resource to absorb frequency disturbances on sub-second time scales. Replacing standard thermal power plants with inertialess new renewable sources of energy (NRE) therefore jeopardizes grid stability against e.g. sudden power generation losses. To guarantee system stability and compensate the lack of electromechanical inertia in grids with large penetrations of NREs, virtual synchronous generators, that emulate conventional generators, have been proposed. Here, we propose a novel control scheme for virtual synchronous generators, where the provided inertia is large at short times -- thereby absorbing faults as efficiently as conventional generators -- but decreases over a tunable time scale to prevent coherent frequency oscillations from setting in. We evaluate the performance of this adaptive inertia scheme under sudden power losses in large-scale transmission grids. We find that it systematically outperforms conventional, electromechanical inertia and that it is more stable than previously suggested schemes. Numerical simulations show how a quasi-optimal geographical distribution of adaptive inertia devices not only absorbs local faults efficiently, but also significantly increases the damping of inter-area oscillations. Our results show that the proposed adaptive inertia control scheme is an excellent solution to strengthen grid stability in future low-inertia power grids with large penetrations of NREs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You</p>
            <p>The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balwin Bokor, Klaus Altendorfer, Andrea Matta</p>
            <p>In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing, this study introduces a Simulation-Based Approach (SBA) to model a stopping policy for energy-intensive stochastic production systems, developed and tested in a real-world industrial context. The case company - an energy-intensive lead-acid battery manufacturer - faces significant process uncertainty in its heat-treatment operations, making static planning inefficient. To evaluate a potential sensor-based solution, the SBA leverages simulated sensor data (using a Markovian model) to iteratively refine Bayesian energy estimates and dynamically adjust batch-specific processing times. A full-factorial numerical simulation, mirroring the company's 2024 heat-treatment process, evaluates the SBA's energy reduction potential, configuration robustness, and sensitivity to process uncertainty and sensor distortion. Results are benchmarked against three planning scenarios: (1) Optimized Planned Processing Times (OPT); (2) the company's Current Baseline Practice; and (3) an Ideal Scenario with perfectly known energy requirements. SBA significantly outperforms OPT across all tested environments and in some cases even performs statistically equivalent to an Ideal Scenario. Compared to the Current Baseline Practice, energy input is reduced by 14-25%, depending on uncertainty and sensor accuracy. A Pareto analysis further highlights SBA's ability to balance energy and inspection-labour costs, offering actionable insights for industrial decision-makers.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Power Fluctuations on Frequency Quality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angel Vaca, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes how power injections affect frequency quality in power systems. We first derive a general expression linking active and reactive power injections at buses to the system's frequency. This formulation explicitly considers both real and imaginary frequency components, providing a complete description of frequency behavior in power systems during transients. Next, we extend our analysis to incorporate stochastic variations of power injections. Using the frequency divider concept and power-based frequency estimation, we develop analytical relationships linking stochastic load fluctuations to frequency deviations. We discuss under which conditions the Central Limit Theorem cannot be applied to capture the frequency distribution, thereby clarifying how its hypotheses are not satisfied in power system applications. Then, we establish clear criteria for the appropriate use of statistical methods in frequency analysis. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through simulations on modified IEEE 14-bus and all-island Irish transmission test systems, highlighting the accuracy, practical utility, and limitations of our proposed formulation.</p>

            <h2>Low-regret Strategies for Energy Systems Planning in a Highly Uncertain Future</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Wiest, Niklas Nolzen, Florian Baader, André Bardow, Stefano Moret</p>
            <p>Large uncertainties in the energy transition urge decision-makers to develop low-regret strategies, i.e., strategies that perform well regardless of how the future unfolds. To address this challenge, we introduce a decision-support framework that identifies low-regret strategies in energy system planning under uncertainty. Our framework (i) automatically identifies strategies, (ii) evaluates their performance in terms of regret, (iii) assesses the key drivers of regret, and (iv) supports the decision process with intuitive decision trees, regret curves and decision maps. We apply the framework to evaluate the optimal use of biomass in the transition to net-zero energy systems, considering all major biomass utilization options: biofuels, biomethane, chemicals, hydrogen, biochar, electricity, and heat. Producing fuels and chemicals from biomass performs best across various decision-making criteria. In contrast, the current use of biomass, mainly for low-temperature heat supply, results in high regret, making it a must-avoid in the energy transition.</p>

            <h2>Multi-modal MRI Translation via Evidential Regression and Distribution Calibration</h2>

            <p>Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation leverages information from source MRI sequences to generate target modalities, enabling comprehensive diagnosis while overcoming the limitations of acquiring all sequences. While existing deep-learning-based multi-modal MRI translation methods have shown promising potential, they still face two key challenges: 1) lack of reliable uncertainty quantification for synthesized images, and 2) limited robustness when deployed across different medical centers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that reformulates multi-modal MRI translation as a multi-modal evidential regression problem with distribution calibration. Our approach incorporates two key components: 1) an evidential regression module that estimates uncertainties from different source modalities and an explicit distribution mixture strategy for transparent multi-modal fusion, and 2) a distribution calibration mechanism that adapts to source-target mapping shifts to ensure consistent performance across different medical centers. Extensive experiments on three datasets from the BraTS2023 challenge demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance and robustness across domains.</p>

            <h2>Electrifying Heavy-Duty Trucks: Battery-Swapping vs Fast Charging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruiting Wang, Antoine Martinez, Zaid Allybokus, Wente Zeng, Nicolas Obrecht, Scott Moura</p>
            <p>The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify their optimal design. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.</p>

            <h2>A Virtual Admittance-Based Fault Current Limiting Method for Grid-Forming Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zaid Ibn Mahmood, Hantao Cui, Ying Zhang</p>
            <p>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are a key component in the ongoing modernization of power systems, with grid-forming (GFM) inverters playing a central role. Effective fault current limiting is a major challenge to modernizing power systems through increased penetration of GFM inverters. Due to their voltage-source nature, GFM inverters offer no direct control over the output current and, therefore, are susceptible to high fault currents. This vulnerability is especially pronounced during large phase jumps, a condition overlooked by most fault current limiting methods. This paper proposes a hybrid fault current limiting method implemented through a virtual admittance by leveraging the advantages of two virtual impedance (VI)-based methods tailored for three-phase faults and phase jump disturbances. Electromagnetic transient simulations conducted in MATLAB-Simulink demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various disturbances, validating its potential in single-loop GFM structures.</p>

            <p>We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation, controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging strategies under realistic scenarios.</p>

            <h2>IISE PG&E Energy Analytics Challenge 2025: Hourly-Binned Regression Models Beat Transformers in Load Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Millend Roy, Vladimir Pyltsov, Yinbo Hu</p>
            <p>Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability, resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon. Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge. We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models to generate yearly forecasts. Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.</p>

            <h2>Linear Model of Aggregated Homogeneous Energy Storage Elements with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mazen Elsaadany, Mads R. Almassalkhi, Simon H. Tindemans</p>
            <p>To optimize the dispatch of batteries, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory for a chosen open-loop power schedule to ensure admissibility (i.e., that schedule can be realized). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we develop a novel composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while guaranteeing admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and its disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Xia, Yihong Zhou, Iacopo Savelli, Thomas Morstyn</p>
            <p>In transmission expansion planning (TEP), network planners make long-term investment decisions while anticipating market clearing outcomes that are increasingly affected by renewable generation uncertainty. Additionally, market participants' sensitivity to network charges and the requirement for cost recovery by the network planner introduce further complexity. Since the day-ahead market clears before uncertainty realizes, explicitly modelling these uncertainties at the lower-level market clearing becomes important in bilevel TEP problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel bilevel TEP framework with lower-level joint chance-constrained market clearing that manages line flow constraints under wind uncertainty and accounts for the effect of network tariffs on participants' actual marginal costs and utility. To solve this complex problem, we propose a Strengthened Linear Approximation (SLA) technique for handling Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints with right-hand-side uncertainties (RHS-WDRJCC). The proposed method offers more efficient approximations without additional conservativeness and avoids the numerical issues encountered in existing approaches by introducing valid inequalities. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the desired out-of-sample constraint satisfaction probability. Moreover, the numerical results highlight the significant computational advantage of SLA, achieving up to a 26x speedup compared to existing methods such as worst-case conditional value-at-risk, while maintaining high solution quality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Tao, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You</p>
            <p>Optimization of user association in a densely deployed cellular network is usually challenging and even more complicated due to the dynamic nature of user mobility and fluctuation in user counts. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. Also, existing DRL-based user association methods are typically applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a large vision model (LVM)-enhanced digital twin (DT) for wireless networks and propose a parallel DT-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. To construct this LVM-enhanced DT for DRL training, we develop a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on the diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. DRL models undergo training in the DT environment, avoiding direct interactions with physical networks. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve training efficiency. Numerical results show that the developed LVM-enhanced DT achieves closely comparable training efficacy to the real environment, and the proposed parallel DT framework even outperforms the single real-world environment in DRL training with nearly 20\% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</p>

            <p>Intelligent metasurfaces have demonstrated great promise in revolutionizing wireless communications. One notable example is the two-dimensional (2D) programmable metasurface, which is also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate the wireless propagation environment to enhance network coverage. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have been developed to substantially improve signal processing efficiency by directly processing analog electromagnetic signals in the wave domain. Another exciting breakthrough is the flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which possesses the ability to morph its 3D surface shape in response to dynamic wireless channels and thus achieve diversity gain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging intelligent metasurface technologies. We commence by examining recent experiments of RIS and exploring its applications from four perspectives. Furthermore, we delve into the fundamental principles underlying SIM, discussing relevant prototypes as well as their applications. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the potential of SIM for analog signal processing. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art of FIM technology, discussing its impact on wireless communications and identifying the key challenges of integrating FIMs into wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narges Ehsani, Vishwanath Saragadam, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad</p>
            <p>There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of accuracy (<1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.</p>

            <p>While electric vehicles (EVs) often exhibit substantial flexibility, harnessing this flexibility requires precise characterization of its timing and magnitude. This paper introduces the reduction potential matrix, a novel approach to EV load flexibility modeling which is both straightforward to calculate and intuitive to interpret. This paper demonstrates the approach by quantifying flexibility for two distinct commercial vehicle groups--freight vehicles and transit buses--using simulated charging data from Virginia. While both groups are found to have substantial flexibility, its properties vary across the groups. Naturally, this variability manifests in differences in each group's role as a grid resource. The paper concludes with a discussion on how system planners, fleet operators, and other stakeholders can use the matrix to assess and leverage EV flexibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Muhammad Nadeem, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>Improving the controllability of power networks is crucial as they are highly complex networks operating in synchrony; even minor perturbations can cause desynchronization and instability. To that end, one needs to assess the criticality of key network components (buses and lines) in terms of their impact on system performance. Traditional methods to identify the key nodes/edges in power networks often rely on static centrality measures based on the network's topological structure ignoring the network's dynamic behavior. In this paper, using multi-machine power network models and a new control-theoretic edge centrality matrix (ECM) approach, we: (i) quantify the influence of edges (i.e., the line susceptances) in terms of controllability performance metrics, (ii) identify the most influential lines, and (iii) compute near-optimal edge modifications that improve the power network controllability. Employing various IEEE power network benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of the ECM-based algorithm and demonstrate improvements in system reachability, control, and damping performance.</p>

            <p>In this work, we aim to effectively characterize the performance of cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and to reveal how performance metrics relate to network parameters. To this end, we introduce a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment. Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on communication coverage probability and radar information rate. The analytical expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs) significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system in cooperative ISAC networks.</p>

            <p>Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</p>

Here, we propose a sub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We illuminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back surface of a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited carriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a single-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively reconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625% under a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To further suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular spectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during propagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object, enabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\lambda}0/7 ({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.</p>

            <h2>Fault Detection Method for Power Conversion Circuits Using Thermal Image and Convolutional Autoencoder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noboru Katayama, Rintaro Ishida</p>
            <p>A fault detection method for power conversion circuits using thermal images and a convolutional autoencoder is presented. The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions. The influence of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers and image augmentation conditions on anomaly detection accuracy was also investigated.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion-assisted Model Predictive Control Optimization for Power System Real-Time Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper presents a modified model predictive control (MPC) framework for real-time power system operation. The framework incorporates a diffusion model tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy, and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation with solar and wind.</p>

            <p>Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in achieving specific technical and economic objectives.

            <p>In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Pinching-Antenna Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixuan Li, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding</p>
            <p>This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable performance gain compared to conventional system.</p>

            <p>Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment, contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on recurrent neural networks (RNN), whose computational complexity hinders system efficiency. This paper introduces DeltaDPD, exploring the dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and neuronal hidden states in RNNs for energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW 256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03 dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power.

            <h2>A Novel Inverter Control Strategy with Power Decoupling for Microgrid Operations in Grid-Connected and Islanded Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Tong, Qin Wang, Aihong Tang</p>
            <p>Grid-forming, particularly those utilizing droop control and virtual synchronous generators (VSG), can actively regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrid systems, exhibiting dynamic characteristics akin to those of synchronous generators. Although droop control and VSG control each have distinct benefits, neither can fully meet the diverse, dynamic needs of both grid-connected (GC) and islanded (IS) modes. Additionally, the coupling between active and reactive power can negatively impact microgrids' dynamic performance and stability. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a unified dynamic power coupling (UDC) model. This model's active power control loop can be tailored to meet diverse requirements. By implementing a well-designed control loop, the system can harness the advantages of both droop control and VSG control. In islanded mode, the proposed model can provide virtual inertia and damping properties, while in grid-connected mode, the inverter's active power output can follow the changed references without significant overshoot or oscillation. Furthermore, the model incorporates coupling compensation and virtual impedance based on a relative gain array in the frequency domain to facilitate quantitative analysis of power coupling characteristics. This paper outlines a distinct design process for the unified model. Finally, the proposed control method has been validated through simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Rezaeizadeh, Silvia Mastellone</p>
            <p>Power electronics converters are key enablers in the global energy transition for power generation, industrial and mobility applications; they convert electrical power in a controlled, reliable and efficient manner. The semiconductor switching devices, at the core of power converters, are the most likely component to fail due to the damage caused by the current-induced temperature cycling. Damage models of semiconductors have been developed and employed to study their reliability, improve their design and to estimate the lifetime of the converter in various power applications. However, those models can offer more if employed in the design of strategies to actively operate the converter. Specifically, properly controlling the current, and hence the temperature cycling, can effectively contribute to reducing the accumulated damage in the semiconductor and increase its reliability and lifetime. In this paper we propose a novel current control approach that integrates reliability requirements into the design framework, based on a frequency-domain model of the semiconductor damage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong-Peng Liu, Wei Sun, Dali Zhou, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>Integrated electricity and gas systems are constructed to facilitate the gas-fired generation, and the distributed operation of these integrated systems have received much attention due to the increased emphasis on data security and privacy between different agencies. This paper proposes an extended convex hull based method to address optimal energy flow problems for the integrated electricity and gas systems in a distributed manner. First, a multi-block electricity-gas system model is constructed by dividing the whole system into N blocks considering both physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with the extended convex hullbased constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution for the convexified model is checked, and a sufficient condition is developed. If the sufficient condition is satisfied, the optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem can be recovered from that for the convexified problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is tractable and effective in obtaining feasible optimal solutions for multi-block optimal energy flow problems.</p>

            <p>The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.</p>

            <p>The large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources presents significant challenges to maintaining power balance and nominal frequency in modern power systems. This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <p>Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this \textcolor{black}{never-before} used spectrum by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity (e.g. data rate) tradeoffs, while also examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output, compact and digital architectures, and evaluate the potential of multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaan Ul Haque, Sajad Khodadadian, Siva Theja Maguluri</p>
            <p>Stochastic approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm for finding the fixed point of an operator using noisy samples and widely used in optimization and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The noise in RL exhibits a Markovian structure, and in some cases, such as gradient temporal difference (GTD) methods, SA is employed in a two-time-scale framework. This combination introduces significant theoretical challenges for analysis. We derive an upper bound on the error for the iterations of linear two-time-scale SA with Markovian noise. We demonstrate that the mean squared error decreases as $trace (\Sigma^y)/k + o(1/k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterates, and $\Sigma^y$ is an appropriately defined covariance matrix. A key feature of our bounds is that the leading term, $\Sigma^y$, exactly matches with the covariance in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the two-time-scale SA, and we call them tight finite-time bounds. We illustrate their use in RL by establishing sample complexity for off-policy algorithms, TDC, GTD, and GTD2. A special case of linear two-time-scale SA that is extensively studied is linear SA with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. We present tight finite time bounds corresponding to the covariance matrix of the CLT. Such bounds can be used to study TD-learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging.</p>

            <p>Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a new class of permanent magnet-assisted three-phase switched reluctance motors (PM-SRMs) designed to achieve significantly higher torque density for electric vehicle (EV) propulsion systems. Eight distinct motor topologies are systematically investigated, including a non-PM baseline design, three innovative PM arrangement strategies, and two optimized rotor/stator teeth configurations (22-pole and 26-pole variants). The study presents analytical models including magnetic equivalent circuits (MECs), detailed operating principles, and generalized design formulations that account for both electromagnetic and structural considerations. A key contribution is the introduction of the point-of-conversion (PoC) concept, which optimizes PM placement by minimizing magnetic path reluctance. Comparative analysis demonstrates torque density improvements over conventional SRMs and existing PM-assisted designs while maintaining structural robustness. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed 24/22 configuration with inter-phase PMs delivers higher torque per PM volume compared to state-of-the-art designs. The findings provide insights for EV motor designers seeking to balance performance, cost, and reliability.</p>

            <p>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings, offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic and environmental goals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Lu, Zeyin Hou, Wei Gu, Yijun Xu</p>
            <p>The inherent thermal storage capacity of buildings brings considerable thermal flexibility to the heating/cooling loads, which are promising demand response resources for power systems. It is widely believed that integrating the thermal flexibility of buildings into the distribution system can improve the operating economy and reliability of the system. However, the private information of the buildings needs to be transferred to the distribution system operator (DSO) to achieve a coordinated optimization, bringing serious privacy concerns to users. Given this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserved optimal dispatch approach for the distribution system incorporating buildings. Using it, the DSO can exploit the thermal flexibility of buildings without accessing their private information, such as model parameters and indoor temperature profiles. Specifically, we first develop an optimal dispatch model for the distribution system integrating buildings, which can be extended to other storage-like flexibility resources. Second, we reveal that the privacy-preserved integration of buildings is a joint privacy preservation problem for both parameters and state variables and then design a privacy-preserved algorithm based on transformation-based encryption, constraint relaxation, and constraint extension techniques. Besides, we implement a detailed privacy analysis for the proposed method, considering both semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Case studies demonstrate the accuracy, privacy-preserved performance, and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merijn Van Deyck, Geraint Chaffey, Dirk Van Hertem</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a methodology for shortlisting protection system configurations for large HVDC switching stations, which are expected in multiterminal HVDC grids and electrical energy hubs (or energy islands). This novel approach focuses on the configuration of protection equipment and the arrangement of lines and converters in various protection zones, instead of expert decisions on protection strategies based on numerous simulations. A graph-based approach that allows high-level evaluation of possible DC fault impacts is presented. This fault impact evaluation method can evaluate many possible protection configurations allowing the selection of less obvious choices, as experts cannot consider all possible configurations, especially when the switching station size increases. A filtering process is applied to reduce the number of possible configurations based on multiple protection performance metrics which are evaluated for different power flow scenarios. The results for these performance metrics can be compared for configurations with different numbers of HVDC circuit breakers to assess the benefit of increasing the amount of protection equipment in different network topologies. It is also shown that, through continued filtering using additional performance metrics or fault scenarios, the number of possible breaker, cable and converter configurations can be further reduced, leading to a protection design that is well suited for many operational scenarios. The results of the shortlisting process provide insights on the required number of HVDC circuit breakers to limit fault impacts to a given value. Moreover, observed trends in the results could, in future studies, contribute to new design principles and priorities, allowing system developers to more effectively design HVDC protection systems for different operational scenarios and possible investment levels.</p>

            <h2>Learning Power Control Protocol for In-Factory 6G Subnetworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uyoata E. Uyoata, Gilberto Berardinelli, Ramoni Adeogun</p>
            <p>In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios, effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane, often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages. The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.</p>

            <h2>Tuning a Cascaded Online Feedback Optimization Controller for Provision of Distributed Flexibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irina Zettl, Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Florian Schmidtke, Lukas Ortmann, Andreas Ulbig</p>
            <p>Coordinating a high number of flexibility providing units (e.g. to provide ancillary services for the transmission system) across various grid layers requires new control concepts. A flexibility request at a point of common coupling can be met by utilizing a cascaded control structure based on online feedback optimization. In this paper the influence of the parameterization of the individual controllers on the performance of the hierarchical flexibility provision is studied on a three-level test system. The results show a high interdependency between the choice of control parameters of one controller and the behavior of other controllers as well as a significant impact on the accuracy and speed of flexibility provision. With a careful tuning, a cascaded structure based on online feedback optimization can achieve efficient vertical coordination of flexibility providing units.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stavros Orfanoudakis, Nanda Kishor Panda, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p>

            <h2>Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price Balancing Scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Bruninx, Timothy Verstraeten, Jalal Kazempour, Jan Helsen</p>
            <p>We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</p>

            <h2>LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wangkun Xu, Zhongda Chu, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

            <h2>Optimal Microgrid Sizing of Offshore Renewable Energy Sources for Offshore Platforms and Coastal Communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara</p>
            <p>The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards renewable energy and advanced storage solutions, driven by the urgent need for sustainable and resilient power systems. Isolated offshore communities, such as islands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or diesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy integration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines, wave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired with a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper introduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to identify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for offshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting for battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a deep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in variables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge, depth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions demonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while maintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design solution for offshore microgrid systems.</p>

            <h2>Predictive Control of EV Overnight Charging with Multi-Session Flexibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Wieberneit, Emanuele Crisostomi, Anthony Quinn, Robert Shorten</p>
            <p>The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight, where the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus representing a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control algorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require full charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of surplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of controlled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug, scheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over prediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising model predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK National Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions with multi-session planning of 40 to 46\% compared to uncontrolled charging and 19 to 26\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the driving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility and consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid carbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant variations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Maraqa, Sylvester Aboagye, Majid H. Khoshafa, Telex M. N. Ngatched</p>
            <p>Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution. Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE performances are provided.</p>

            <h2>Learning Economic Model Predictive Control via Clustering and Kernel-Based Lipschitz Regression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiliang Xiong, Defeng He, Haiping Du</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel learning economic model predictive control scheme for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to input and state constraints and unknown dynamics. We design a fast and accurate Lipschitz regression method using input and output data that combines clustering and kernel regression to learn the unknown dynamics. In each cluster, the parallel convex optimization problems are solved to estimate the kernel weights and reduce the Lipschitz constant of the predictor, hence limiting the error propagation in the prediction horizon. We derive the two different bounds of learning errors in deterministic and probabilistic forms and customize a new robust constraint-tightening strategy for the discontinuous predictor. Then, the learning economic model predictive control algorithm is formulated by introducing a stabilized optimization problem to construct a Lyapunov function. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations of a numerical example and a continuously stirred tank reactor.</p>

Effective fault detection and mitigation become vital as reliance on such electronics grows. This paper explores three generative machine learning-based approaches for fault detection in medical devices, leveraging sensor data from surgical staplers,a class 2 medical device. Historically considered low-risk, these devices have recently been linked to an increasing number of injuries and fatalities.

            <p>Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover. The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud cover of 87.5%</p>

            <h2>Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yushan Li, Jianping He, Dimos V. Dimarogonas</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahman Saadat Yeganeh, Hamid Behroozi</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an advanced non-terrestrial communication architecture that integrates Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) with a Beyond-Diagonal Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-ARIS) mounted on a UAV under the coverage of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The BD-ARIS adopts a group-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability, while RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common and private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV positioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and high-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of both the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that TRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate, especially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3 converges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C suffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness of each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is evaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the proposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional RIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G and massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Protective Relays: A Perspective for Current Limiting Control Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Li, Heng Wu, Xiongfei Wang</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters can significantly alter the fault characteristics of power systems, which challenges the proper function of protective relays. This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction between GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in protective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is revealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current reference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising elements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting highly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of such elements. This finding provides insights into the design of CLC for GFM IBRs from a protection perspective. It is further found that even with a highly inductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced by the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based supervising elements. These theoretical findings are corroborated by simulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Yao, Xuhang Liu, Anna Scaglione, Shlomo Bekhor, Kenan Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the complex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power delivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified logistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to maximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric delivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the locational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and charging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov decision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to achieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other hand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal e-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the integrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild assumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's fixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this paper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve sustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power systems.</p>

            <p>To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</p>

We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</p>

            <p>Real-time tracking of inertia is important because it reflects the power system's ability to withstand contingencies and maintain frequency security. This paper proposes a practical approach to estimate inertia using ambient phasor measurement unit (PMU) data and a partitioned form of the swing equation. The approach accounts for (bounded) uncertainties in network parameters and PMU measurements, enabling precise estimation of inertia and damping constants, as well as mechanical power inputs. Instead of assuming constant mechanical power input throughout, the approach leverages knowledge of power system operations to determine intervals when it is actually constant to maintain estimation consistency. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 39 bus system integrated with renewable energy sources affirm the method's accuracy and applicability.</p>

            <h2>Power Loss and Temperature Distribution in Coil of PFC Inductor with Air Gap for Multimode Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafal Kasikowski</p>
            <p>Power converters inherently display non-linear load characteristics, resulting in a high level of mains harmonics, and hence the necessity of implementing Power Factor Correction (PFC). Active PFC circuitry typically comprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current so that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of the waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC inductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and investigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a combination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC inductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion and, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This paper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct power-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency eddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As demonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level, exhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to the somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing magnetic flux at an air gap. The latter assertion will undergo further, more quantitatively focused research. Finally, the construction of the coil was optimised to reduce power loss by diminishing eddy-current mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongjin Du, Tuanku Badzlin Hashfi, Rashmi Prasad, Pedro P. Vergara, Peter Palensky, Aleksandra Lekić</p>
            <p>With the growing integration of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems, there is an increasing need for control strategies that ensure both economic efficiency and robust dynamic performance. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework for hybrid AC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel droop control strategy that coordinates DC voltage and AC frequency regulation. By embedding frequency control loops into the MMCs, the method enables system-wide coordination, enhancing power sharing and improving system resilience under disturbances. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts converter operating points to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations, thus balancing economic objectives with system stability. A modified Nordic test system integrated with a four-terminal MTDC grid is used to validate the approach. Optimization is performed using Julia, while the system's dynamic performance is evaluated through electromagnetic transient simulations with the EMTP software. Case studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower generation costs than active power control and adaptive droop control strategy while maintaining stable control characteristics. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver cost-effective operation without compromising performance, offering a promising solution for the coordinated control of future hybrid AC-DC transmission networks.</p>

            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion.

Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probabilistic ability to offer different flexibility products, namely, redispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed for different categories of charging stations (CS) and dispatch strategies. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. Further, it is shown how machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the day-ahead consumption, followed by operationally predicting redispatch flexibility. The findings demonstrate that the timing of EV arrivals, departures, and connections plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of product offerings, and dependable services can generally be delivered using a sufficiently large number of CSs.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation Using LinDistFlow Model with Loss Compensation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanlin Jiang, Xinliang Dai, Frederik Zahn, Veit Hagenmeyer</p>
            <p>With the increasing integration of renewable energy resources and the growing need for data privacy between system operators, flexibility aggregation methods have emerged as a promising solution to coordinate integrated transmissiondistribution (ITD) systems with limited information exchange. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to the nonlinearity of AC power flow models, and therefore mostly rely on linearized models. This paper examines the inherent errors in the LinDistFlow model, a linearized approximation, and demonstrates their impact on flexibility aggregation. To address these issues, we propose an intuitive compensation approach to refine the LinDistFlow-based flexibility set. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in efficiently coordinating ITD systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Frequency Control of LCC-S Resonant Converters for Wireless Power Transfer Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza Safari, Mohsen Hamzeh, Nima Mahdian Dehkordi</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control strategy for achieving precise and robust output voltage regulation in LCC-S resonant converters, specifically designed for wireless power transfer applications. Unlike conventional methods that rely on manually tuned PI controllers or heuristic tuning approaches, our method leverages the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to systematically optimize PI controller parameters. The complex converter dynamics are captured using the Direct Piecewise Affine (DPWA) modeling technique, providing a structured approach to handling its nonlinearities. This integration not only eliminates the need for manual tuning, but also enhances control adaptability under varying operating conditions. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed DRL-based tuning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability, robustness, and response time. This work demonstrates the potential of DRL in power electronic control, offering a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional controller design approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Walter Zibusiso Ncube, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani</p>
            <p>Driven by the exponential growth in data traffic and the limitations of Radio Frequency (RF) networks, Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for high data rate communication. However, the inherently dynamic nature of OWC environments resulting from user mobility, and time-varying user demands poses significant challenges for enhanced and sustainable performance. Energy efficiency (EE) is a critical metric for the sustainable operation of next generation wireless networks. Achieving high EE in dynamic OWC environments, especially under time-varying user distributions and heterogeneous service requirements, remains a complex task. In this work, we formulate a discrete-time EE optimisation problem in a dynamic OWC to maximise energy efficiency through determining user connectivity and power allocation. Solving this problem in real time is computationally demanding due to the coupling of user association and power allocation variables over discrete time slots. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Prediction and Optimised Power Allocation (PDP-OPA) framework which predicts user arrivals, departures, and traffic demands. Based on these predictions, the framework proactively determines AP-user associations and allocates power dynamically using a Lagrangian-based optimisation strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDP-OPA significantly enhances system performance, providing solutions close to the optimal ones. The proposed framework improves energy efficiency, sum rate, and bit error rate (BER) compared to distance-based user association and uniform power allocation, validating its effectiveness for real time and adaptive resource management in dynamic OWC systems.</p>

            <h2>Energy Efficiency Maximization for CR-NOMA based Smart Grid Communication Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mubashar Sarfraz, Sheraz Alam, Sajjad A. Ghauri, Asad Mahmood</p>
            <p>Managing massive data flows effectively and resolving spectrum shortages are two challenges that Smart Grid Communication Networks (SGCN) must overcome. To address these problems, we provide a combined optimization approach that makes use of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technologies. Our work focuses on using user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) techniques to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in SGCN, particularly within Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs). We develop a joint optimization problem that takes into account the real-world limitations of a CR-NOMA setting. This problem is NP-hard, nonlinear, and nonconvex by nature. To address the computational complexity of the problem, we use the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, which breaks the problem into UP and PA subproblems. Initially, we proposed the Zebra-Optimization User Pairing (ZOUP) algorithm to tackle the UP problem, which outperforms both Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and non-optimized NOMA (UPWO) by 78.8\% and 13.6\%, respectively, at a SNR of 15 dB. Based on the ZOUP pairs, we subsequently proposed the PA approach, i.e., ZOUPPA, which significantly outperforms UPWO and ZOUP by 53.2\% and 25.4\%, respectively, at an SNR of 15 dB. A detailed analysis of key parameters, including varying SNRs, power allocation constants, path loss exponents, user density, channel availability, and coverage radius, underscores the superiority of our approach. By facilitating the effective use of communication resources in SGCN, our research opens the door to more intelligent and energy-efficient grid systems. Our work tackles important issues in SGCN and lays the groundwork for future developments in smart grid communication technologies by combining modern optimization approaches with CR-NOMA.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitris Kallis, Moysis Symeonides, Marios D. Dikaiakos</p>
            <p>The widespread adoption of IoT has driven the development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in industrial environments, leveraging Industrial IoTs (IIoTs) to automate manufacturing processes and enhance productivity. The transition to autonomous systems introduces significant operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. Accurate modeling and prediction of IIoT energy requirements are critical, but traditional physics- and engineering-based approaches often fall short in addressing these challenges comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for benchmarking and analyzing IIoT devices and applications to uncover insights into their power demands, energy consumption, and performance. To demonstrate this methodology, we develop a comprehensive framework and apply it to study an industrial CPS comprising an educational robotic arm, a conveyor belt, a smart camera, and a compute node. By creating micro-benchmarks and an end-to-end application within this framework, we create an extensive performance and power consumption dataset, which we use to train and analyze ML models for predicting energy usage from features of the application and the CPS system. The proposed methodology and framework provide valuable insights into the energy dynamics of industrial CPS, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of IIoT-driven automation.</p>

            <p>Second language proficiency (L2) in English is usually perceptually evaluated by English teachers or expert evaluators, with the inherent intra- and inter-rater variability. This paper explores deep learning techniques for comprehensive L2 proficiency assessment, addressing both the speech signal and its correspondent transcription.

Additionally, we examine text-based proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust automated L2 proficiency evaluation.</p>

            <p>This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</p>

            <h2>Defense Strategies for Autonomous Multi-agent Systems: Ensuring Safety and Resilience Under Exponentially Unbounded FDI Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichao Wang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Dimitra Panagou, Shan Zuo</p>
            <p>False data injection attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). Existing attack-resilient control strategies generally have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and solving the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, an attack-resilient compensational signal is designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Finally, a SAAR controller is designed by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem integrating control barrier function (CBF) certified collision-free safety constraints. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for heterogeneous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Schynol, Marius Pesavento</p>
            <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</p>

            <h2>Towards Probabilistic Dynamic Security Assessment and Enhancement of Large Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Sabot, Pierre-Etienne Labeau, Pierre Henneaux</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel methodology for probabilistic dynamic security assessment and enhancement of power systems that considers load and generation variability, N-2 contingencies, and uncertain cascade propagation caused by uncertain protection system behaviour. In this methodology, a database of likely operating conditions is generated via weather data, a market model and a model of operators' preventive actions. System states are sampled from this database and contingencies are applied to them to perform the security assessment. Rigorous statistical indicators are proposed to decide how many biased and unbiased samples to simulate to reach a target accuracy on the statistical error on the estimated risk from individual contingencies. Optionally, a screening of contingencies can be performed to limit the computational burden of the analysis. Finally, interpretable machine learning techniques are used to identify the root causes of the risk from critical contingencies, to ease the interpretation of the results, and to help with security enhancement. The method is demonstrated on the 73-bus reliability test system, and the scalability to large power systems (with thousands of buses) is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>One Target, Many Views: Multi-User Fusion for Collaborative Uplink ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>We propose a novel pilot-free multi-user uplink framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mm-wave networks, where single-antenna users transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals without dedicated pilots. The base station exploits the spatial and velocity diversities of users to simultaneously decode messages and detect targets, transforming user transmissions into a powerful sensing tool. Each user's signal, structured by a known codebook, propagates through a sparse multi-path channel with shared moving targets and user-specific scatterers. Notably, common targets induce distinct delay-Doppler-angle signatures, while stationary scatterers cluster in parameter space. We formulate the joint multi-path parameter estimation and data decoding as a 3D super-resolution problem, extracting delays, Doppler shifts, and angles-of-arrival via atomic norm minimization, efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. A core innovation is multiuser fusion, where diverse user observations are collaboratively combined to enhance sensing and decoding. This approach improves robustness and integrates multi-user perspectives into a unified estimation framework, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable communication. Numerical results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances both target estimation and communication performance, highlighting its potential for next-generation ISAC systems.</p>

            <p>This work introduces the category of Power System Transition Planning optimization problem. It aims to shift power systems to emissions-free networks efficiently. Unlike comparable work, the framework presented here broadly applies to the industry's decision-making process. It defines a field-appropriate functional boundary focused on the economic efficiency of power systems. Namely, while imposing a wide range of planning factors in the decision space, the model maintains the structure and depth of conventional power system planning under uncertainty, which leads to a large-scale multistage stochastic programming formulation that encounters intractability in real-life cases. Thus, the framework simultaneously invokes high-performance computing defaultism. In this comprehensive exposition, we present a guideline model, comparing its scope to existing formulations, supported by a fully detailed example problem, showcasing the analytical value of the solution gained in a small test case. Then, the framework's viability for realistic applications is demonstrated by solving an extensive test case based on a realistic planning construct consistent with Alberta's power system practices for long-term planning studies. The framework resorts to Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming as a decomposition method to achieve tractability, leveraging High-Performance Computing and parallel computation.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and communication networks has brought both modernization and new vulnerabilities to the power system infrastructure. These vulnerabilities expose the system to internal faults and cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, which can closely mimic real fault scenarios. Hence, this work presents a two-stage fault and cyberattack detection framework tailored for inverter-based microgrids. Stage 1 introduces an unsupervised learning model Feature Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN), to distinguish between genuine internal faults and cyber-induced anomalies in microgrids. Compared to conventional GAN architectures, F2GAN demonstrates improved system diagnosis and greater adaptability to zero-day attacks through its feature-feedback mechanism. In Stage 2, supervised machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to localize and classify faults within inverter switches, distinguishing between single-switch and multi-switch faults. The proposed framework is validated on a simulated microgrid environment, illustrating robust performance in detecting and classifying both physical and cyber-related disturbances in power electronic-dominated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jöbke Janssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bert Zwart, Jalal Kazempour</p>
            <p>One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</p>

            <p>This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{é}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</p>

            <p>Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan</p>
            <p>Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

            <h2>Linear Phase Balancing Scheme using Voltage Unbalance Sensitivities in Multi-phase Power Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Dimension-reduced Optimization of Multi-zone Thermostatically Controlled Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueyuan Cui, Yi Wang, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>This study proposes a computationally efficient method for optimizing multi-zone thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) by leveraging dimensionality reduction through an auto-encoder. We develop a multi-task learning framework to jointly represent latent variables and formulate a state-space model based on observed TCL operation data. This significantly reduces the dimensionality of TCL variables and states while preserving critical nonlinear interdependencies in TCL control. To address various application scenarios, we introduce optimization algorithms based on system identification (OptIden) and system simulation (OptSim) tailored to the latent variable representation. These approaches employ automatic differentiation and zeroth-order techniques, respectively, for efficient implementation. We evaluate the proposed method using a 90-zone apartment prototype, comparing its performance to traditional high-dimensional optimization. Results demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces control costs while achieving significantly higher computational efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zeng, Ji Wang, Xingwang Li, Gongpu Wang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and addressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For performance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are considered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each user, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna significantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna architectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based scheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based approach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal performance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna configuration.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Lautenbacher, Ali Rajaei, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Jochen L. Cremer</p>
            <p>Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven operator learning for energy-efficient building control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuexin Bian, Yuanyuan Shi</p>
            <p>Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.</p>

            <h2>Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using Gaussian Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Glover, Parikshit Pareek, Deepjyoti Deka, Anamika Dubey</p>
            <p>Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.</p>

            <h2>Three-Stage Composite Outlier Identification of Wind Power Data: Integrating Physical Rules with Regression Learning and Mathematical Morphology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Limengqian Zheng, Lipeng Zhu, Weijia Wen, Jiayong Li, Cong Zhang</p>
            <p>Existing studies on identifying outliers in wind speed-power datasets are often challenged by the complicated and irregular distributions of outliers, especially those being densely stacked yet staying close to normal data. This could degrade their identification reliability and robustness in practice. To address this defect, this paper develops a three-stage composite outlier identification method by systematically integrating three complementary techniques, i.e., physical rule-based preprocessing, regression learning-enabled detection, and mathematical morphology-based refinement. Firstly, the raw wind speed-power data are preprocessed via a set of simple yet efficient physical rules to filter out some outliers obviously going against the physical operating laws of practical wind turbines. Secondly, a robust wind speed-power regression learning model is built upon the random sample consensus algorithm. This model is able to reliably detect most outliers with the help of an adaptive threshold automatically set by the interquartile range method. Thirdly, by representing the wind speed-power data distribution with a two-dimensional image, mathematical morphology operations are applied to perform refined outlier identification from a data distribution perspective. This technique can identify outliers that are not effectively detected in the first two stages, including those densely stacked ones near normal data points. By integrating the above three techniques, the whole method is capable of identifying various types of outliers in a reliable and adaptive manner. Numerical test results with wind power datasets acquired from distinct wind turbines in practice and from simulation environments extensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as well as its potential in enhancing wind power prediction.</p>

            <p>Predicting the time series of future evolutions of renewable injections and demands is of utmost importance for the operation of power systems. However, the current state of the art is mostly focused on mean-value time series predictions and only very few methods provide probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we rely on kernel density estimation and vine copulas to construct probabilistic models for individual load profiles of private households. Our approach allows the quantification of variability of individual energy consumption in general and of daily peak loads in particular. We draw upon an Australian distribution grid dataset to illustrate our findings. We generate synthetic loads that follow the distribution of the real data.</p>

            <h2>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage Considering Strategic Capacity Withholding and Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Pierre Pinson, Mads R. Almassalkhi, Yingrui Zhuang, Yifan Su, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed data-driven distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxi Tang, Li Peng</p>
            <p>What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Costas Mylonas, Emmanouel Varvarigos, Georgios Tsaousoglou</p>
            <p>Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets, decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution network's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL typically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated into the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper ensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide distribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the aspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the decision-making loop.</p>

            <h2>A Decentralized Local Flexibility Market for Local Energy Communities to Mitigate Grid Congestion: A Case Study in Sweden</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Mohiti, Mohammadreza Mazidi, David Steen, Le Anh Tuan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a preventive congestion management framework with joint Local Flexibility Capacity Market (LFCM) and Local Energy Markets (LEMs). The framework enables Local Energy Communities (LECs) to optimize their flexibility potential across the LEM, LFCM, and heat markets. The LECs utilize their heat and electricity resources to offer flexibility services to Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for congestion relief. In this framework, energy and flexibility are treated as separate variables, each subject to different pricing scheme. Flexibility prices are market-driven, dynamically reflecting the location and severity of congestion. A case study conducted at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion by trading the LECs flexibility in the LFCM. The study also highlights up to 40% financial benefits for LECs, promoting the LFCM as a viable solution for congestion management in future decentralized energy systems.</p>

            <p>The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and EU-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. We use an optimisation model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focussing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions, and land use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in Southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall. These results on regional trade-offs facilitate more meaningful policy discussions which are crucial in the transition to a sustainable energy system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beyzanur Aydin, Rebecca Holt, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar photovoltaics (PV), poses a risk to the distribution grid under high penetration. Therefore, studying hosting capacity (HC) limits considering grid physics and demand variability is crucial. This paper introduces an improved framework for determining the HC of radial distribution networks by enhancing an existing convex inner approximation (CIA) approach. The proposed method achieves a more accurate and larger inner approximation, resulting in better HC limits. We also consider time-varying demand and the design of objective functions to ensure equitable access to grid resources. A case study with solar PV integration is conducted using a modified IEEE-37 radial network to examine the impact of increased PV capacity, demonstrating that with no more than 5% annual solar PV energy curtailed, it is possible to increase solar PV hosting capacity by at least 50% with no negative grid impacts and a net positive economic impact when accounted for the cost of carbon. Results show that fair allocation methods can lead to higher net profits and reduced PV curtailment and CO2.</p>

            <p>Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) technology has been considered a promising solution in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to its potential to overcome the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage issue and enhance coverage. Moreover, integrating IRS with a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission technique for multi-users is a smart solution to achieve a high sum rate and improve system performance. In this paper, a dynamic IRS-assisted NOMA-VLC system is modeled, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize sum energy efficiency (SEE) and fairness among multiple mobile users under power allocation and IRS mirror orientation constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the non-linearity of the constraints, conventional optimization methods are impractical for real-time solutions. Therefore, a two-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for optimizing power allocation and IRS orientation based on centralized training with decentralized execution to obtain fast and real-time solutions in dynamic environments. The results show the superior performance of the proposed DRL algorithm compared to standard DRL algorithms typically used for resource allocation in wireless communication. The results also show that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves higher performance compared to deployments without IRS and with randomly oriented IRS elements.</p>

            <p>Incorporating renewable energy sources into modern power grids has significantly decreased system inertia, which has raised concerns about power system vulnerability to disturbances and frequency instability. The conventional methods for evaluating transient stability by bounding frequency deviations are often conservative and may not accurately reflect real-world conditions and operational constraints. To address this, we propose a framework for assessing the resilience of power systems against disturbances while adhering to realistic operational frequency constraints. Our approach leverages the Lure system representation of power system dynamics and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to capture the essential frequency response requirements set by grid operators. This enables us to translate frequency constraints into formal robustness semantics. We then formulate an optimization problem to identify the maximum disturbance that the system can withstand without violating these constraints. The resulting optimization is translated into a scenario optimization while addressing the uncertainty in the obtained solution. The proposed methodology has been simulated on the Single Machine Infinite Bus case study and 9-Bus IEEE benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing resilience across various operating conditions and delivering promising results.</p>

            <p>Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum structures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to significant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we introduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler spiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes of soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural network-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model accurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and payload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed actuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low average positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator length at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively. Furthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads with an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results underscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Allocation for OFDM-based Ranging Using Random Communication Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhang, Fan Liu, Tao Liu, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>High-precision ranging plays a crucial role in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. To improve the ranging performance while maximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to reuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent randomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC system under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of both periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the ISAC signal. Towards that end, we first derive the closed-form expressions of the average squared P-ACF and A-ACF, and then propose to minimize the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under arbitrary constellation mapping. We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme achieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step further, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at every lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with frequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the ranging resolution. We reveal that there exists a tradeoff between sidelobe level and mainlobe width, and propose a project gradient descent algorithm to seek a locally optimal PA scheme that reduces the EISL. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed PA methods in reducing the ranging sidelobe level for random OFDM signals.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Driven Neural Compensation For Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuyu Wang, Huiting Deng, Dong Liu</p>
            <p>Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction, but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT, thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.</p>

            <h2>Physical Layer Security for Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Survey</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshiki Matsumine, Hideki Ochiai, Junji Shikata</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The integration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum and infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The introduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities related to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant research focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security (PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages embedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious sensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance and security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique opportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential eavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS methodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC. The study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS and sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the existing literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for ISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current state of research. The study concludes by outlining potential avenues for future research pertaining to secure ISAC systems.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates an integrated sensing, communication, and computing system deployed over low-altitude networks for enabling applications within the low-altitude economy. In the considered system, a full-duplex enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched in the airspace, functioning as a UAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ULAP). The ULAP is capable of achieving simultaneous information transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge computing services. To reduce the overall energy consumption of the system while meeting the sensing beampattern threshold and user computation requirements, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing the task allocation, computation resource allocation, transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. Since the problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternation optimization, which decomposes the original problem into tractable convex subproblems. Moreover, we analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme saves up to 54.12\% energy consumption performance compared to the benchmark schemes.</p>

Analytical characterizations of the RCHP's operating profit and the optimal sizing of renewable and electrolyzer capacities are obtained. We use real-time renewable production and electricity price data from three independent system operators to assess the impacts of hydrogen market prices, renewable generation, and electricity prices on RCHP's profitability.</p>

            <p>Recent events, including the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and climate change impacts, have exposed the critical need to ensure energy security and resilience in energy systems. We review existing definitions and interrelations between energy security and resilience, conceptualising these terms in the context of energy system transformations.

Examples illustrate their distinct impacts on technical, economic, and environmental system performance over time. We compile relevant recourse options across resilience capacity levels and system planning horizons to address these challenges, emphasising actionable strategies for an increasingly integrated energy system.

            <h2>Voltage Stability and Control of Electrical Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Power Electronic Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dionysios Moutevelis</p>
            <p>Power systems are currently undergoing a rapid paradigm change in their operation. Centralised energy production is being replaced by a number of Distributed Generation (DG) units that are placed at different locations and voltage levels in power networks. These distributed units are mostly based on renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaic cells and are commonly interfaced to the grid via power electronic converters. These sources reduce energy system dependency on conventional generation units based on fossil fuels. At the same time, this shift introduces technical challenges for the safe and reliable operation of electricity network since DG sources do not inherently provide the grid regulation services of conventional, centralised generation units. Moreover, the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and their converter-based interfaces is creating voltage deviation and voltage stability issues in distribution networks. These issues range from overvoltages during hours of peak renewable generation, reverse power flows and sudden voltage drops due to the variable nature of renewable energy production. All of the above jeopardise the reliable operation of the distribution networks that were not originally designed to accommodate for these effects. The objective of this thesis is to propose novel techniques for the accurate assessment of the DG impact on voltage stability in distribution net works and investigate how the control capabilities of converter-based interfaces of DG units can be harnessed to improve stability margins and overall system robustness and performance.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 24.14\%. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. This significantly strengthens system resilience, particularly in inertia-less power networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay Falaleev, Nikolai Orlov</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach for denoising Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) patterns using diffusion models. We propose a two-stage training process with a UNet-based architecture, incorporating an auxiliary regression head to predict the quality of the experimental pattern and assess the progress of the denoising process. The model uses an adaptive denoising strategy, which integrates quality prediction and feedback-driven iterative denoising process control. This adaptive feedback loop allows the model to adjust its schedule, providing fine control over the denoising process. Furthermore, our model can identify samples where no meaningful signal is present, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations. We demonstrate the successful application of diffusion models to EBSD pattern denoising using a custom-collected dataset of EBSD patterns, their corresponding master patterns, and quality values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riti Bhandarkar, Qian Luo, Emil Dimanchev, Jesse D. Jenkins</p>
            <p>While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions.</p>

            <p>The growing share of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources in power systems is increasing the need for short term operational flexibility, particularly from large industrial electricity consumers. This study proposes a practical, two stage optimization framework to unlock this flexibility in cement manufacturing and support participation in electricity balancing markets.

In Stage 2, a flexibility assessment model evaluates profitable deviations, targeting participation in Spain manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) market. A real world case study in a Spanish cement plant (including PV and battery storage) shows that flexibility services can yield monthly revenues of up to 800 EUR and paybacks as short as six years. This framework offers a replicable pathway for industrial flexibility in energy intensive sectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andres Intriago, Alexandros Paspatis, Francesco Liberati, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the power grid introduces new challenges, requiring detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies to analyze system interactions. Despite these needs, access to the internal firmware of power electronic devices remains restricted due to stringent nondisclosure agreements enforced by manufacturers. To address this, we explore three system identification techniques: sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA), step excitation method (SEM), and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA). SFRA employs sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies to measure the system's frequency response, while SEM and ERA utilize step functions to derive time-domain responses and transform them into Laplace-domain transfer functions. All three approaches are shown to provide consistent results in identifying the dq admittance of grid-forming inverters (GFM) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 Hz.</p>

            <h2>Towards Accurate Forecasting of Renewable Energy : Building Datasets and Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Solar and Wind Power in France</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eloi Lindas, Yannig Goude, Philippe Ciais</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiaki Kojima, Yuya Muto, Hikaru Akutsu, Rinnosuke Shima, Yoshihiko Susuki</p>
            <p>In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p>

            <h2>Neural Risk Limiting Dispatch in Power Networks: Formulation and Generalization Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ge Chen, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Risk limiting dispatch (RLD) has been proposed as an approach that effectively trades off economic costs with operational risks for power dispatch under uncertainty. However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches zero with high probability as more samples are utilized. Simulation tests across various systems demonstrate our method's superior performance in convergence, suboptimality, and computational efficiency compared with benchmarks.</p>

            <p>In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and we jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur</p>
            <p>The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</p>

Our numerical evaluation results show that compared with 5 classic algorithms based on phase data for imaging results, RINN's imaging results based on phaseless data are good, with indicators such as RRMSE (0.11) performing similarly well.

            <p>This article presents a unified approach to quadratic optimal control for both linear and nonlinear discrete-time systems, with a focus on trajectory tracking. The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function that penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their desired trajectories. For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution is derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for feedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the system and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy. To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on several canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on a moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that iLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of nonlinearities. To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to constraints and system uncertainties.</p>

            <p>The rapid growth of renewable energy generation challenges the secure operation of power systems. It becomes crucial to quantify the critical security boundaries and hosting capability of renewable generation at the system operation level. This paper proposes a novel point-hyperplane geometry (PHG) method to accurately obtain the geometric expression of the operational security region of renewable energy generation for power systems. Firstly, the geometric expression of the operational security region is defined as a polytope of boundary hyperplanes in the form of inequalities satisfying the system operation constraints. Then, an orthogonal basis generation method is proposed to solve a single boundary hyperplane of the polytope based on intersecting and orthogonal geometric principles. Next, a point-hyperplane iteration algorithm is developed to progressively obtain the overall geometric polytope of the operational security region of renewable energy generation in power systems. Besides, the flexible performance trade-off can be achieved by modifying the proposed maximum tolerated angle between adjacent hyperplanes. Finally, comprehensive case studies verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PHG method.</p>

Furthermore, PRIME can cope with non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise.

            <p>This paper proposes a novel prognostics-driven approach to optimize operations and maintenance (O&M) decisions in hydropower systems. Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.</p>

            <p>This letter demonstrates how synthetic inertia can be obtained with the control of flexible discrete devices to keep the power balance of power systems, even if the system does not include any synchronous generator or conventional grid-forming converter. The letter also discusses solutions to cycling issues, which can arise due to the interaction of uncoordinated discrete inertia controllers. The effectiveness, dynamic performance, and challenges of the proposed approach are validated through simulations using modified versions of the WSCC 9-bus test system and of the all-island Irish transmission system.</p>

            <h2>New Paradigm for Unified Near-Field and Far-Field Wireless Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaocheng Wang, Haochen Wu, Yuanbin Chen, Liyang Lu</p>
            <p>Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.</p>

            <h2>Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Optical Networks: Hype or Hope?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Doherty, Robin Matzner, Rasoul Sadeghi, Polina Bayvel, Alejandra Beghelli</p>
            <p>The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19-36% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Two-Stage Stochastic Optimal Power Flow via Separable Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shishir Lamichhane, Abodh Poudyal, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Anamika Dubey</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Security Assessment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin M. Peter, Mert Korkali</p>
            <p>The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Discrete Event Simulation Tool for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: Advancing System Efficiency and Scalability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khandaker Akramul Haque, Shining Sun, Xiang Huo, Ana E. Goulart, Katherine R. Davis</p>
            <p>Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks, necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical infrastructures. The challenge is that defense of large-scale systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE. The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000 buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

            <h2>Charging While Driving Lanes: A Boon to Electric Vehicle Owners or a Disruption to Traffic Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayan Bafandkar, Alireza Talebpour</p>
            <p>Large-scale adoption of commercial and personal Electric Vehicles (EVs) is expected to significantly affect traffic flow dynamics, emissions, and energy consumption in the transportation sector. Range anxiety and challenges associated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising solution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while driving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible to charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the traffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new congestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the effects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed harmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates (MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been investigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that introducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase congestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles aiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize traffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to increase in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses show significant reductions (up to 63\%) in pollution levels with increasing MPRs of personal and commercial EVs. Our analysis shows that while CWD lanes can facilitate the adoption of EVs, they can deteriorate traffic efficiency, emphasizing the importance of careful design and policy considerations.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing Downlink Coverage in Clustered Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miyeon Lee, Sucheol Kim, Minje Kim, Dong-Hyun Jung, Junil Choi</p>
            <p>Satellite networks are emerging as vital solutions for global connectivity beyond 5G. As companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon are poised to launch a large number of satellites in low Earth orbit, the heightened inter-satellite interference caused by mega-constellations has become a significant concern. To address this challenge, recent works have introduced the concept of satellite cluster networks where multiple satellites in a cluster collaborate to enhance the network performance. In order to investigate the performance of these networks, we propose mathematical analyses by modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes, building on the success of stochastic geometry-based analyses for satellite networks. In particular, we suggest the lower and upper bounds of the coverage probability as functions of the system parameters, including satellite density, satellite altitude, satellite cluster area, path loss exponent, and Nakagami parameter $m$. We validate the analytical expressions by comparing them with simulation results. Our analyses can be used to design reliable satellite cluster networks by effectively estimating the impact of system parameters on the coverage performance.</p>

            <h2>PV-VLM: A Multimodal Vision-Language Approach Incorporating Sky Images for Intra-Hour Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu</p>
            <p>The rapid proliferation of solar energy has significantly expedited the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into contemporary power grids. Considering that the cloud dynamics frequently induce rapid fluctuations in solar irradiance, accurate intra-hour forecasting is critical for ensuring grid stability and facilitating effective energy management. To leverage complementary temporal, textual, and visual information, this paper has proposed PV-VLM, a multimodal forecasting framework that integrates temporal, textual, and visual information by three modules. The Time-Aware Module employed a PatchTST-inspired Transformer to capture both local and global dependencies in PV power time series. Meanwhile, the Prompt-Aware Module encodes textual prompts from historical statistics and dataset descriptors via a large language model. Additionally, the Vision-Aware Module utilizes a pretrained vision-language model to extract high-level semantic features from sky images, emphasizing cloud motion and irradiance fluctuations. The proposed PV-VLM is evaluated using data from a 30-kW rooftop array at Stanford University and through a transfer study on PV systems at the University of Wollongong in Australia. Comparative experiments reveal an average RMSE reduction of approximately 5% and a MAE improvement of nearly 6%, while the transfer study shows average RMSE and MAE reductions of about 7% and 9.5%, respectively. Overall, PV-VLM leverages complementary modalities to provide a robust solution for grid scheduling and energy market participation, enhancing the stability and reliability of PV integration.</p>

            <h2>Joint Oscillation Damping and Inertia Provision Service for Converter-Interfaced Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Feng, Linbin Huang, Xiuqiang He, Yi Wang, Florian Dörfler, Chongqing Kang</p>
            <p>Power systems dominated by converter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) typically exhibit weaker damping capabilities and lower inertia, compromising system stability. Although individual DER controllers are evolving to provide superior oscillation damping capabilities and inertia supports, there is a lack of network-wide coordinated management measures for multiple DERs, potentially leading to unexpected instability and cost-effectiveness problems. To address this gap, this paper introduces a hybrid oscillation damping and inertia management strategy for multiple DERs, considering network coupling effects, and seeks to encourage DERs to provide enhanced damping and inertia with appropriate economic incentives. We first formulate an optimization problem to tune and allocate damping and inertia coefficients for DERs, minimizing associated power and energy costs while ensuring hard constraints for system frequency stability and small-signal stability. The problem is built upon a novel convex parametric formulation that integrates oscillation mode location and frequency trajectory requirements, equipped with a theoretical guarantee, and eliminating the need for iterative tuning and computation burdens. Furthermore, to increase the willingness of DERs to cooperate, we further design appropriate economic incentives to compensate for DERs' costs based on the proposed cost minimization problem, and assess its impact on system cost-efficiency. Numerical tests highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting system stability and offer insights into potential economic benefits.</p>
