            <h2>An Uncertainty-Aware Data-Driven Predictive Controller for Hybrid Power Plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manavendra Desai, Himanshu Sharma, Sayak Mukherjee, Sonja Glavaski</p>
            <p>Given the advancements in data-driven modeling for complex engineering and scientific applications, this work utilizes a data-driven predictive control method, namely subspace predictive control, to coordinate hybrid power plant components and meet a desired power demand despite the presence of weather uncertainties. An uncertainty-aware data-driven predictive controller is proposed, and its potential is analyzed using real-world electricity demand profiles. For the analysis, a hybrid power plant with wind, solar, and co-located energy storage capacity of 4 MW each is considered. The analysis shows that the predictive controller can track a real-world-inspired electricity demand profile despite the presence of weather-induced uncertainties and be an intelligent forecaster for HPP performance.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical RL-MPC for Demand Response Scheduling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Bloor, Ehecatl Antonio Del Rio Chanona, Calvin Tsay</p>
            <p>This paper presents a hierarchical framework for demand response optimization in air separation units (ASUs) that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with linear model predictive control (LMPC). We investigate two control architectures: a direct RL approach and a control-informed methodology where an RL agent provides setpoints to a lower-level LMPC. The proposed RL-LMPC framework demonstrates improved sample efficiency during training and better constraint satisfaction compared to direct RL control. Using an industrial ASU case study, we show that our approach successfully manages operational constraints while optimizing electricity costs under time-varying pricing. Results indicate that the RL-LMPC architecture achieves comparable economic performance to direct RL while providing better robustness and requiring fewer training samples to converge. The framework offers a practical solution for implementing flexible operation strategies in process industries, bridging the gap between data-driven methods and traditional control approaches.</p>

            <h2>Class E/EF Inductive Power Transfer to Achieve Stable Output under Variable Low Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Zhao, Mowei Lu, Heyuan Li, Zhenbin Zhang, Minfan Fu, Stefan M. Goetz</p>
            <p>This paper develops an inductive power transfer(IPT)system with stable output power based on a Class E/EF inverter. Load-independent design of Class E/EF inverter has recently attracted widespread interest. However, applying this design to IPT systems has proven challenging when the coupling coefficient is weak. To solve this issue, this paper uses an expanded impedance model and substitutes the secondary side's perfect resonance with a detuned design. Therefore, the system can maintain stable output even under a low coupling coefficient. A 400 kHz experimental prototype validates these findings. The experimental results indicate that the output power fluctuation remains within 15% as the coupling coefficient varies from 0.04 to 0.07. The peak power efficiency achieving 91%</p>

            <h2>Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Bhatt, Siddharth Penumatsa, Nirbhay Singhal</p>
            <p>The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration & Coordination Gains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasser Nabil, Hesham ElSawy, Hossam S. Hassanein</p>
            <p>This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.</p>

            <h2>Beam Pattern Modulation Embedded Hybrid Transceiver Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxun Liu, Shijian Gao, Zonghui Yang, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a promising technology for B5G/6G, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Multi-Connectivity in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Architectures, Challenges, and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang</p>
            <p>Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, especially the non-terrestrial network (NTN). The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. This article introduces three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, such as cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Subsequently, key technical challenges severely influencing the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</p>

            <h2>ClusMFL: A Cluster-Enhanced Framework for Modality-Incomplete Multimodal Federated Learning in Brain Imaging Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinpeng Wang, Rong Zhou, Han Xie, Xiaoying Tang, Lifang He, Carl Yang</p>
            <p>Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaboratively training multimodal models across distributed clients, particularly in healthcare domains. In the context of brain imaging analysis, modality incompleteness presents a significant challenge, where some institutions may lack specific imaging modalities (e.g., PET, MRI, or CT) due to privacy concerns, device limitations, or data availability issues. While existing work typically assumes modality completeness or oversimplifies missing-modality scenarios, we simulate a more realistic setting by considering both client-level and instance-level modality incompleteness in this study. Building on this realistic simulation, we propose ClusMFL, a novel MFL framework that leverages feature clustering for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis under modality incompleteness. Specifically, ClusMFL utilizes the FINCH algorithm to construct a pool of cluster centers for the feature embeddings of each modality-label pair, effectively capturing fine-grained data distributions. These cluster centers are then used for feature alignment within each modality through supervised contrastive learning, while also acting as proxies for missing modalities, allowing cross-modal knowledge transfer. Furthermore, ClusMFL employs a modality-aware aggregation strategy, further enhancing the model's performance in scenarios with severe modality incompleteness. We evaluate the proposed framework on the ADNI dataset, utilizing structural MRI and PET scans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ClusMFL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to various baseline methods across varying levels of modality incompleteness, providing a scalable solution for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Gain Modeling Technique for LLC Resonant Converters based on The Hybrid Deep-Learning/GMDH Neural Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parham Mohammadi</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for modeling the voltage gain of LLC resonant converters by combining deep-learning neural networks with the polynomial based Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). While deep learning offers high accuracy in predicting nonlinear converter behavior, it produces complex network models. GMDH neural networks, in contrast, yield simpler algebraic equations that can be more convenient in converter design. By training a deep network on data from an FPGA based real time simulator and then using the network s predictions to train a GMDH model, the proposed hybrid method achieves both high accuracy and design friendly simplicity. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional methods such as First Harmonic Approximation (FHA) and frequency domain corrections, particularly for wide operating ranges.</p>

            <h2>Generative AI Enabled Robust Data Augmentation for Wireless Sensing in ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiacheng Wang, Changyuan Zhao, Hongyang Du, Geng Sun, Jiawen Kang, Shiwen Mao, Dusit Niyato, Dong In Kim</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) uses the same software and hardware resources to achieve both communication and sensing functionalities. Thus, it stands as one of the core technologies of 6G and has garnered significant attention in recent years. In ISAC systems, a variety of machine learning models are trained to analyze and identify signal patterns, thereby ensuring reliable sensing and communications. However, considering factors such as communication rates, costs, and privacy, collecting sufficient training data from various ISAC scenarios for these models is impractical. Hence, this paper introduces a generative AI (GenAI) enabled robust data augmentation scheme. The scheme first employs a conditioned diffusion model trained on a limited amount of collected CSI data to generate new samples, thereby expanding the sample quantity. Building on this, the scheme further utilizes another diffusion model to enhance the sample quality, thereby facilitating the data augmentation in scenarios where the original sensing data is insufficient and unevenly distributed. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the acceleration and jerk of signal propagation path length changes from CSI. We then use the proposed scheme to enhance the estimated parameters and detect the number of targets based on the enhanced data. The evaluation reveals that our scheme improves the detection performance by up to 70%, demonstrating reliability and robustness, which supports the deployment and practical use of the ISAC network.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Frequency Transmission for Upload Latency Minimization of IoT Devices in HSR Scenario Aided by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyou Li, Tonghua Wei, Dapeng Li</p>
            <p>The explosively growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) in high-speed railway (HSR) scenario has attracted a lot of attention amongst researchers. However, limited IoT device (IoTD) batteries and large information upload latency still remain critical impediments to practical service applications. In this paper, we consider a HSR wireless mobile communication system, where two intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are deployed to help solve the problems above. Considering the carrier aggregation method, the IRS needs to be optimized globally in hybrid frequency bands. Meanwhile, to ensure information security, the transmission to the mobile communication relay (MCR) on the train is covert to passengers in the carriage by IRS. This problem is challenging to handle since the variables are coupled with each other and some tricky constraints. We firstly transform the original sum-of-ratios problem into the more tractable parametric problem. Then, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is adopted to decouple the problem into two main sub-problems, and the downlink and uplink settings are alternatively optimized using low-complexity iterative algorithms. Finally, a heuristic algorithm to mitigate the Doppler spread is proposed to further improve the performance. Simulation results corroborate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</p>

            <h2>Pricing is All You Need to Improve Traffic Routing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Tang, Kaan Ozbay, Li Jin</p>
            <p>We investigate the design of pricing policies that enhance driver adherence to route guidance, ensuring effective routing control. The major novelty lies in that we adopt a Markov chain to model drivers' compliance rates conditioned on both traffic states and tolls. By formulating the managed traffic network as a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, we can quantify in a more realistic way the impacts of driver route choices and thus determine appropriate tolls. Specially, we focus on a network comprised of one corridor and one local street. We assume that a reasonable routing policy is specified in advance. However, drivers could be reluctant to be detoured. Thus a fixed toll is set on the corridor to give drivers incentives to choose the local street. We evaluate the effectiveness of the given routing and pricing policies via stability analysis. We suggest using the stability and instability conditions to establish lower and upper bounds on throughput. This allows us to select suitable tolls that maximize these bounds.</p>

            <h2>FAMAC: A Federated Assisted Modified Actor-Critic Framework for Secured Energy Saving in 5G and Beyond Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Attai Ibrahim Abubakar, Michael S. Mollel, Metin Ozturk, Naeem Ramzan</p>
            <p>The constant surge in the traffic demand on cellular networks has led to continuous expansion in network capacity in order to accommodate existing and new service demands. This has given rise to ultra-dense base station deployment in 5G and beyond networks which leads to increased energy consumption in the network. Hence, these ultra-dense base station deployments must be operated in a way that the energy consumption of the network can be adapted to the spatio-temporal traffic demands on the network in order to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. To achieve this goal, we leverage two artificial intelligence algorithms, federated learning and actor-critic algorithm, to develop a proactive and intelligent base station switching framework that can learn the operating policy of the small base station in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network (UDHN) that would result in maximum energy saving in the network while respecting the quality of service (QoS) constraints. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.</p>

            <h2>Learning the Frequency Dynamics of the Power System Using Higher-order Dynamic Mode Decomposition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Li, Xinyi Wen, Benjamin Schäfer</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, characterised by low inertia and intermittent disturbances, presents substantial challenges to power system stability. As critical indicators of system stability, frequency dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena have attracted significant research attention. While existing studies predominantly employ linearized models, our findings demonstrate that linear approximations exhibit considerable errors when predicting frequency oscillation dynamics across multiple time scales, thus necessitating the incorporation of nonlinear characteristics. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on higher-order dynamical mode decomposition (HODMD) for learning frequency dynamics. The proposed method offers distinct advantages over alternative nonlinear methods, including no prior knowledge required, adaptability to high-dimensional systems, and robust performance. Furthermore, HODMD demonstrates superior capability in capturing system-wide spatio-temporal modes, successfully identifying modal behaviour that remains undetectable through standard Dynamic Mode Decomposition techniques. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive case studies on both IEEE 14-bus and WECC systems.</p>

            <h2>Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byunghyun Lee, Anindya Bijoy Das, David Love, Christopher Brinton, James Krogmeier</p>
            <p>Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. We consider the joint optimization of the spatial beam pattern and space-time correlation levels for better separating multiple targets in different angle and delay bins. In particular, we use the space-time correlation function to quantify the correlations between different angle and delay bins and formulate integrated sidelobe levels (ISLs). To serve communication users, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding to modulate information symbols, which leverages distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose a novel majorizing function for complex quadratic functions. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance the detection and estimation performance due to reduced space-time correlation levels.</p>

            <h2>CRC-Assisted Channel Codes for Integrated Passive Sensing and Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenghong Bian, Kaitao Meng, Huihui Wu, Yumeng Zhang, Deniz Gunduz</p>
            <p>We propose a novel coded integrated passive sensing and communication (CIPSAC) system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where a multi-antenna base station (BS) passively senses the parameters of the targets and decodes the information bit sequences transmitted by a user. The transmitted signal is comprised of pilot and data OFDM symbols where the data symbols adopt cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-assisted channel codes to facilitate both the decoding and sensing procedures. In the proposed scheme, CRC not only enhances the reliability of communication but also provides guidance to the parameter sensing procedure at the BS. In particular, a novel iterative parameter sensing and channel decoding (IPSCD) algorithm is proposed, where the correctly decoded codewords that pass CRC are utilized for sensing to improve the parameter estimation accuracy, and in return, more accurate parameter estimates lead to a larger number of correctly decoded data symbols. Conventional sensing algorithms rely only on the received pilot signals, while we utilize both the data and pilot signals for sensing. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal strategy, in which the wrongly decoded data packets are replaced by zero codewords. To further improve the performance, we introduce learning-based near-orthogonal superposition (NOS) codes, which exhibit superior error correction capability especially in the short block length regime. NOS codes are trained using a weighted loss function, where a hyper parameter is introduced to balance the sensing and the communication losses. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed CIPSAC system and the IPSCD algorithm, where both the sensing and decoding performances are significantly improved with a few iterations. We also carry out extensive ablation studies for a comprehensive understanding of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <h2>Performance of energy harvesters with parameter mismatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Burzyński, Piotr Brzeski, Przemysław Perlikowski</p>
            <p>This study explores the impact of parameter mismatch on the stability of cross-well motion in energy harvesters, using a basin stability metric. Energy harvesters, essential for converting ambient energy into electricity, increasingly incorporate multi-well systems to enhance efficiency. However, these systems are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter variations, which can affect their ability to sustain optimal cross-well motion -- a state associated with maximum power output. Our analysis compared four harvester types under varying levels of parameter mismatch, assessing resilience of the devices to parameter variations. By identifying safe operating ranges within the excitation parameter space, this study provides practical guidance for designing robust, stable harvesters capable of maintaining cross-well motion despite parameter uncertainties. These insights contribute to advancing the reliability of energy harvesting devices in real-world applications where parameter mismatches are inevitable.</p>

            <h2>Can Large Language Model Agents Balance Energy Systems?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinxing Ren, Chun Sing Lai, Gareth Taylor, Zekun Guo</p>
            <p>This paper presents a hybrid approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a multi-scenario Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) framework, focusing on both efficiency and reliability under high wind generation uncertainties. Numerical experiments on small-to-medium-sized test systems show that while the traditional SUC approach yields a total cost of 99.05 million USD with 3.04 GWh of load curtailment, the LLM-assisted SUC (LLM-SUC) reduces costs to 98.87 million USD and lowers load curtailment to 2.32 GWh, an improvement of nearly 24%. Both methods maintain zero wind curtailment, confirming robust renewable integration. By employing an LLM agent that helps balance the energy system more effectively, the proposed framework enhances demand fulfillment at reduced costs, illustrating the potential of AI to inform generator commitments in uncertain operating conditions. Further gains may be realized by refining prompt design, incorporating historical operational data, and extending this approach to higher-dimensional uncertainties and energy storage systems, ultimately fostering greater resilience, efficiency, and adaptability in next-generation power system operations.</p>

            <p>Multi-contrast MRI methods acquire multiple images with different contrast weightings, which are used for the differentiation of the tissue types or quantitative mapping. However, the scan time needed to acquire multiple contrasts is prohibitively long for 3D acquisition schemes, which can offer isotropic image resolution. While deep learning-based methods have been extensively used to accelerate 2D and 2D + time problems, the high memory demand, computation time, and need for large training data sets make them challenging for large-scale volumes. To address these challenges, we generalize the plug-and-play multi-scale energy-based model (MuSE) to a regularized subspace recovery setting, where we jointly regularize the 3D multi-contrast spatial factors in a subspace formulation. The explicit energy-based formulation allows us to use variable splitting optimization methods for computationally efficient recovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pratik Vernekar</p>
            <p>This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback linearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the linear-quadratic-Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC and INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the SMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and optimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems while remaining unaffected by the SMIB system's internal dynamics and operating conditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman filter, designed using the LTR procedure and a detailed frequency-domain loop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal performance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability margins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for constructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and nonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems by utilizing a high-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model, and the correlations between the two models' control inputs. Rigorous simulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a full-state linear-quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and trade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state error, robustness, rotor angle stability, frequency control, and voltage regulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to guide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power systems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.</p>

However, as the power system scales, the EMTP's computing complexity increases exponentially, leading to a curse of dimensionality that hinders its practical application. Facing this challenge, quantum computing offers a promising approach for achieving exponential acceleration. To realize this in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, the variational quantum linear solution (VQLS) was advocated because of its robustness against depolarizing noise. However, it suffers data inflation issues in its preprocessing phase, and no prior research has applied quantum computing to high-frequency switching EMT this http URL address these issues, this paper first designs the matrix low-dimension qubit casting (MLQC) method to address the data inflation problem in the preprocessing of the admittance matrix for VQLS in EMT networks. Besides, we propose a real-only quantum circuit reduction method tailored to the characteristics of the EMT network admittance matrices. Finally, the proposed quantum EMTP algorithm (QEMTP) has been successfully verified for EMT networks containing a large number of high-frequency switching elements.</p>

            <h2>A Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning Framework for Microgrid Energy Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Vivienne Liu, Patrick M. Reed, David Gold, Garret Quist, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The emergence of microgrids (MGs) has provided a promising solution for decarbonizing and decentralizing the power grid, mitigating the challenges posed by climate change. However, MG operations often involve considering multiple objectives that represent the interests of different stakeholders, leading to potentially complex conflicts. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that explores the high-dimensional objective space and uncovers the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. This framework leverages exogenous information and capitalizes on the data-driven nature of reinforcement learning, enabling the training of a parametric policy without the need for long-term forecasts or knowledge of the underlying uncertainty distribution. The trained policies exhibit diverse, adaptive, and coordinative behaviors with the added benefit of providing interpretable insights on the dynamics of their information use. We employ this framework on the Cornell University MG (CU-MG), which is a combined heat and power MG, to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate performance improvements in all objectives considered compared to the status quo operations and offer more flexibility in navigating complex operational tradeoffs.</p>

            <h2>Reserve Provision from Electric Vehicles: Aggregate Boundaries and Stochastic Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Thrän, Jakub Mareček, Robert N. Shorten, Timothy C. Green</p>
            <p>Controlled charging of electric vehicles, EVs, is a major potential source of flexibility to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce the need for stationary energy storage. To offer system services from EVs, fleet aggregators must address the uncertainty of individual driving and charging behaviour. This paper introduces a means of forecasting the service volume available from EVs by considering several EV batteries as one conceptual battery with aggregate power and energy boundaries. Aggregation avoids the difficult prediction of individual driving behaviour. The predictability of the boundaries is demonstrated using a multiple linear regression model which achieves a normalised root mean square error of 20% - 40% for a fleet of 1,000 EVs. A two-stage stochastic model predictive control algorithm is used to schedule reserve services on a day-ahead basis addressing risk trade-offs by including Conditional Value-at-Risk in the objective function. A case study with 1.2 million domestic EV charge records from Great Britain illustrates that increasing fleet size improves prediction accuracy, thereby increasing reserve revenues and decreasing an aggregator's operational costs. For fleet sizes of 400 or above, cost reductions plateau at 60% compared to uncontrolled charging, with an average of 1.8kW of reserve provided per vehicle.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norak Rin, Iman Shames, Ian R. Petersen, Elizabeth L. Ratnam</p>
            <p>In this paper, we quantify voltage and current phasor-based measurement requirements for the unique estimation of the electric grid topology and admittance parameters. Our approach is underpinned by the concept of a rigidity matrix that has been extensively studied in graph rigidity theory. Specifically, we show that the rank of the rigidity matrix is the same as that of a voltage coefficient matrix in a corresponding electric power system. Accordingly, we show that there is a minimum number of measurements required to uniquely estimate the admittance matrix and corresponding grid topology. By means of a numerical example on the IEEE 4-node radial network, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for applications in electric power grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lo Pang-Yun Ting, Ali Şenol, Huan-Yang Wang, Hsu-Chao Lai, Kun-Ta Chuang, Huan Liu</p>
            <p>The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ángel F. García-Fernández, Simo Särkkä</p>
            <p>This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.</p>

            <h2>Power System Electromagnetic Transient Stability: an Analysis Based on Convergent Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyuan Jiang, Constantino M. Lagoa, Yan Li</p>
            <p>Transient stability is crucial to the reliable operation of power systems. Existing theories rely on the simplified electromechanical models, substituting the detailed electromagnetic dynamics of inductor and capacitor with their impedance representations. However, this simplification is inadequate for the growing penetration of fast-switching power electronic devices. Attempts to extend the existing theories to include electromagnetic dynamics lead to overly conservative stability conditions. To tackle this problem more directly, we study the condition under which the power source and dissipation in the electromagnetic dynamics tend to balance each other asymptotically. This is equivalent to the convergence of the Hamiltonian (total stored energy) and can be shown to imply transient stability. Using contraction analysis, we prove that this property holds for a large class of time-varying port-Hamiltonian systems with (i) constant damping matrix and (ii) strictly convex Hamiltonian. Then through port-Hamiltonian modeling of the electromagnetic dynamics, we obtain that the synchronized steady state of the power system is globally stable if it exists. This result provides new insights into the reliable operation of power systems. The proposed theory is illustrated in the simulation results of a two-machine system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasu Sharma, Alexander Winkler, Armin Norouzi, Jakob Andert, David Gordon, Hongsheng Guo</p>
            <p>The urgent energy transition requirements towards a sustainable future stretch across various industries and are a significant challenge facing humanity. Hydrogen promises a clean, carbon-free future, with the opportunity to integrate with existing solutions in the transportation sector. However, adding hydrogen to existing technologies such as diesel engines requires additional modeling effort. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables interactive data-driven learning that eliminates the need for mathematical modeling. The algorithms, however, may not be real-time capable and need large amounts of data to work in practice. This paper presents a novel approach which uses offline model learning with RL to demonstrate safe control of a 4.5 L Hydrogen Diesel Dual-Fuel (H2DF) engine. The controllers are demonstrated to be constraint compliant and can leverage a novel state-augmentation approach for sample-efficient learning. The offline policy is subsequently experimentally validated on the real engine where the control algorithm is executed on a Raspberry Pi controller and requires 6 times less computation time compared to online Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Rodrigues de Brito, Daniel Simon Baltensperger, Kjetil Obstfelder Uhlen</p>
            <p>This work presents a framework for dynamic performance assessment of the higher layers in the hierarchical voltage regulation scheme, with case studies applied to specific areas of the Norwegian grid. Unlike the primary (PVR) level, the secondary (SVR) and tertiary (TVR) levels are not tuned to a single device at a time, handling instead several reactive power resources available within a control zone including generator units, static VAr compensators and others. Proper SVR-TVR coordination for realistic transmission systems is a challenging topic at the core of many ongoing discussions in voltage control literature. Special focus is placed on practical considerations from the system operator perspective, since this research is also aimed at simplifying daily control centre routines. Dynamic simulation results concern a 21-bus equivalent of a 132 kV network model that accurately represents a Norwegian grid subsystem. Case studies address daily grid operation with real-life load demand and wind power generation profiles, showing that the proposed strategy is effective not only to minimize total active power losses as much as possible within system-wide limitations, but also to maintain adequate voltage profiles and reactive power flows. Findings pertaining to this work showcase the benefits of applying hierarchical voltage regulation layers as an asset to day-to-day control center management of a realistic transmission network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo Gan, Li Junhui, Mu Gang, Yan Gangui</p>
            <p>Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are essential for peak shaving, balancing power supply and demand while enhancing grid efficiency. This study proposes a cycle-based control strategy for charging and discharging, which optimizes capture rate (CR), release rate (RR), and capacity utilization rate (CUR), improving BESS performance. Compared to traditional day-ahead methods, the cycle-based approach enhances operational accuracy and reduces capacity waste, achieving a CUR increase from 75.1% to 79.9%. An innovative cluster-level power allocation method, leveraging an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, is introduced. This strategy reduces daily energy loss by 174.21 kWh (3.7%) and increases BESS efficiency by 0.4%. Transient and steady-state energy loss components are analyzed, revealing that transient loss proportion decreases significantly as power depth increases, from 27.2% at 1 MW to 1.3% at 10 MW. Simulations based on a detailed Simulink/Simscape model validate these methods, demonstrating enhanced peak shaving effectiveness and prolonged BESS lifespan by reducing equivalent cycles. The study provides a robust framework for optimizing BESS performance and efficiency in real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Swarts, Jalal Kazempour, Wouter van den Akker, Johan Morren, Arjan van Voorden, Han Slootweg</p>
            <p>In response to increasing grid congestion in the Netherlands, non-firm connection and transport agreements (CTAs) and capacity restriction contracts (CRCs) have been introduced, allowing consumer curtailment in exchange for grid tariff discounts or per-MW compensations. This study examines the interaction between an electrolyzer project, facing sizing and contracting decisions, and a network operator, responsible for contract activations and determining grid connection capacity, under the new Dutch regulations. The interaction is modeled using two bilevel optimization problems with alternating leader-follower roles. Results highlight a trade-off between CRC income and non-firm CTA tariff discounts, showing that voluntary congestion management by the network operator increases electrolyzer profitability at CRC prices below 10 euro per MW but reduces it at higher prices. Furthermore, the network operator benefits more from reacting to the electrolyzer owner's CTA decisions than from leading the interaction at CRC prices above 10 euro per MW. Ignoring the other party's optimization problem overestimates profits for both the network operator and the electrolyzer owner, emphasizing the importance of coordinated decision-making.</p>

            <h2>S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunuo Chen, Qian Li, Bing He, Donghui Feng, Ronghua Wu, Qi Wang, Li Song, Guo Lu, Wenjun Zhang</p>
            <p>Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</p>

            <p>The integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids introduces significant operational challenges due to their intermittent nature and the mismatch between generation and demand patterns. Effective demand response (DR) strategies are crucial for maintaining system stability and economic efficiency, particularly in microgrids with high renewable penetration. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework for optimizing DR operations in a microgrid with solar generation and battery storage systems. The framework incorporates load classification, dynamic price thresholding, and multi-period coordination for optimal DR event scheduling. Analysis across seven distinct operational scenarios demonstrates consistent peak load reduction of 10\% while achieving energy cost savings ranging from 13.1\% to 38.0\%. The highest performance was observed in scenarios with high solar generation, where the framework achieved 38.0\% energy cost reduction through optimal coordination of renewable resources and DR actions. The results validate the framework's effectiveness in managing diverse operational challenges while maintaining system stability and economic efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Nguyen, Phuong Nguyen, Koen Kok</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the distribution system has led to the emergence of a new market actor - the aggregator. The aggregator serves as a facilitator, enabling flexibility asset owners to get access to different markets. In which, EVs aggregators are gaining more attention due to their expanding use and potential to provide services in various types of markets, particularly in the reserve market. Currently, TSO indirectly utilizes these resources under the management of the distribution system operators (DSO), which can negatively impact the distribution grid. Conversely, adjustments from DSOs can impact service provision to TSO due to the shortage of TSO usage information. These factors highlight the importance of evaluating the service provision from aggregators under different TSO-DSO coordination schemes. This paper focuses on the provision of flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs) aggregators for balancing service in the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed and compares it with the DSO-managed coordination schemes. The behavior of aggregators reacting to price fluctuations and TSO requests under different coordination schemes and simulation scenarios is thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, their impact on the grid is analyzed through the DSO's congestion management process and validated using data from a real part of the Dutch distribution network. Results find that the hybrid-managed coordination scheme gives more benefit to the aggregator than the DSO-managed scheme and the EVs aggregator will gain more profit in winter than summer due to more upward regulation service is needed.</p>

            <p>Fair cost allocation in community microgrids remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between multiple participants with varying load profiles, distributed energy resources, and storage systems. Traditional cost allocation methods often fail to adequately address the dynamic nature of participant contributions and benefits, leading to inequitable distribution of costs and reduced participant satisfaction. This paper presents a novel framework integrating multi-objective optimization with cooperative game theory for fair and efficient microgrid operation and cost allocation. The proposed approach combines mixed-integer linear programming for optimal resource dispatch with Shapley value analysis for equitable benefit distribution, ensuring both system efficiency and participant satisfaction. The framework was validated using real-world data across six distinct operational scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both technical and economic performance. Results show peak demand reductions ranging from 7.8% to 62.6%, solar utilization rates reaching 114.8% through effective storage integration, and cooperative gains of up to $1,801.01 per day. The Shapley value-based allocation achieved balanced benefit-cost distributions, with net positions ranging from -16.0% to +14.2% across different load categories, ensuring sustainable participant cooperation.</p>

            <p>Microgrids (MGs) play a crucial role in utilizing distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar and wind power, enhancing the sustainability and flexibility of modern power systems. However, the inherent variability in MG topology, power flow, and DER operating modes poses significant challenges to the accurate system identification of MGs, which is crucial for designing robust control strategies and ensuring MG stability. This paper proposes a Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (PC-SINDy) method for accurate MG system identification. By leveraging an analytically derived library of candidate functions, PC-SINDy extracts accurate dynamic models using only phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Simulations on a 4-bus system demonstrate that PC-SINDy can reliably and accurately predict frequency trajectories under large disturbances, including scenarios not encountered during the identification/training phase, even when using noisy, low-sampled PMU data.</p>

Also, while the runtime of the proposed method is in the range of the self-consumption maximization (SCM) approach as the fastest method, its electricity cost is about 3.2% cheaper than the SCM method. Simulation results also show that in case of providing grid services by the battery the difference between electricity cost of the proposed approach and MPC can reduce which makes the method good for such applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Xiao, Jongha Woo, Lidong Song, Ning Lu, Victor Paduani</p>
            <p>Co-simulation offers an integrated approach for modeling the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into transmission and distribution grids. This paper presents a scalable communication interface design and implementation to enable reliable and stable real-time co-simulation of power systems with high IBR penetration. The communication interface is categorized into two types: local and remote. In local scenarios, where subsystems are connected within a single local area network (LAN), low-latency communication facilitates the seamless integration of electromagnetic transient (EMT) and phasor-domain models, enabling efficient interactions with power and energy management algorithms. For remote scenarios, data exchange is achieved via internet-based file sharing or VPN-enabled communication. The performance of both methods is evaluated using OPAL-RT as a real-time simulator, demonstrating scalability, effectiveness, and challenges specific to real-time co-simulation applications. To mitigate instability arising from data resolution mismatches in time-sensitive co-simulations, a real-time data extrapolation method is proposed. This approach significantly enhances stability and reliability, ensuring more accurate simulation outcomes. The implementation code is available on GitHub, providing researchers the tools to replicate and expand upon this work.</p>

            <p>Accurate power load forecasting is essential for the efficient operation and planning of electrical grids, particularly given the increased variability and complexity introduced by renewable energy sources. This paper introduces GAT-LSTM, a hybrid model that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A key innovation of the model is the incorporation of edge attributes, such as line capacities and efficiencies, into the attention mechanism, enabling it to dynamically capture spatial relationships grounded in grid-specific physical and operational constraints. Additionally, by employing an early fusion of spatial graph embeddings and temporal sequence features, the model effectively learns and predicts complex interactions between spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, providing a realistic representation of the dynamics of power grids. Experimental evaluations on the Brazilian Electricity System dataset demonstrate that the GAT-LSTM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving reductions of 21. 8% in MAE, 15. 9% in RMSE and 20. 2% in MAPE. These results underscore the robustness and adaptability of the GAT-LSTM model, establishing it as a powerful tool for applications in grid management and energy planning.</p>

            <h2>Graph-based Simulation Framework for Power Resilience Estimation and Enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuesong Wang, Shuo Yuan, Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Caisheng Wang, Le Yi Wang</p>
            <p>The increasing frequency of extreme weather events poses significant risks to power distribution systems, leading to widespread outages and severe economic and social consequences. This paper presents a novel simulation framework for assessing and enhancing the resilience of power distribution networks under such conditions. Resilience is estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, which simulate extreme weather scenarios and evaluate the impact on infrastructure fragility. Due to the proprietary nature of power network topology, a distribution network is synthesized using publicly available data. To generate the weather scenarios, an extreme weather generation method is developed. To enhance resilience, renewable resources such as solar panels and energy storage systems (batteries in this study) are incorporated. A customized Genetic Algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal locations and capacities for solar panels and battery installations, maximizing resilience while balancing cost constraints. Experiment results demonstrate that on a large-scale synthetic distribution network with more than 300,000 nodes and 300,000 edges, the proposed framework can efficiently evaluate the resilience, and enhance the resilience through the installations of distributed energy resources (DERs), providing utilities with valuable insights for community-level power system resilience estimation and enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Multiple-Target Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Elfiatoure, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Hyundong Shin, Michail Matthaiou</p>
            <p>We propose a distributed implementation for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) backed by a massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) architecture without cells. Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs.</p>

            <h2>Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You</p>
            <p>The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</p>

            <h2>Real-time Optimization for Wind-to-H2 Driven Critical Infrastructures Based on Active Constraints Identification and Integer Variables Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Goodarzi, Qifeng Li</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a concept of wind-to-hydrogen-driven critical infrastructure (W2H-CI) as an engineering solution for decarbonizing the power generation sector where it utilizes wind power to produce hydrogen through electrolysis and combines it with the carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants. First, a convex mathematical model of W2H-CI is developed. Then, an optimization model for optimal operation of W2H-CI, which is a large-scale mixed-integer convex program (MICP), is proposed. Moreover, we propose to solve this problem in real-time in order to hedge against the uncertainty of wind power. For this purpose, a novel solution method based on active constraints identification and integer variable prediction is introduced. This method can solve MICP problems very fast since it uses historical optimization data to predict the values of binary variables and a limited number of constraints which most likely contain all active constraints. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed fast solution method using two W2H-CI case studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Abdolmaleki, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a centralized secondary control for the real-time steady-state optimization of multi-terminal HVdc grids under voltage and current limits. First, we present the dynamic models of the grid components, including the modular multilevel converter (MMC) stations and their different control layers. We also derive the quasi-static input-output model of the system, which is suitable for the steady-state control design. Second, we formulate a general optimization problem using this quasi-static model and find the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of its solutions. Third, we propose a secondary control based on primal-dual dynamics to adjust the voltage setpoints of the dispatchable MMCs, with which the system asymptotically converges to a steady state that satisfies these optimality conditions. Fourth, we provide a communication triggering mechanism to reduce the communication traffic between the secondary control unit and the MMC stations. Finally, we verify our proposal for different case studies by adapting it to an offshore multi-terminal HVdc grid composed of heterogeneous MMC stations simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The problems of proportional current minimization and loss reduction are two special case studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongyao Zhao, Zhenyu Liu, Wei Dai, Xinke Tang, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Yuhan Dong</p>
            <p>The uncertainty of the sensing target brings great challenge to the beamforming design of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To address this issue, we model the scattering coefficient and azimuth angle of the target as random variables and introduce a novel metric, expected detection probability (EPd), to quantify the average detection performance from a Bayesian perspective. Furthermore, we design a Bayesian beamforming scheme to optimize the expected detection probability under the limited power budget and communication performance constraints. A successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation-based (SCA-SDR) algorithm is developed for the complicated non-convex optimization problem corresponding to the beamforming scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other benchmarks and exhibits robust detection performance when parameters of the target are unknown and random.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Wenchuan Wu, Chenhui Lin, Qi Wang, Shuwei Xu, Binbin Chen</p>
            <p>As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can provide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal dispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal operation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of accurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the mathematical models of such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network (PIRN) model to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. The approach combines data-driven learning from measurement data with the fluid dynamics described by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical state-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification is transformed into a training process for a PIRN. Similar to standard recurrent neural networks, this model can be implemented using the PyTorch framework and trained via backpropagation. Case studies demonstrate that our method accurately estimates gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node measurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter efficiency. Furthermore, the identified models can be seamlessly integrated into optimization frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning for Scalable and Optimal Load Shedding Under Power System Contingency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Zhou, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>Prompt and effective corrective actions in response to unexpected contingencies are crucial for improving power system resilience and preventing cascading blackouts. The optimal load shedding (OLS) accounting for network limits has the potential to address the diverse system-wide impacts of contingency scenarios as compared to traditional local schemes. However, due to the fast cascading propagation of initial contingencies, real-time OLS solutions are challenging to attain in large systems with high computation and communication needs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized design that leverages offline training of a neural network (NN) model for individual load centers to autonomously construct the OLS solutions from locally available measurements. Our learning-for-OLS approach can greatly reduce the computation and communication needs during online emergency responses, thus preventing the cascading propagation of contingencies for enhanced power grid resilience. Numerical studies on both the IEEE 118-bus system and a synthetic Texas 2000-bus system have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our scalable OLS learning design for timely power system emergency operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialong Lu, Rujing Xiong, Tiebin Mi, Ke Yin, Robert Caiming Qiu</p>
            <p>The existing methods for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) beamforming in wireless communications are typically limited to uniform phase quantization. However, in practical applications, engineering challenges and design requirements often lead to non-uniform phase and bit resolution of RIS units, which limits the performance potential of these methods. To address this issue, this paper pioneers the study of discrete non-uniform phase configuration in RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication and formulates an optimization model to characterize the problem. For single-user scenarios, the paper proposes a partition-andtraversal (PAT) algorithm that efficiently achieves the global optimal solution through systematic search and traversal. For larger-scale multi-user scenarios, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity, an enhanced PAT-based algorithm (E-PAT) is developed. By optimizing the search strategy, the E-PAT algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves linear complexity. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PAT and EPAT algorithms. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the impact of non-uniform phase quantization on system performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuangkun Wei, Wenxiu Hu, Yathreb Bouazizi, Mengbang Zou, Chenguang Liu, Yunfei Chen, Hongjian Sun, Julie McCann</p>
            <p>Coordinated controlling a large UAV swarm requires significant spectrum resources due to the need for bandwidth allocation per UAV, posing a challenge in resource-limited environments. Over-the-air (OTA) control has emerged as a spectrum-efficient approach, leveraging electromagnetic superposition to form control signals at a base station (BS). However, existing OTA controllers lack sufficient optimization variables to meet UAV swarm control objectives and fail to integrate control with other BS functions like sensing. This work proposes an integrated sensing and OTA control framework (ISAC-OTA) for UAV swarm. The BS performs OTA signal construction (uplink) and dispatch (downlink) while simultaneously sensing objects. Two uplink post-processing methods are developed: a control-centric approach generating closed-form control signals via a feedback-looped OTA control problem, and a sensing-centric method mitigating transmission-induced interference for accurate object sensing. For the downlink, a non-convex problem is formulated and solved to minimize control signal dispatch (transmission) error while maintaining a minimum sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that the proposed ISAC-OTA controller achieves control performance comparable to the benchmark optimal control algorithm while maintaining high sensing accuracy, despite OTA transmission interference. Moreover, it eliminates the need for per-UAV bandwidth allocation, showcasing a spectrum-efficient method for cooperative control in future wireless systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boqun Zhao, Chongjun Ouyang, Xingqi Zhang, Hyundong Shin, Yuanwei Liu</p>
            <p>A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. Within this framework, continuous operator-based signal models are employed to describe the sensing and communication processes. The performance of communication and sensing is analyzed using two information-theoretic metrics: the communication rate (CR) and the sensing rate (SR). 1) For downlink ISAC, three continuous beamforming designs are proposed: i) the communications-centric (C-C) design that maximizes the CR, ii) the sensing-centric (S-C) design that maximizes the SR, and iii) the Pareto-optimal design that characterizes the Pareto boundary of the CR-SR region. A signal subspace-based approach is proposed to derive the closed-form optimal beamformers for the considered designs. On this basis, closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable CRs and SRs, and the downlink rate region achieved by CAPAs is characterized. 2) For uplink ISAC, the C-C and S-C successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based methods are proposed to manage inter-functionality interference. Using the subspace approach along with the time-sharing technique, closed-form expressions for the optimal beamformers are derived, and the achievable CRs, SRs, and rate region are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that, for both downlink and uplink, CAPA-based ISAC achieves higher CRs and SRs as well as larger CR-SR regions compared to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-based ISAC.</p>

AC OPF is essential for minimizing generation costs while meeting the operational constraints of the grid.

Our approach models the power grid as a graph, where buses are nodes and transmission lines are edges. We explore different GNN architectures, including GCN, GAT, SAGEConv, and GraphConv to predict AC power flow solutions efficiently. Our experiments on IEEE test systems show that GNNs can accurately predict power flow solutions and scale to larger systems, outperforming traditional solvers in terms of computation time. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for real-time power grid management, with future plans to apply the model to even larger grid systems.</p>

            <p>The cooperative operation of grid-edge power and energy resources is crucial to improving the resilience of power systems during contingencies. However, given the complex cyber-physical nature of power grids, it is hard to respond timely with limited costs for deploying additional cyber and/or phyiscal resources, such as during a high-impact low-frequency cyber-physical event. Therefore, the paper examines the design of cooperative cyber-physical resource optimization solutions to control grid-tied cyber and physical resources. First, the operation of a cyber-physical power system is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, including the cyber and physical objectives and constraints. Then, a bi-level solution is provided to obtain optimal cyber and physical actions, including the reconfiguration of cyber topology (e.g., activation of communication links) in the cyber layer and the control of physical resources (e.g., energy storage systems) in the physical layer. The developed method improves grid resilience during cyberattacks and can provide guidance on the control of coupled physical side resources. Numerical simulation on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p>This paper puts forward the vision of creating a library of neural-network-based models for power system simulations. Traditional numerical solvers struggle with the growing complexity of modern power systems, necessitating faster and more scalable alternatives. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer promise to solve fast the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing power system dynamics. This is vital for the reliability, cost optimization, and real-time decision-making in the electricity grid. Despite their potential, standardized frameworks to train PINNs remain scarce. This poses a barrier for the broader adoption and reproducibility of PINNs; it also does not allow the streamlined creation of a PINN-based model library. This paper addresses these gaps. It introduces a Python-based toolbox for developing PINNs tailored to power system components, available on GitHub https://github. com/radiakos/PowerPINN. Using this framework, we capture the dynamic characteristics of a 9th-order system, which is probably the most complex power system component trained with a PINN to date, demonstrating the toolbox capabilities, limitations, and potential improvements. The toolbox is open and free to use by anyone interested in creating PINN-based models for power system components.</p>

            <p>The introduction of intelligent interconnectivity between the physical and human worlds has attracted great attention for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, emphasizing massive capacity, ultra-low latency, and unparalleled reliability. Wireless distributed networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), both of which have evolved from centralized paradigms, are two promising solutions for the great attention. Given their distinct capabilities, such as decentralization and collaborative mechanisms, integrating these two paradigms holds great promise for unleashing the full power of 6G, attracting significant research and development attention. This paper provides a comprehensive study on MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks for 6G. In particular, we introduce the basic mathematical background and evolution of wireless distributed networks and MARL, as well as demonstrate their interrelationships. Subsequently, we analyze different structures of wireless distributed networks from the perspectives of homogeneous and heterogeneous. Furthermore, we introduce the basic concepts of MARL and discuss two typical categories, including model-based and model-free. We then present critical challenges faced by MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks, providing important guidance and insights for actual implementation. We also explore an interplay between MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks and emerging techniques, such as information bottleneck and mirror learning, delivering in-depth analyses and application scenarios.

The approach uses multidirectional, widely distributed currents on conductive surfaces that are placed around the target volume. It generates multiple, mutually unique, three-dimensional magnetic field patterns, where each pattern is attributed to different eigenmodes of a single room-scale resonator. Using these modes together, a power delivery efficiency exceeding 37.1% can be achieved throughout a 3 m * 3 m * 2 m test room. With this approach, power exceeding 50 W could potentially be delivered to mobile receivers in accordance with safety guidelines.</p>

We achieve this by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic scenes. Notably, we introduce optimization methods to enhance planning efficiency for this time-sensitive task. Our proposed system can adapt to various object types, arrangements and movement speeds without the need for extensive training, as demonstrated by real-world experiments.</p>

            <p>Time delay estimation (TDE) plays a key role in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) using adaptive filter method. Considerable residual echo will be left if estimation error arises. Here, in this paper, we proposed an adaptive filter bank based neural network approach where the delay is estimated by a bank of adaptive filters with overlapped time scope, and all the energy of filter weights are concatenated and feed to a classification network. The index with maximal probability is chosen as the estimated delay. Based on this TDE, an AEC scheme is designed using a neural network for residual echo and noise suppression, and the optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA) algorithm is adopted to make it robust. Also, a robust automatic gain control (AGC) scheme with spectrum smoothing method is designed to amplify speech segments. Performance evaluations reveal that higher performance can be achieved for our scheme.</p>

            <p>We study a stochastic perishable inventory control problem with endogenous (decision-dependent) uncertainty in shelf-life of units. Our primary motivation is determining ordering policies for blood platelets. Determining optimal ordering quantities is a challenging task due to the short maximum shelf-life of platelets (3-5 days after testing) and high uncertainty in daily demand. We formulate the problem as an infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP). The model captures salient features observed in our data from a network of Canadian hospitals and allows for fixed ordering costs. We show that with uncertainty in shelf-life, the value function of the MDP is non-convex and key structural properties valid under deterministic shelf-life no longer hold. Hence, we propose an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm to find approximate policies. We approximate the value function using a linear combination of basis functions and tune the parameters using a simulation-based policy iteration algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy using extensive numerical experiments in parameter regimes relevant to the platelet inventory management problem. We further leverage the ADP algorithm to evaluate the impact of ignoring shelf-life uncertainty. Finally, we evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the ADP algorithm in a case study using real data and compare it to the historical hospital performance and other benchmarks. The ADP policy can be computed online in a few minutes and results in more than 50% lower expiry and shortage rates compared to the historical performance. In addition, it performs better or as well as an exact policy that ignores uncertainty in shelf-life and becomes hard to compute for larger instance of the problem.</p>

Consider a scenario where the sensor and the controller communicate via a networked channel, the transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process on unbounded general state space controlled by scheduling decisions. The value of information (VoI) serves as a metric to assess the importance of sensory data for transmission. We derive the optimal scheduling law for feedback control based on VoI and show that it is deterministic and stationary, with an explicit expression obtained via value iteration. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling law is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the dynamic behavior of the iteration process, we show that the VoI function and the optimal scheduling law exhibit symmetry. Furthermore, when the system matrix is diagonalizable, the VoI function is monotone and quasi-convex. Consequently, the optimal scheduling law is shown to exhibit a threshold structure and takes a quadratic form, with the threshold region explicitly characterized. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Resilient Asymmetric Bipartite Consensus: A Data-Driven Event-Triggered Mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Shan Zuo</p>
            <p>The problem of asymmetric bipartite consensus control is investigated within the context of nonlinear, discrete-time, networked multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To address the challenges posed by these aperiodic DoS attacks, a data-driven event-triggered (DDET) mechanism has been developed. This mechanism is specifically designed to synchronize the states of the follower agents with the leader's state, even in the face of aperiodic communication disruptions and data losses. Given the constraints of unavailable agents' states and data packet loss during these attacks, the DDET control framework resiliently achieves leader-follower consensus. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two numerical examples, which showcase its ability to adeptly handle the complexities arising from aperiodic DoS attacks in nonlinear MAS settings.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Incentive Selection for Hierarchical Convex Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Thirugnanam, Koushil Sreenath</p>
            <p>In this paper, we discuss incentive design for hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) systems viewed as Stackelberg games. We consider a hierarchical MPC formulation where, given a lower-level convex MPC (LoMPC), the upper-level system solves a bilevel MPC (BiMPC) subject to the constraint that the lower-level system inputs are optimal for the LoMPC. Such hierarchical problems are challenging due to optimality constraints in the BiMPC formulation. We analyze an incentive Stackelberg game variation of the problem, where the BiMPC provides additional incentives for the LoMPC cost function, which grants the BiMPC influence over the LoMPC inputs. We show that for such problems, the BiMPC can be reformulated as a simpler optimization problem, and the optimal incentives can be iteratively computed without knowing the LoMPC cost function. We extend our formulation for the case of multiple LoMPCs and propose an algorithm that finds bounded suboptimal solutions for the BiMPC. We demonstrate our algorithm for a dynamic price control example, where an independent system operator (ISO) sets the electricity prices for electric vehicle (EV) charging with the goal of minimizing a social cost and satisfying electricity generation constraints. Notably, our method scales well to large EV population sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neetu R.R, Ozan Alp Topal, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson, Cicek Cavdar, Gourab Ghatak, Vivek Ashok Bohara</p>
            <p>We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple antennas serve as distributed UAV-access points (UAV-APs). These UAV-APs provide seamless coverage by jointly serving user equipments (UEs) with out predefined cell boundaries. However, high-capacity wireless networks face significant challenges due to fronthaul limitations in UAV-assisted architectures. This letter proposes a novel UAV-based cell-free mMIMO framework that leverages distributed UAV-APs to serve UEs while addressing the capacity constraints of wireless fronthaul links. We evaluate functional split Options 7.2 and 8 for the fronthaul links, aiming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the UEs and minimize the power consumption by optimizing the transmit powers of UAV-APs and selectively activating them. Our analysis compares sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for the fronthaul, showing that mmWave achieves superior SINR with lower power consumption, particularly under Option 8. Additionally, we determine the minimum fronthaul bandwidth required to activate a single UAV-AP under different split options.</p>

            <h2>Joint Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems with Hybrid-Colluding Eavesdroppers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meiding Liu, Zhengchun Zhou, Qiao Shi, Guyue Li, Zilong Liu, Pingzhi Fan, Inkyu Lee</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the physical layer security (PLS) problem for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the presence of hybrid-colluding eavesdroppers, where an active eavesdropper (AE) and a passive eavesdropper (PE) collude to intercept the confidential information. To ensure the accuracy of sensing while preventing the eavesdropping, a base station transmits a signal consisting of information symbols and sensing waveform, in which the sensing waveform can be also used as artificial noise to interfere with eavesdroppers. Under this setup, we propose an alternating optimization-based two stage scheme (AO-TSS) for improving the sensing and communication performance. In the first stage, based on the assumptions that the perfect channel state information (CSI) of the AE and statistical CSI of the PE are known, the communication and sensing beamforming problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the beampattern matching mean squared error (MSE) and cross-correlation, subject to the secure transmission constraint. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithm and a reduced-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm. Then, the scenarios are further extended to more general cases with imperfect AE CSI and unknown PE CSI. To further improve the communication performance, the second-stage problem is developed to optimize the secrecy rate threshold under the radar performance constraint. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of sensing and secure communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amine Salaje, Thomas Chevet, Nicolas Langlois</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme. The controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Furthermore, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with parametrized NMPC as function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Shimane, Stefano Di Cairano, Koki Ho, Avishai Weiss</p>
            <p>We develop a model predictive control (MPC) policy for station-keeping (SK) on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed policy achieves full-state tracking of a reference NRHO via a two-maneuver control horizon placed one revolution apart. Our method abides by the typical mission requirement that at most one maneuver is used for SK during each NRHO revolution. Simultaneously, the policy has sufficient controllability for full-state tracking, making it immune to phase deviation issues in the along-track direction of the reference NRHO, a common drawback of existing SK methods with a single maneuver per revolution. We report numerical simulations with a navigation filter to demonstrate the MPC's performance with output feedback. Our approach successfully maintains the spacecraft's motion in the vicinity of the reference in both space and phase, with tighter tracking than state-of-the-art SK methods and comparable delta-V performance.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Use of Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles for Supporting Power Grid Operations</h2>

            <p>This paper explores the use of autonomous unmanned vehicles to support power grid operations. With built-in batteries and the capability to carry additional battery energy storage, the rising number of autonomous vehicles can represent a substantial amount of capacity that is currently underutilized in the power grid. Unlike traditional electric vehicles that require drivers, the operations of autonomous vehicles can be performed without human intervention. To guide idle vehicles to autonomously support power grids, we propose a tractable optimization-based method to effectively integrate these "mobile batteries" into grid operations. During real-time operations, the vehicles are strategically routed to target locations to maintain power balance and reduce operating costs. Numerical studies have confirmed both the validity and the scalability of the proposed algorithm to efficiently integrate autonomous vehicles into routine power system operations.</p>

            <p>Due to the fundamental transition to a power electronic dominated power system, the increasing diversity of dynamic elements underscores the need to assess their similarity to mature electrical engineering models. This article addresses the concept of the Dynamic Similarity Index (DSI) for its use in, power electronics-dominated networks. The DSI is a multipurpose tool developed to be used by different stakeholders (e.g., converter manufacturers and system operators). Such an index is calculated per frequency, which serves to anticipate potential differences in particular frequency ranges of interest between the model under study and the reference model. Within the scope of this study, the dynamic similarity of inverter-based generators to an ideal voltage source behind an impedance is assessed, due to the relevance of this fundamental circuit in the representation of generation units in power system studies. The article presents two potential applications based on this mathematical framework. First, for manufacturers to evaluate control performance compared to a reference model and second, it enables operators to diagnose buses with voltage vulnerability based on a user-defined reference Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) value. The DSI results for these two case studies are validated using Matlab Simulink simulations.</p>

However, as the number of antennas increases, ELAA systems face significant bottlenecks, such as excessive interconnection costs and high computational complexity. Efficient distributed signal processing (SP) algorithms show great promise in overcoming these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these bottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems: single-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and ELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review the associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we outline several important future research directions that are essential for improving the performance and practicality of ELAA systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vineet Jagadeesan Nair, Anuradha Annaswamy</p>
            <p>We propose a market designed using game theory to optimally utilize the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible loads. Market agents perform multiperiod optimization to determine their feasible flexibility limits for power injections while satisfying all constraints of their DERs. This is followed by a Stackelberg game between the market operator and agents. The market operator as the leader aims to regulate the aggregate power injection around a desired value by leveraging the flexibility of their agents, and computes optimal prices for both electricity and flexibility services. The agents follow by optimally bidding their desired flexible power injections in response to these prices. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium among all the agents and a Stackelberg equilibrium between all agents and the operator. In addition to deriving analytical closed-form solutions, we provide simulation results for a small example system to illustrate our approach.</p>

            <p>Residential electrification - replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric machines - can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, installing electric appliances or vehicle charging in a residential building can sharply increase its current draws. In older housing, high current draws can jeopardize electrical infrastructure, such as circuit breaker panels or electrical service (the wires that connect a building to the distribution grid). Upgrading electrical infrastructure can entail long delays and high costs, so poses a significant barrier to electrification. This paper develops and field-tests a control system that avoids the need for electrical upgrades by keeping an electrified home's total current draw within the safe limits of its panel and service. In the proposed control architecture, a high-level controller plans device set-points over a rolling prediction horizon. A low-level controller monitors real-time conditions and ramps down devices if necessary. The control system was tested in an occupied, electrified single-family house with code-minimum insulation, an air-to-air heat pump and backup resistance heat, a resistance water heater, and a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with Level I charging. The field tests spanned 31 winter days with outdoor temperatures as low as -20 C. The control system maintained the whole-home current within the safe limits of electrical panels and service rated at 100 A, a common rating for older houses in North America, by adjusting only the temperature set-points of the heat pump and water heater. Simulations suggest that the same 100 A limit could accommodate a second electric vehicle with Level II charging. The proposed control system could allow older homes to safely electrify without upgrading electrical panels or service, saving a typical household on the order of $2,000 to $10,000.</p>

The proposed methodology targets system modes associated with the slower dynamics of the grid, enabling precise predictions through modal decomposition applied to the full system model. This decomposition facilitates an analytical solution for the frequency at the center of inertia, resulting in highly accurate predictions of both frequency response and nadir. Numerical results from a 39-bus, 10-machine test system verify the method's effectiveness and accuracy. This methodology represents a shift from observing a simplified average system frequency response to a more detailed analysis focusing on system dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Thrän, Tim C. Green, Robert Shorten</p>
            <p>To make well-informed investment decisions, energy system stakeholders require reliable cost frameworks for demand response (DR) and storage technologies. While the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) permits comprehensive cost comparisons between different storage technologies, no generic cost measure for the comparison of different DR schemes exists. This paper introduces the levelised cost of demand response (LCODR) which is an analogous measure to the LCOS but crucially differs from it by considering consumer reward payments. Additionally, the value factor from cost estimations of variable renewable energy is adapted to account for the variable availability of DR. The LCODRs for four direct load control (DLC) schemes and twelve storage applications are estimated and contrasted against LCOS literature values for the most competitive storage technologies. The DLC schemes are vehicle-to-grid, smart charging, smart heat pumps, and heat pumps with thermal storage. The results show that only heat pumps with thermal storage consistently outcompete storage technologies with EV-based DR schemes being competitive for some applications. The results and the underlying methodology offer a tool for energy system stakeholders to assess the competitiveness of DR schemes even with limited user data.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leon Lan, Alessandro Zocca</p>
            <p>In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line switching actions. Several tree partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsara Benazir, Felix Xiaozhu Lin</p>
            <p>Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce XYZ, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of XYZ hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement XYZ on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. XYZ with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. XYZ is 16x smaller in memory and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</p>

Design, implementation, maintenance and coordination of SIPS are all important aspects for desired operation. However, different actors have chosen different approaches to using SIPS for capacity enhancement, and there are discrepancies in how capacity is valued in relation to for example complexity, reliability and risk. Additionally, definitions often vary between countries. This paper reports on a joint survey and interview study on SIPS with stakeholders and experts in the Nordic countries - including TSOs, DSOs and industry. Combined with a literature review, a comparison and analysis of how SIPS are used in the Nordics is performed, particularly in relation to ENTSO-E capacity allocation.</p>

            <h2>Improving Power Plant CO2 Emission Estimation with Deep Learning and Satellite/Simulated Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dibyabha Deb, Kamal Das</p>
            <p>CO2 emissions from power plants, as significant super emitters, contribute substantially to global warming. Accurate quantification of these emissions is crucial for effective climate mitigation strategies. While satellite-based plume inversion offers a promising approach, challenges arise from data limitations and the complexity of atmospheric conditions. This study addresses these challenges by (a) expanding the available dataset through the integration of NO2 data from Sentinel-5P, generating continuous XCO2 maps, and incorporating real satellite observations from OCO-2/3 for over 71 power plants in data-scarce regions; and (b) employing a customized U-Net model capable of handling diverse spatio-temporal resolutions for emission rate estimation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods. By leveraging this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of major CO2 emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and informing regulatory frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Towards Data-Driven Multi-Stage OPF</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksii Molodchyk, Philipp Schmitz, Alexander Engelmann, Karl Worthmann, Timm Faulwasser</p>
            <p>The operation of large-scale power systems is usually scheduled ahead via numerical optimization. However, this requires models of grid topology, line parameters, and bus specifications. Classic approaches first identify the network topology, i.e., the graph of interconnections and the associated impedances. The power generation schedules are then computed by solving a multi-stage optimal power flow (OPF) problem built around the model. In this paper, we explore the prospect of data-driven approaches to multi-stage optimal power flow. Specifically, we leverage recent findings from systems and control to bypass the identification step and to construct the optimization problem directly from data. We illustrate the performance of our method on a 118-bus system and compare it with the classical identification-based approach.</p>

            <h2>Towards Efficient Multi-Objective Optimisation for Real-World Power Grid Topology Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yassine El Manyari, Anton R. Fuxjager, Stefan Zahlner, Joost Van Dijk, Alberto Castagna, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Marcel Wasserer</p>
            <p>Power grid operators face increasing difficulties in the control room as the increase in energy demand and the shift to renewable energy introduce new complexities in managing congestion and maintaining a stable supply. Effective grid topology control requires advanced tools capable of handling multi-objective trade-offs. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for tackling such challenges, existing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) approaches fail to scale to the large state and action spaces inherent in real-world grid operations. Here we present a two-phase, efficient and scalable Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) method designed for grid topology control, combining an efficient RL learning phase with a rapid planning phase to generate day-ahead plans for unseen scenarios. We validate our approach using historical data from TenneT, a European Transmission System Operator (TSO), demonstrating minimal deployment time, generating day-ahead plans within 4-7 minutes with strong performance. These results underline the potential of our scalable method to support real-world power grid management, offering a practical, computationally efficient, and time-effective tool for operational planning. Based on current congestion costs and inefficiencies in grid operations, adopting our approach by TSOs could potentially save millions of euros annually, providing a compelling economic incentive for its integration in the control room.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Lautenbacher, Ali Rajaei, Davide Barbieri, Jan Viebahn, Jochen L. Cremer</p>
            <p>Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</p>

            <p>Joint phase-time arrays (JPTA) is a new mmWave radio frequency front-end architecture constructed with appending time-delay elements to phase shifters for analog beamforming. JPTA allows the mmWave base station (BS) to form multiple frequency-dependent beams with a single RF chain, exploiting the extra degrees of freedom the time-delay elements offer. Without requiring extra power-hungry RF chains, a BS with JPTA can schedule multiple users in different directions in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) manner. A BS with JPTA achieves various advantages over the traditional analog beamforming system. Simulation results show that JPTA can bring significant system-level benefits, e.g., extending uplink throughput coverage by 100%. To realize these system benefits of JPTA, high-resolution delay elements with a wide delay dynamic range are essential. With newly developed delay elements, we demonstrate that a single TRX RF chain can serve four users in four different directions in the mmWave band.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillermo Sarasa, Ana Granados, Francisco B Rodríguez</p>
            <p>P300 is an Event-Related Potential widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces, but its detection is challenging due to inter-subject and temporal variability. This work introduces a clustering methodology based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to extract the P300 structure, ensuring robustness against variability. We propose a novel signal-to-ASCII transformation to generate compression-friendly objects, which are then clustered using a hierarchical tree-based method and a multidimensional projection approach. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the method's ability to reveal relevant P300 structures, showing clustering performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, analysis at the electrode level suggests that the method could assist in electrode selection for P300 detection. This compression-driven clustering methodology offers a complementary tool for EEG analysis and P300 identification.</p>

            <h2>Provably-Stable Neural Network-Based Control of Nonlinear Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anran Li, John P. Swensen, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh</p>
            <p>In recent years, Neural Networks (NNs) have been employed to control nonlinear systems due to their potential capability in dealing with situations that might be difficult for conventional nonlinear control schemes. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature on NN-based control lacks theoretical guarantees for stability and tracking performance. This precludes the application of NN-based control schemes to systems where stringent stability and performance guarantees are required. To address this gap, this paper proposes a systematic and comprehensive methodology to design provably-stable NN-based control schemes for affine nonlinear systems. Rigorous analysis is provided to show that the proposed approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop system with the NN in the loop. Also, it is shown that the resulting NN-based control scheme ensures that system states asymptotically converge to a neighborhood around the desired equilibrium point, with a tunable proximity threshold. The proposed methodology is validated and evaluated via simulation studies on an inverted pendulum and experimental studies on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.</p>

            <h2>SigWavNet: Learning Multiresolution Signal Wavelet Network for Speech Emotion Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alaa Nfissi, Wassim Bouachir, Nizar Bouguila, Brian Mishara</p>
            <p>In the field of human-computer interaction and psychological assessment, speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in deciphering emotional states from speech signals. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to system complexity, feature distinctiveness issues, and noise interference. This paper introduces a new end-to-end (E2E) deep learning multi-resolution framework for SER, addressing these limitations by extracting meaningful representations directly from raw waveform speech signals. By leveraging the properties of the fast discrete wavelet transform (FDWT), including the cascade algorithm, conjugate quadrature filter, and coefficient denoising, our approach introduces a learnable model for both wavelet bases and denoising through deep learning techniques. The framework incorporates an activation function for learnable asymmetric hard thresholding of wavelet coefficients. Our approach exploits the capabilities of wavelets for effective localization in both time and frequency domains. We then combine one-dimensional dilated convolutional neural networks (1D dilated CNN) with a spatial attention layer and bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) with a temporal attention layer to efficiently capture the nuanced spatial and temporal characteristics of emotional features. By handling variable-length speech without segmentation and eliminating the need for pre or post-processing, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and EMO-DB datasets.

            <h2>Do Audio-Visual Segmentation Models Truly Segment Sounding Objects?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Li, Wenjie Zhao, Ziru Huang, Yunhui Guo, Yapeng Tian</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) requires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to determine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging transformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have achieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important question remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to segment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this issue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in current methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly on visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in unreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this challenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark incorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient noise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach combining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided similarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS methods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the prevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable improvements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining near-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdul Rehman, Ilona Heldal, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin</p>
            <p>Self Supervised Representation Learning (SSRepL) can capture meaningful and robust representations of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) data and have the potential to improve the model's performance on also downstream different types of Neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) detection. In this paper, a novel SSRepL and Transfer Learning (TL)-based framework that incorporates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) model is proposed to detect children with potential symptoms of ADHD. This model uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals extracted during visual attention tasks to accurately detect ADHD by preprocessing EEG signal quality through normalization, filtering, and data balancing. For the experimental analysis, we use three different models: 1) SSRepL and TL-based LSTM-GRU model named as SSRepL-ADHD, which integrates LSTM and GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data, 2) lightweight SSRepL-based DNN model (LSSRepL-DNN), and 3) Random Forest (RF). In the study, these models are thoroughly evaluated using well-known performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). The results show that the proposed SSRepL-ADHD model achieves the maximum accuracy of 81.11% while admitting the difficulties associated with dataset imbalance and feature selection.</p>

            <h2>When End-to-End is Overkill: Rethinking Cascaded Speech-to-Text Translation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Min, Chenxu Hu, Yi Ren, Hang Zhao</p>
            <p>Though end-to-end speech-to-text translation has been a great success, we argue that the cascaded speech-to-text translation model still has its place, which is usually criticized for the error propagation between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) models. In this paper, we explore the benefits of incorporating multiple candidates from ASR and self-supervised speech features into MT. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause of cascading errors stems from the increased divergence between similar samples in the speech domain when mapped to the text domain. By including multiple candidates and self-supervised speech features, our approach allows the machine translation model to choose the right words and ensure precise translation using various speech samples. This strategy minimizes error spread and takes advantage of large ASR and MT datasets, along with pre-trained ASR/MT models, while addressing associated issues.</p>

This method offers a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between text inputs and audio outputs, enhancing both the explainability and trustworthiness of TAG models.

            <p>The deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained micro-controllers has gained momentum, driving many advancements in Tiny Neural Networks. This paper introduces a tiny feed-forward neural network, TinyFC, integrated into the Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs). Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers are widely used in FOC for their simplicity, although their limitations in handling nonlinear dynamics hinder precision. To address this issue, a lightweight 1,400 parameters TinyFC was devised to enhance the FOC performance while fitting into the computational and memory constraints of a micro-controller. Advanced optimization techniques, including pruning, hyperparameter tuning, and quantization to 8-bit integers, were applied to reduce the model's footprint while preserving the network effectiveness. Simulation results show the proposed approach significantly reduced overshoot by up to 87.5%, with the pruned model achieving complete overshoot elimination, highlighting the potential of tiny neural networks in real-time motor control applications.</p>

            <h2>Complex Wavelet Mutual Information Loss: A Multi-Scale Loss Function for Semantic Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renhao Lu</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the performance of semantic segmentation. However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited for capturing high-dimensional directional features and exhibits greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khashayar Ghanizadegan, Hashim A. Hashim</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the orientation, position, and velocity of a vehicle operating in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN.

            <p>This work introduces the Query/Hit (Q/H) learning model. The setup consists of two agents. One agent, Alice, has access to a streaming source, while the other, Bob, does not have direct access to the source. Communication occurs through sequential Q/H pairs: Bob sends a sequence of source symbols (queries), and Alice responds with the waiting time until each query appears in the source stream (hits). This model is motivated by scenarios with communication, computation, and privacy constraints that limit real-time access to the source. The error exponent for sequential hypothesis testing under the Q/H model is characterized, and a querying strategy, the Dynamic Scout-Sentinel Algorithm (DSSA), is proposed. The strategy employs a mutual information neural estimator to compute the error exponent associated with each query and to select the query with the highest efficiency. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets -- including mouse movement trajectories, typesetting patterns, and touch-based user interactions -- are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy in comparison with baselines, in terms of probability of error, query choice, and time-to-detection.</p>

            <p>Deploying mixed-precision neural networks on edge devices is friendly to hardware resources and power consumption. To support fully mixed-precision neural network inference, it is necessary to design flexible hardware accelerators for continuous varying precision operations. However, the previous works have issues on hardware utilization and overhead of reconfigurable logic. In this paper, we propose an efficient accelerator for 2~8-bit precision scaling with serial activation input and parallel weight preloaded. First, we set two loading modes for the weight operands and decompose the weight into the corresponding bitwidths, which extends the weight precision support efficiently. Then, to improve hardware utilization of low-precision operations, we design the architecture that performs bit-serial MAC operation with systolic dataflow, and the partial sums are combined spatially. Furthermore, we designed an efficient carry save adder tree supporting both signed and unsigned number summation across rows. The experiment result shows that the proposed accelerator, synthesized with TSMC 28nm CMOS technology, achieves peak throughput of 4.09TOPS and peak energy efficiency of 68.94TOPS/W at 2/2-bit operations.</p>

            <p>Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</p>

It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</p>

            <h2>"I am bad": Interpreting Stealthy, Universal and Robust Audio Jailbreaks in Audio-Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isha Gupta, David Khachaturov, Robert Mullins</p>
            <p>The rise of multimodal large language models has introduced innovative human-machine interaction paradigms but also significant challenges in machine learning safety. Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are especially relevant due to the intuitive nature of spoken communication, yet little is known about their failure modes. This paper explores audio jailbreaks targeting ALMs, focusing on their ability to bypass alignment mechanisms. We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal. These results have important implications for understanding the interactions between different modalities in multimodal models, and offer actionable insights for enhancing defenses against adversarial audio attacks.</p>

            <h2>CycleGuardian: A Framework for Automatic RespiratorySound classification Based on Improved Deep clustering and Contrastive Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Chu, Qiuhao Wang, Enze Zhou, Ling Fu, Qian Liu, Gang Zheng</p>
            <p>Auscultation plays a pivotal role in early respiratory and pulmonary disease diagnosis. Despite the emergence of deep learning-based methods for automatic respiratory sound classification post-Covid-19, limited datasets impede performance enhancement. Distinguishing between normal and abnormal respiratory sounds poses challenges due to the coexistence of normal respiratory components and noise components in both types. Moreover, different abnormal respiratory sounds exhibit similar anomalous features, hindering their differentiation. Besides, existing state-of-the-art models suffer from excessive parameter size, impeding deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. To address these issues, we design a lightweight network CycleGuardian and propose a framework based on an improved deep clustering and contrastive learning. We first generate a hybrid spectrogram for feature diversity and grouping spectrograms to facilitating intermittent abnormal sound this http URL, CycleGuardian integrates a deep clustering module with a similarity-constrained clustering component to improve the ability to capture abnormal features and a contrastive learning module with group mixing for enhanced abnormal feature discernment. Multi-objective optimization enhances overall performance during training. In experiments we use the ICBHI2017 dataset, following the official split method and without any pre-trained weights, our method achieves Sp: 82.06 $\%$, Se: 44.47$\%$, and Score: 63.26$\%$ with a network model size of 38M, comparing to the current model, our method leads by nearly 7$\%$, achieving the current best performances. Additionally, we deploy the network on Android devices, showcasing a comprehensive intelligent respiratory sound auscultation system.</p>

            <h2>Role of Mixup in Topological Persistence Based Knowledge Distillation for Wearable Sensor Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eun Som Jeon, Hongjun Choi, Matthew P. Buman, Pavan Turaga</p>
            <p>The analysis of wearable sensor data has enabled many successes in several applications. To represent the high-sampling rate time-series with sufficient detail, the use of topological data analysis (TDA) has been considered, and it is found that TDA can complement other time-series features. Nonetheless, due to the large time consumption and high computational resource requirements of extracting topological features through TDA, it is difficult to deploy topological knowledge in various applications. To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) can be adopted, which is a technique facilitating model compression and transfer learning to generate a smaller model by transferring knowledge from a larger network. By leveraging multiple teachers in KD, both time-series and topological features can be transferred, and finally, a superior student using only time-series data is distilled. On the other hand, mixup has been popularly used as a robust data augmentation technique to enhance model performance during training. Mixup and KD employ similar learning strategies. In KD, the student model learns from the smoothed distribution generated by the teacher model, while mixup creates smoothed labels by blending two labels. Hence, this common smoothness serves as the connecting link that establishes a connection between these two methods. In this paper, we analyze the role of mixup in KD with time-series as well as topological persistence, employing multiple teachers. We present a comprehensive analysis of various methods in KD and mixup on wearable sensor data.</p>

            <h2>A method for estimating forest carbon storage distribution density via artificial intelligence generated content model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Yu, Jinnian Wang</p>
            <p>Forest is the most significant land-based carbon storage mechanism. The forest carbon sink can effectively decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration and mitigate climate change. Remote sensing estimation not only ensures high accuracy of data, but also enables large-scale area observation. Optical images provide the possibility for long-term monitoring, which is a potential issue in the future carbon storage estimation research. We chose Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China as the study area, took GF-1 WFV satellite image as the data, introduced the KD-VGG module to extract the initial features, and proposed the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM). The results showed that: (1) The VGG-19 module after knowledge distillation can realize the initial feature extraction, reduce the inference time and improve the accuracy in the case of reducing the number of model parameters. (2) The Attention + MLP module was added for feature fusion to obtain the relationship between global and local features and realized the restoration of high-fidelity images in the continuous scale range. (3) The IIDM model proposed in this paper had the highest estimation accuracy, with RMSE of 28.68, which was 13.16 higher than that of the regression model, about 31.45%. In the estimation of carbon storage, the generative model can extract deeper features, and its performance was significantly better than other models. It demonstrated the feasibility of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in the field of quantitative remote sensing and provided valuable insights for the study of carbon neutralization effect. By combining the actual characteristics of the forest, the regional carbon storage estimation with a resolution of 16-meter was utilized to provide a significant theoretical basis for the formulation of forest carbon sink regulation.</p>

            <h2>Adversarial Semantic Augmentation for Training Generative Adversarial Networks under Limited Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengping Yang, Zhe Wang, Ziqiu Chi, Dongdong Li, Wenli Du</p>
            <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made remarkable achievements in synthesizing images in recent years. Typically, training GANs requires massive data, and the performance of GANs deteriorates significantly when training data is limited. To improve the synthesis performance of GANs in low-data regimes, existing approaches use various data augmentation techniques to enlarge the training sets. However, it is identified that these augmentation techniques may leak or even alter the data distribution. To remedy this, we propose an adversarial semantic augmentation (ASA) technique to enlarge the training data at the semantic level instead of the image level. Concretely, considering semantic features usually encode informative information of images, we estimate the covariance matrices of semantic features for both real and generated images to find meaningful transformation directions. Such directions translate original features to another semantic representation, e.g., changing the backgrounds or expressions of the human face dataset. Moreover, we derive an upper bound of the expected adversarial loss. By optimizing the upper bound, our semantic augmentation is implicitly achieved. Such design avoids redundant sampling of the augmented features and introduces negligible computation overhead, making our approach computation efficient. Extensive experiments on both few-shot and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improve the synthesis quality under various data regimes, and further visualized and analytic results suggesting satisfactory versatility of our proposed method.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a Newton-based stochastic extremum-seeking control method for real-time optimization in multi-input systems with distinct input delays. It combines predictor-based feedback and Hessian inverse estimation via stochastic perturbations to enable delay compensation with user-defined convergence rates. The method ensures exponential stability and convergence near the unknown extremum, even under long delays. It extends to multi-input, single-output systems with cross-coupled channels. Stability is analyzed using backstepping and infinite-dimensional averaging. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in handling time-delayed channels, showcasing both the challenges and benefits of real-time optimization in distributed parameter settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed Karimi-Bidhendi, Giovanni Geraci, Hamid Jafarkhani</p>
            <p>We present a general mathematical framework for optimizing cell deployment and antenna configuration in wireless networks, inspired by quantization theory. Unlike traditional methods, our framework supports networks with deterministically located nodes, enabling modeling and optimization under controlled deployment scenarios. We demonstrate our framework through two applications: joint fine-tuning of antenna parameters across base stations (BSs) to optimize network coverage, capacity, and load balancing, and the strategic deployment of new BSs, including the optimization of their locations and antenna settings. These optimizations are conducted for a heterogeneous 3D user population, comprising ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) along aerial corridors. Our case studies highlight the framework's versatility in optimizing performance metrics such as the coverage-capacity trade-off and capacity per region. Our results confirm that optimizing the placement and orientation of additional BSs consistently outperforms approaches focused solely on antenna adjustments, regardless of GUE distribution. Furthermore, joint optimization for both GUEs and UAVs significantly enhances UAV service without severely affecting GUE performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Hugo Pereira Rodrigues, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Miroslav Krstic, Paulo Tabuada</p>
            <p>This paper proposes the incorporation of static event-triggered control in the actuation path of Newton-based extremum seeking and its comparison with the earlier gradient version. As in the continuous methods, the convergence rate of the gradient approach depends on the unknown Hessian of the nonlinear map to be optimized, whereas the proposed event-triggered Newton-based extremum seeking eliminates this dependence, becoming user-assignable. This is achieved by means of a dynamic estimator for the Hessian's inverse, implemented as a Riccati equation filter. Lyapunov stability and averaging theory for discontinuous systems are applied to analyze the closed-loop system. Local exponential practical stability is guaranteed to a small neighborhood of the extremum point of scalar and static maps. Numerical simulations illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach over the previous gradient method, including improved convergence speed, followed by a reduction in the amplitude and updating frequency of the control signals.</p>

            <p>In this study, we introduce a novel method to predict mental health by building machine learning models for a non-invasive wearable device equipped with Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) and Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FS) sensors. Besides, we present the corresponding dataset to predict mental health, e.g. depression, anxiety, and stress levels via the DAS-21 questionnaire. To our best knowledge, this is the world's largest and the most generalized dataset ever collected for both LDF and FS studies. The device captures cutaneous blood microcirculation parameters, and wavelet analysis of the LDF signal extracts key rhythmic oscillations. The dataset, collected from 132 volunteers aged 18-94 from 19 countries, explores relationships between physiological features, demographics, lifestyle habits, and health conditions. We employed a variety of machine learning methods to classify stress detection, in which LightGBM is identified as the most effective model for stress detection, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.7168 and a PR AUC of 0.8852. In addition, we also incorporated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques into our analysis to investigate deeper insights into the model's predictions. Our results suggest that females, younger individuals and those with a higher Body Mass Index (BMI) or heart rate have a greater likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions like stress and anxiety.

            <h2>Emotional Face-to-Speech</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Ye, Boyuan Cao, Hongming Shan</p>
            <p>How much can we infer about an emotional voice solely from an expressive face? This intriguing question holds great potential for applications such as virtual character dubbing and aiding individuals with expressive language disorders. Existing face-to-speech methods offer great promise in capturing identity characteristics but struggle to generate diverse vocal styles with emotional expression. In this paper, we explore a new task, termed emotional face-to-speech, aiming to synthesize emotional speech directly from expressive facial cues. To that end, we introduce DEmoFace, a novel generative framework that leverages a discrete diffusion transformer (DiT) with curriculum learning, built upon a multi-level neural audio codec. Specifically, we propose multimodal DiT blocks to dynamically align text and speech while tailoring vocal styles based on facial emotion and identity. To enhance training efficiency and generation quality, we further introduce a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning algorithm for multi-level token processing. In addition, we develop an enhanced predictor-free guidance to handle diverse conditioning scenarios, enabling multi-conditional generation and disentangling complex attributes effectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEmoFace generates more natural and consistent speech compared to baselines, even surpassing speech-driven methods.

            <h2>Parallel Coding for Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Li, Jinhong Yuan, Min Qiu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel parallel coding transmission strategy and an iterative detection and decoding receiver signal processing technique for orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a parallel channel encoding (PCE) scheme that consists of multiple short-length codewords for each delay-Doppler multicarrier (DDMC) symbol. Building upon such a PCE transmission framework, we then introduce an iterative detection and decoding algorithm incorporating a successive decoding feedback (SDF) technique, which enables instant information exchange between the detector and decoder for each DDMC symbol. To characterize the error performance of the proposed scheme, we perform density evolution analysis considering the finite blocklength effects. Our analysis results, coupled with extensive simulations, demonstrate that the proposed PCE scheme with the SDF algorithm not only showcases a better overall performance but also requires much less decoding complexity to implement, compared to the conventional benchmark scheme that relies on a single long channel code for coding the entire ODDM frame.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel autoregressive modeling approach for speech synthesis, combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a multi-modal latent space and an autoregressive model that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) as the conditional probability distribution. Unlike previous methods that rely on residual vector quantization, our model leverages continuous speech representations from the VAE's latent space, greatly simplifying the training and inference pipelines. We also introduce a stochastic monotonic alignment mechanism to enforce strict monotonic alignments. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive model VALL-E in both subjective and objective evaluations, achieving these results with only 10.3\% of VALL-E's parameters. This demonstrates the potential of continuous speech language models as a more efficient alternative to existing quantization-based speech language models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dabin Kim, Inkyu Jang, Youngsoo Han, Sunwoo Hwang, H. Jin Kim</p>
            <p>Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</p>

            <p>Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based foundation models are gaining traction due to the widespread use of PPG in biosignal monitoring and their potential to generalize across diverse health applications. In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p>

            <p>Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</p>

            <p>Backdoor attacks have posed a significant threat to the security of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite considerable strides in developing defenses against backdoor attacks in the visual domain, the specialized defenses for the audio domain remain empty. Furthermore, the defenses adapted from the visual to audio domain demonstrate limited effectiveness. To fill this gap, we propose Gradient Norm-based FineTuning (GN-FT), a novel defense strategy against the attacks in the audio domain, based on the observation from the corresponding backdoored models. Specifically, we first empirically find that the backdoored neurons exhibit greater gradient values compared to other neurons, while clean neurons stay the lowest. On this basis, we fine-tune the backdoored model by incorporating the gradient norm regularization, aiming to weaken and reduce the backdoored neurons. We further approximate the loss computation for lower implementation costs. Extensive experiments on two speech recognition datasets across five models demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first specialized and effective defense against backdoor attacks in the audio domain.</p>

By leveraging solutions from the lower-level problems and employing parametric optimization techniques, we solve the upper-level problem using a standard sequential quadratic programming approach. The paper concludes by presenting an illustrative numerical example that highlights the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to scenarios where no coordination between traffic lights and vehicles exists.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Cerone, S. M. Fosson, S. Pirrera, D. Regruto</p>
            <p>Multivariate polynomial optimization is a prevalent model for a number of engineering problems. From a mathematical viewpoint, polynomial optimization is challenging because it is non-convex. The Lasserre's theory, based on semidefinite relaxations, provides an effective tool to overcome this issue and to achieve the global optimum. However, this approach can be computationally complex for medium and large scale problems. For this motivation, in this work, we investigate a local minimization approach, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which is low-complex, straightforward to implement, and prone to decentralization. The core of the work is the development of the algorithm tailored to polynomial optimization, along with the proof of its convergence. Through a numerical example we show a practical implementation and test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with respect to state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>

            <h2>Embrace Collisions: Humanoid Shadowing for Deployable Contact-Agnostics Motions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziwen Zhuang, Hang Zhao</p>
            <p>Previous humanoid robot research works treat the robot as a bipedal mobile manipulation platform, where only the feet and hands contact the environment. However, we humans use all body parts to interact with the world, e.g., we sit in chairs, get up from the ground, or roll on the floor. Contacting the environment using body parts other than feet and hands brings significant challenges in both model-predictive control and reinforcement learning-based methods. An unpredictable contact sequence makes it almost impossible for model-predictive control to plan ahead in real time. The success of the zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning method for humanoids heavily depends on the acceleration of GPU-based rigid-body physical simulator and simplification of the collision detection. Lacking extreme torso movement of the humanoid research makes all other components non-trivial to design, such as termination conditions, motion commands and reward designs. To address these potential challenges, we propose a general humanoid motion framework that takes discrete motion commands and controls the robot's motor action in real time. Using a GPU-accelerated rigid-body simulator, we train a humanoid whole-body control policy that follows the high-level motion command in the real world in real time, even with stochastic contacts and extremely large robot base rotation and not-so-feasible motion command.

            <h2>Simultaneous Automatic Picking and Manual Picking Refinement for First-Break</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowen Bai, Zixiang Zhao, Jiangshe Zhang, Yukun Cui, Chunxia Zhang, Zhenbo Guo, Yongjun Wang</p>
            <p>First-break picking is a pivotal procedure in processing microseismic data for geophysics and resource exploration. Recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break. Nevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement for detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential mislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively affect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle outliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking and Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier samples or even noisy labels. Unlike conventional approaches that regard manual picks as ground truth, our method treats the true first-break as a latent variable within a probabilistic model that includes a first-break labeling prior. SPR aims to uncover this variable, enabling dynamic adjustments and improved accuracy across the dataset. This strategy mitigates the impact of outliers or inaccuracies in manual labels. Intra-site picking experiments and cross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our method's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across different sites. Additionally, our investigations into noisy signals and labels underscore SPR's resilience to both types of noise and its capability to refine misaligned manual annotations. Moreover, the flexibility of SPR, not being limited to any single network architecture, enhances its adaptability across various deep learning-based picking methods. Focusing on learning from data that may contain outliers or partial inaccuracies, SPR provides a robust solution to some of the principal obstacles in automatic first-break picking.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic object goal pushing with mobile manipulators through model-free constrained reinforcement learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Dadiotis, Mayank Mittal, Nikos Tsagarakis, Marco Hutter</p>
            <p>Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.</p>

            <h2>A Differentiable Alignment Framework for Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling via Optimal Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yacouba Kaloga, Shashi Kumar, Petr Motlicek, Ina Kodrasi</p>
            <p>Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric, called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method considerably improves alignment performance, though with a trade-off in ASR performance when compared to CTC. We believe this work opens new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development within the community.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Bereyhi, Saba Asaad, Chongjun Ouyang, Zhiguo Ding, H. Vincent Poor</p>
            <p>Pinching antennas have been recently proposed as a promising flexible-antenna technology, which can be implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. This work explores the potential of employing pinching antenna systems (PASs) for downlink transmission in a multiuser MIMO setting. We consider the problem of hybrid beamforming, where the digital precoder at the access point and the activated locations of the pinching elements are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable weighted sum-rate. Invoking fractional programming, a novel low-complexity algorithm is developed to iteratively update the precoding matrix and the locations of the pinching antennas. We validate the proposed scheme through extensive numerical experiments. Our investigations demonstrate that using PAS the system throughput can be significantly boosted as compared with the conventional fixed-location antenna systems, enlightening the potential of PAS as an enabling candidate for next-generation wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Tian, Chau-Wai Wong, Sushant M. Ranadive, Min Wu</p>
            <p>Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an important indicator for pulmonary and respiratory functionalities. Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO$_2$. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone's camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO$_2$ monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO$_2$ information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO$_2$ prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.</p>

            <h2>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Airaldi, Bart De Schutter, Azita Dabiri</p>
            <p>In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</p>

            <p>Major cities worldwide experience problems with the performance of their road transportation systems, and the continuous increase in traffic demand presents a substantial challenge to the optimal operation of urban road networks and the efficiency of traffic control strategies. The operation of transportation systems is widely considered to display fragile property, i.e., the loss in performance increases exponentially with the linearly increasing magnitude of disruptions. Meanwhile, the risk engineering community is embracing the novel concept of antifragility, enabling systems to learn from historical disruptions and exhibit improved performance under black swan events. In this study, based on established traffic models, namely fundamental diagrams and macroscopic fundamental diagrams, we first conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis to prove the fragile nature of the systems theoretically. Subsequently, we propose a skewness-based indicator that can be readily applied to cross-compare the degree of fragility for different networks solely dependent on the MFD-related parameters. At last, by taking real-world stochasticity into account, we implemented a numerical simulation with realistic network data to bridge the gap between the theoretical proof and the real-world operations, to reflect the potential impact of uncertainty on the fragility of the systems. This work aims to demonstrate the fragile nature of road transportation systems and help researchers better comprehend the necessity to consider explicitly antifragile design for future traffic control strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hexin Liu, Xiangyu Zhang, Haoyang Zhang, Leibny Paola Garcia, Andy W. H. Khong, Eng Siong Chng, Shinji Watanabe</p>
            <p>Code-switching (CS) refers to the switching of languages within a speech signal and results in language confusion for automatic speech recognition (ASR). To address language confusion, we introduce a novel language alignment loss into ASR training to align acoustic features to pseudo-language labels learned from the ASR decoder. This approach enables frame-level language identification without the need for frame-level language annotations. To further tackle the complex token alternatives for language modeling in bilingual scenarios, we propose to employ large language models via a generative error correction method. A linguistic hint, which is derived from LAL outputs and decoded hypotheses, is introduced to guide the prompting and enhance the LLM-based generative error correction for CS-ASR. The proposed methods are evaluated on the SEAME dataset and data from the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition challenge. The incorporation of the proposed language alignment loss improves the CS-ASR performance for both hybrid CTC/attention and Whisper models on both datasets, with only a negligible increase in the number of parameters. This work also highlights the efficacy of language alignment loss in balancing primary-language-dominant bilingual data during training, with an 8.6% relative improvement on the ASRU dataset compared to the baseline model. Performance evaluation using large language models reveals the advantage of the linguistic hint by achieving 14.1% and 5.5% relative improvement on test sets of the ASRU and SEAME datasets, respectively.</p>

            <p>This paper develops an adaptive state tracking control scheme for discrete-time systems, using the least-squares algorithm, as the new solution to the long-standing discrete-time adaptive state tracking control problem to which the Lyapunov method (well-developed for the continuous-time adaptive state tracking problem) is not applicable. The new adaptive state tracking scheme is based on a recently-developed new discrete-time error model which has been used for gradient algorithm based state tracking control schemes, and uses the least-squares algorithm for parameter adaptation. The new least-squares algorithm is derived to minimize an accumulative estimation error, to ensure certain optimality for parameter estimation. The system stability and output tracking properties are studied. Technical results are presented in terms of plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, optimality formulation, and stability and tracking analysis. The developed adaptive control scheme is applied to a discrete-time multiple mobile robot system to meet an adaptive state tracking objective. In addition, a collision avoidance mechanism is proposed to prevent collisions in the whole tracking process. Simulation results are presented, which verify the desired system state tracking properties under the developed least-squares algorithm based adaptive control scheme.</p>

            <p>Weakly supervised segmentation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations during model training. However, the current weakly supervised nuclei segmentation approaches typically follow a two-stage pseudo-label generation and network training process. The performance of the nuclei segmentation heavily relies on the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, thereby limiting its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel domain-adaptive weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework using cross-task interaction strategies to overcome the challenge of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, we utilize weakly annotated data to train an auxiliary detection task, which assists the domain adaptation of the segmentation network. To enhance the efficiency of domain adaptation, we design a consistent feature constraint module integrating prior knowledge from the source domain. Furthermore, we develop pseudo-label optimization and interactive training methods to improve the domain transfer capability. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive comparative and ablation experiments on six datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing weakly supervised approaches. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable or even better performance than fully supervised methods. Our code will be released in this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Kazma, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>The rapid increase in the integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources (RER) introduces challenging issues related to power system stability. Interestingly, identifying grid nodes that can best support stochastic loads from RER, has gained recent interest. Methods based on Lyapunov stability are commonly exploited to assess the stability of power networks. These strategies approach quantifying system stability while considering: (i) simplified reduced order power system models that do not model power flow constraints, or (ii) data-driven methods that are prone to measurement noise and hence can inaccurately depict stochastic loads as system instability. In this paper, while considering a nonlinear differential algebraic equation (NL-DAE) model, we introduce a new method for assessing the impact of uncertain renewable power injections on the stability of power system nodes/buses. The identification of stable nodes informs the operator/utility on how renewables injections affect the stability of the grid. The proposed method is based on optimizing metrics equivalent to the Lyapunov spectrum of exponents; its underlying properties result in a computationally efficient and scalable stable node identification algorithm for renewable energy resources allocation. The developed framework is studied on various standard power networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoon Huh, Hyowoon Seo, Wan Choi</p>
            <p>From the perspective of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), there has been significant research on utilizing semantic communication, which inherently possesses analog characteristics, within digital device environments. However, a single-model approach that operates modulation-agnostically across various digital modulation orders has not yet been established. This article presents the first attempt at such an approach by proposing a universal joint source-channel coding (uJSCC) system that utilizes a single-model encoder-decoder pair and trained vector quantization (VQ) codebooks. To support various modulation orders within a single model, the operation of every neural network (NN)-based module in the uJSCC system requires the selection of modulation orders according to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boundaries. To address the challenge of unequal output statistics from shared parameters across NN layers, we integrate multiple batch normalization (BN) layers, selected based on modulation order, after each NN layer. This integration occurs with minimal impact on the overall model size. Through a comprehensive series of experiments, we validate that the modulation-agnostic semantic communication framework demonstrates superiority over existing digital semantic communication approaches in terms of model complexity, communication efficiency, and task effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Can Yavuz, Yang Yang</p>
            <p>Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance. In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models. We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks. this https URL</p>

            <p>This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates an over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) system that employs fluid antennas (FAs) at an access point. The system enhances learning performance by leveraging the additional degrees of freedom provided by antenna mobility. We analyze the convergence of the OTA-FL system and derive the optimality gap to illustrate the influence of FAs on learning performance. With these results, we formulate a nonconvex optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the positions of the FAs, the beamforming vector, and the transmit power allocation at each user. To address the dynamic environment, we cast this optimization problem as a Markov decision process and propose the recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations show that the FA-assisted OTA-FL system outperforms systems with fixed-position antennas and that the RDPG algorithm surpasses the existing methods.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a tutorial on how to account for the computational time complexity overhead of signal processing in the spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of wireless waveforms. Our methodology is particularly relevant in scenarios where achieving higher SE entails a penalty in complexity, a common trade-off present in 6G candidate waveforms. We consider that SE derives from the data rate, which is impacted by time-dependent overheads. Thus, neglecting the computational complexity overhead in the SE analysis grants an unfair advantage to more computationally complex waveforms, as they require larger computational resources to meet a signal processing runtime below the symbol period. We demonstrate our points with two case studies. In the first, we refer to IEEE 802.11a-compliant baseband processors from the literature to show that their runtime significantly impacts the SE perceived by upper layers. In the second case study, we show that waveforms considered less efficient in terms of SE can outperform their more computationally expensive counterparts if provided with equivalent high-performance computational resources. Based on these cases, we believe our tutorial can address the comparative SE analysis of waveforms that operate under different computational resource constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Hsiang Lin, Jhao-Ting Lin</p>
            <p>Multispectral unmixing (MU) is critical due to the inevitable mixed pixel phenomenon caused by the limited spatial resolution of typical multispectral images in remote sensing. However, MU mathematically corresponds to the underdetermined blind source separation problem, thus highly challenging, preventing researchers from tackling it. Previous MU works all ignore the underdetermined issue, and merely consider scenarios with more bands than sources. This work attempts to resolve the underdetermined issue by further conducting the light-splitting task using a network-inspired virtual prism, and as this task is challenging, we achieve so by incorporating the very advanced quantum feature extraction techniques. We emphasize that the prism is virtual (allowing us to fix the spectral response as a simple deterministic matrix), so the virtual hyperspectral image (HSI) it generates has no need to correspond to some real hyperspectral sensor; in other words, it is good enough as long as the virtual HSI satisfies some fundamental properties of light splitting (e.g., non-negativity and continuity). With the above virtual quantum prism, we know that the virtual HSI is expected to possess some desired simplex structure. This allows us to adopt the convex geometry to unmix the spectra, followed by downsampling the pure spectra back to the multispectral domain, thereby achieving MU. Experimental evidence shows great potential of our MU algorithm, termed as prism-inspired multispectral endmember extraction (PRIME).</p>

            <h2>Certifiable Reachability Learning Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingqi Li, Donggun Lee, Jaewon Lee, Kris Shengjun Dong, Somayeh Sojoudi, Claire Tomlin</p>
            <p>We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite disturbances within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reachavoid value function, and post-learning certification. Compared to prior work, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway take-over example.</p>

            <h2>kNN Retrieval for Simple and Effective Zero-Shot Multi-speaker Text-to-Speech</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl El Hajal, Ajinkya Kulkarni, Enno Hermann, Mathew Magimai.-Doss</p>
            <p>While recent zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. Further, SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity. In this study, we introduce kNN-TTS, a simple and effective framework for zero-shot multi-speaker TTS using retrieval methods which leverage the linear relationships between SSL features. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our models, trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker only, achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that are trained on significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that kNN-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine-grained voice morphing. Demo samples are available at this https URL</p>

            <h2>NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Bang Jiang, Yansen Wang, Bao-Liang Lu, Dongsheng Li</p>
            <p>Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p>

            <h2>Wave-U-Mamba: An End-To-End Framework For High-Quality And Efficient Speech Super Resolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongjoon Lee, Chanwoo Kim</p>
            <p>Speech Super-Resolution (SSR) is a task of enhancing low-resolution speech signals by restoring missing high-frequency components. Conventional approaches typically reconstruct log-mel features, followed by a vocoder that generates high-resolution speech in the waveform domain. However, as mel features lack phase information, this can result in performance degradation during the reconstruction phase. Motivated by recent advances with Selective State Spaces Models (SSMs), we propose a method, referred to as Wave-U-Mamba that directly performs SSR in time domain. In our comparative study, including models such as WSRGlow, NU-Wave 2, and AudioSR, Wave-U-Mamba demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) across various low-resolution sampling rates, ranging from 8 to 24 kHz. Additionally, subjective human evaluations, scored using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) reveal that our method produces SSR with natural and human-like quality. Furthermore, Wave-U-Mamba achieves these results while generating high-resolution speech over nine times faster than baseline models on a single A100 GPU, with parameter sizes less than 2\% of those in the baseline models.</p>

            <h2>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guy Ohayon, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
            <p>Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p>

Specifically, we replace the 2D grids of the VDF with 3D grids and utilize the vehicle locations to expand the dimensions of the VDF. Then, we revise the simulation results of Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, and Fig. 15 in [1] to reaffirm the validity of the conclusions.</p>

This study investigates the frontiers of intelligent colonoscopy techniques and their prospective implications for multimodal medical applications.

This assessment enables us to identify domain-specific challenges and reveals that multimodal research in colonoscopy remains open for further exploration. To embrace the coming multimodal era, we establish three foundational initiatives: a large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset ColonINST, a colonoscopy-designed multimodal language model ColonGPT, and a multimodal benchmark.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo N. Ferreira, Marta Guimarães, Cláudia Soares</p>
            <p>The amount of debris in orbit has increased significantly over the years. With the recent growth of interest in space exploration, conjunction assessment has become a central issue. One important metric to evaluate conjunction risk is the miss distance. However, this metric does not intrinsically take into account uncertainty distributions. Some work has been developed to consider the uncertainty associated with the position of the orbiting objects, in particular, to know if these uncertainty distributions overlap (e.g., ellipsoids when considering Gaussian distributions). With this work, we present fast solutions to not only check if the ellipsoids overlap but to compute the distance between them, which we call margin. We present two fast solution methods for two different paradigms: when the best-known data from both objects can be centralized (e.g., debris-satellite conjunctions) and when the most precise covariances cannot be shared (conjunctions of satellites owned by different operators). Our methods are both accurate and fast, being able to process 15,000 conjunctions per minute with the centralized solution and approximately 490 conjunctions per minute with the distributed solution.</p>

            <p>In this article, we address aquatic environmental monitoring using a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Specifically, we develop an online path generator that provides either of circular or elliptic paths based on the real-time feedback so that the USVs efficiently sample the sensor data over given aquatic environment. To this end, we begin by formulating a novel online path generation problem for a group of Dubins vehicles in the form of cost minimization based on the formulation of persistent coverage control. We then transform the cost minimization into a constraint-based specification so that a prescribed performance level is certified. An online coverage path generator is then designed based on the so-called constraint-based control in order to meet the performance certificate together with additional constraints inherent in the parameters that specify the paths. It is also shown there that the present constraint-based approach allows one to drastically reduce the computational complexity stemming from combinations of binary variables corresponding to the turning directions of the USVs. The present coverage path generator is finally demonstrated through simulations and experiments on an original testbed of multiple USVs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton A. Stoorvogel, Ali Saberi, Zhenwei Liu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a new framework for synchronization of heterogeneous multi agent system which we refer to as weak synchronization. This new framework of synchronization is based on achieving the network stability in the absence of any information on communication network including the connectivity. Here by network stability, we mean that in the basic setup of a multi-agent system, we require that the signals exchanged over the network converge to zero. As such if the network happens to have a directed spanning tree then we obtain classical synchronization. Moreover, we design protocols which achieve weak synchronization for any network without making any kind of assumptions on communication network. If the network happens to have a directed spanning tree, then we obtain classical synchronization. However, if this is not the case then we describe in detail in this paper what kind of synchronization properties are preserved in the system and the output of the different agents can behave.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianzhe Chen, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan, Cheng-Xiang Wang, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) has attracted extensive research attention due to its potential to meet the increasingly demanding requirements of future communication systems. Meanwhile, recent researches have indicated that sparse arrays may offer promising advantages for XL-MIMO systems in the near-field. Motivated by these, this paper investigates a downlink near-field XL-MIMO communication system with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper focuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point of the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the x-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power distributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length of the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper. Furthermore, the numerical results reveals the improvement in the performance of XL-MIMO systems with the use of sparse UPAs.</p>

            <p>Event-driven sensors, which produce data only when there is a change in the input signal, are increasingly used in applications that require low-latency and low-power real-time sensing, such as robotics and edge devices. To fully achieve the latency and power advantages on offer however, similarly event-driven data processing methods are required. A promising solution is the TDE: an event-based processing element which encodes the time difference between events on different channels into an output event stream. In this work we introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to device mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is crucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same die, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate data produced by event-driven sensors.</p>

            <p>Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance.

            <h2>Calibrating Wireless AI via Meta-Learned Context-Dependent Conformal Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seonghoon Yoo, Sangwoo Park, Petar Popovski, Joonhyuk Kang, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
            <p>Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.</p>

            <p>To ensure the authenticity of navigation data, Galileo Open Service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) requires loose synchronization between the receiver clock and the system time. This means that during the period between clock calibrations, the receiver clock error needs to be smaller than a pre-defined threshold, currently up to 165s for OSNMA. On the other hand, relying on the PVT solution to steer the receiver clock or correct its bias may not be possible since this would depend on the very same signals we intend to authenticate. This work aims to investigate the causes of the frequency accuracy loss leading to clock errors and to build a model that, from the datasheet of a real-time clock (RTC) device, allows to bound the error clock during a certain period. The model's main contributors are temperature changes, long-term aging, and offset at calibration, but it includes other factors. We then apply the model to several RTCs from different manufacturers and bound the maximum error for certain periods, with a focus on the two-year between-calibration period expected for the smart tachograph, an automotive application that will integrate OSNMA.</p>

            <p>Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</p>

            <p>Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</p>

            <p>This article proposes a novel design for the Pinching Antenna SyStems (PASS) and advocates simple yet efficient wireless communications over the ``last meter''. First, the potential benefits of PASS are discussed in the paper by reviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced, including their physical principles, signal models, and communication designs. In contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept, termed \emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Based on this concept, a couple of practical transmission architectures are proposed for realizing the full potentia of PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More particularly, 1) the non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple baseband signal processing and relies on the pinching beamforming only; while 2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal processing capabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which can be further divided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based fully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put forward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further advance, by demonstrating a few numerical case studies, the significant performance gain of PASS is revealed compared to conventional multi-antenna systems. Finally, several research opportunities and open problems of PASS are highlighted.</p>

            <p>This paper is concerned with the analysis of identification errors for $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with $m$ outputs and no external inputs, using Subspace Identification Methods (SIM) with finite sample data. We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</p>

            <p>Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an essential indicator of respiratory functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$ using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on. We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$ measurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand on SpO$_2$ estimation performance.</p>

            <h2>Near-Optimal Performance of Stochastic Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sungho Shin, Sen Na, Mihai Anitescu</p>
            <p>This article presents a dynamic regret analysis for stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) in linear systems with quadratic performance index and additive and multiplicative uncertainties. Under a finite support assumption, the problem can be cast as a finite-dimensional quadratic program, but the problem becomes quickly intractable as the problem size grows exponentially in the horizon length. SMPC aims to compute approximate solutions by solving a sequence of problems with truncated prediction horizons and committing the solution in a receding-horizon fashion. While this approach is widely used in practice, its performance relative to the optimal solution is not well understood. This article reports for the first time a rigorous near-optimal performance guarantee of SMPC: Under stabilizability and detectability conditions, the dynamic regret of SMPC is exponentially small in the prediction horizon length, allowing SMPC to achieve near-optimal performance at a substantially reduced computational expense.</p>

            <h2>Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Three Refinements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingliang Duan, Wenxuan Wang, Liming Xiao, Jiaxin Gao, Shengbo Eben Li, Chang Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Bo Cheng, Keqiang Li</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex decision-making and control tasks. However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</p>

            <h2>Predictable Reinforcement Learning Dynamics through Entropy Rate Minimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Jarne Ornia, Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Jens Kober, Javier Alonso-Mora</p>
            <p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Schmid, Tomer Raviv, Nir Shlezinger, Laurent Schmalen</p>
            <p>We investigate the application of the factor graph framework for blind joint channel estimation and symbol detection on time-variant linear inter-symbol interference channels. In particular, we consider the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation, which typically suffers from high complexity as it requires the computation of the symbol-wise posterior distributions in every iteration. We address this issue by efficiently approximating the posteriors using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a suitable factor graph. By interweaving the iterations of BP and EM, the detection complexity can be further reduced to a single BP iteration per EM step. In addition, we propose a data-driven version of our algorithm that introduces momentum in the BP updates and learns a suitable EM parameter update schedule, thereby significantly improving the performance-complexity tradeoff with a few offline training samples. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed blind detector and show that it even outperforms coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</p>

            <p>Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for shaping the propagation environment, it consists of a single-layer structure within inherent limitations regarding the number of beam steering patterns. Based on the recently revolutionary technology, denoted as stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), we propose its implementation not only on the base station (BS) side in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup but also in the intermediate space between the base station and the users to adjust the environment further as needed. For the sake of convenience, we call the former BS SIM (BSIM), and the latter channel SIM (CSIM). Hence, we achieve wave-based combining at the BS and wave-based configuration at the intermediate space. Specifically, we propose a channel estimation method with reduced overhead, being crucial for SIMassisted communications. Next, we derive the uplink sum spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Notably, we optimize the phase shifts of both BSIM and CSIM simultaneously by using the projected gradient ascent method (PGAM). Compared to previous works on SIMs, we study the uplink transmission, a mMIMO setup, channel estimation in a single phase, a second SIM at the intermediate space, and simultaneous optimization of the two SIMs. Simulation results show the impact of various parameters on the sum SE, and demonstrate the superiority of our optimization approach compared to the alternating optimization (AO) method.</p>

            <p>Deep learning (DL) has greatly advanced audio classification, yet the field is limited by the scarcity of large-scale benchmark datasets that have propelled progress in other domains. While AudioSet is a pivotal step to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and limited range of evaluation use cases challenge its role as the sole resource. Therefore, we introduce \texttt{BirdSet}, a large-scale benchmark dataset for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. \texttt{BirdSet} surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours~($\uparrow\!17\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes~($\uparrow\!18\times$) for training and more than 400 hours~($\uparrow\!7\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluation use cases in audio classification. We host our dataset on Hugging Face for easy accessibility and offer an extensive codebase to reproduce our results.</p>

            <p>We introduce Self-Monitored Inference-Time INtervention (SMITIN), an approach for controlling an autoregressive generative music transformer using classifier probes. These simple logistic regression probes are trained on the output of each attention head in the transformer using a small dataset of audio examples both exhibiting and missing a specific musical trait (e.g., the presence/absence of drums, or real/synthetic music). We then steer the attention heads in the probe direction, ensuring the generative model output captures the desired musical trait. Additionally, we monitor the probe output to avoid adding an excessive amount of intervention into the autoregressive generation, which could lead to temporally incoherent music. We validate our results objectively and subjectively for both audio continuation and text-to-music applications, demonstrating the ability to add controls to large generative models for which retraining or even fine-tuning is impractical for most musicians. Audio samples of the proposed intervention approach are available on our demo page this http URL .</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liangzhi Wang, Chen Chen, Jie Zhang, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>This paper considers a downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network in which multiple multi-antenna access points (APs) serve multiple users via coherent joint transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each AP selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each AP, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the APs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</p>

            <p>Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. However, existing methods of evaluating their robustness are often limited to cross-referencing with existing literature, which is a subjective and inconsistent process. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques (specifically, feature attributors) have been applied to fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with an emphasis on evaluating the robustness of potential biomarkers produced for psychiatric disorders. Then, 65 studies using GNNs that reported potential fMRI biomarkers for psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) published before 9 October 2024 were identified from 2 online databases (Scopus, PubMed). We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies (as determined by feature attribution scores) vary greatly across studies on the same disorder. Reproducibility of biomarkers is only limited to a small subset at the level of regions and few transdiagnostic biomarkers were identified. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders via GNNs.</p>

            <h2>Optimal compressed sensing for image reconstruction with diffusion probabilistic models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Qi Zhang, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P. Simoncelli, David H. Brainard</p>
            <p>We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (generally known as a "diffusion model"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakhar Godara, Tilman Diego Aléman, Angela J. Yu</p>
            <p>\textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel method for emulating piano sounds. We propose to exploit the sines, transient, and noise decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer replicating piano notes. Three sub-modules learn these components from piano recordings and generate the corresponding harmonic, transient, and noise signals. Splitting the emulation into three independently trainable models reduces the modeling tasks' complexity. The quasi-harmonic content is produced using a differentiable sinusoidal model guided by physics-derived formulas, whose parameters are automatically estimated from audio recordings. The noise sub-module uses a learnable time-varying filter, and the transients are generated using a deep convolutional network. From singular notes, we emulate the coupling between different keys in trichords with a convolutional-based network. Results show the model matches the partial distribution of the target while predicting the energy in the higher part of the spectrum presents more challenges. The energy distribution in the spectra of the transient and noise components is accurate overall. While the model is more computationally and memory efficient, perceptual tests reveal limitations in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes. Despite this, it generally achieves perceptual accuracy in emulating single notes and trichords.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</p>

            <p>Developing generative models to create or conditionally create symbolic music presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To address these challenges, we introduce an efficient Fine-Grained Guidance (FGG) approach within diffusion models. FGG guides the diffusion models to generate music that aligns more closely with the control and intent of expert composers, which is critical to improve the accuracy, listenability, and quality of generated music. This approach empowers diffusion models to excel in advanced applications such as improvisation, and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effects of the FGG approach. We provide numerical experiments and subjective evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We have published a demo page to showcase performances, as one of the first in the symbolic music literature's demo pages that enables real-time interactive generation.</p>

We evaluate six machine learning (ML) classifiers - support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost - using grid search for feasible hyperparameters of selected classifiers and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classifier-feature subset combinations for each classifier type are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data. Our approach achieves outstanding performance, reaching 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectivelly. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data. This advancement demonstrates significant potential for clinical deployment of ML methods, offering a valuable supportive tool for an objective examination of voice pathologies.

            <p>Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p>

This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework constructed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery.

Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The Lightweight-Shared (LS) module is designed as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5\% and 67.6\% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters.

            <p>In this paper, we present a novel approach for segmenting pediatric brain tumors using a deep learning architecture, inspired by expert radiologists' segmentation strategies. Our model delineates four distinct tumor labels and is benchmarked on a held-out PED BraTS 2024 test set (i.e., pediatric brain tumor datasets introduced by BraTS). Furthermore, we evaluate our model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model using a new external dataset of 30 patients from CBTN (Children's Brain Tumor Network), labeled in accordance with the PED BraTS 2024 guidelines and 2023 BraTS Adult Glioma dataset. We compare segmentation outcomes with the winning algorithm from the PED BraTS 2023 challenge as the SOTA model. Our proposed algorithm achieved an average Dice score of 0.642 and an HD95 of 73.0 mm on the CBTN test data, outperforming the SOTA model, which achieved a Dice score of 0.626 and an HD95 of 84.0 mm. Moreover, our model exhibits strong generalizability, attaining a 0.877 Dice score in whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma dataset, surpassing existing SOTA.

            <p>Sequentially solving similar optimization problems under strict runtime constraints is essential for many applications, such as robot control, autonomous driving, and portfolio management. The performance of local optimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution: poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose learning to predict \emph{multiple} diverse initial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We introduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a single-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen using a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where several optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a different solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by including a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final output is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization. We validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole, reacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and iLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all evaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number of initial solutions required.

            <p>The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment of third-party applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, may result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven method for reconstructing and labeling conflict graphs in O-RAN. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, parameters, and KPIs. Our numerical results, based on a conflict model used in the O-RAN conflict management literature, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct conflict graphs and identify the conflicts defined by the O-RAN Alliance.</p>

It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p>

            <h2>Multiple testing in multi-stream sequential change detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjit Dandapanthula, Aaditya Ramdas</p>
            <p>Multi-stream sequential change detection involves simultaneously monitoring many streams of data and trying to detect when their distributions change, if at all. Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from detecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite average run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate (FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), per-family error rate (PFER), and global error rate (GER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is fundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL (which is typically necessary in order to have a small detection delay). One of our contributions is to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over patience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector framework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the recent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove that these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general dependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we prove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times and provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally, if finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the worst-case Type I error.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zenon Lamprou, Yashar Moshfeghi</p>
            <p>Brain decoding has emerged as a rapidly advancing and extensively utilized technique within neuroscience. This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</p>

            <h2>Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Kruspe</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wonjun Lee, Solee Im, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Jungseul Ok, Gary Geunbae Lee</p>
            <p>Dysarthric speech recognition often suffers from performance degradation due to the intrinsic diversity of dysarthric severity and extrinsic disparity from normal speech. To bridge these gaps, we propose a Dynamic Phoneme-level Contrastive Learning (DyPCL) method, which leads to obtaining invariant representations across diverse speakers. We decompose the speech utterance into phoneme segments for phoneme-level contrastive learning, leveraging dynamic connectionist temporal classification alignment. Unlike prior studies focusing on utterance-level embeddings, our granular learning allows discrimination of subtle parts of speech. In addition, we introduce dynamic curriculum learning, which progressively transitions from easy negative samples to difficult-to-distinguishable negative samples based on phonetic similarity of phoneme. Our approach to training by difficulty levels alleviates the inherent variability of speakers, better identifying challenging speeches. Evaluated on the UASpeech dataset, DyPCL outperforms baseline models, achieving an average 22.10\% relative reduction in word error rate (WER) across the overall dysarthria group.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Wagner, Alexander Churchill, Siddharth Sigtia, Erik Marchi</p>
            <p>In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Bidding Curves for Renewable Energy in Two-Settlement Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongwei Zhao, Stefanos Delikaraogloub, Vladimir Dvorkin Alberto J. Lamadrid L., Audun Botterud</p>
            <p>Coordination of day-ahead and real-time electricity markets is imperative for cost-effective electricity supply and also to provide efficient incentives for the energy transition. Although stochastic market designs feature the least-cost coordination, they are incompatible with current deterministic markets. This paper proposes a new approach for compatible coordination in two-settlement markets based on benchmark bidding curves for variable renewable energy. These curves are optimized based on a bilevel optimization problem, anticipating per-scenario responses of deterministic market-clearing problems and ultimately minimizing the expected cost across day-ahead and real-time markets. Although the general bilevel model is challenging to solve, we theoretically prove that a single-segment bidding curve with a zero bidding price is sufficient to achieve system optimality if the marginal cost of variable renewable energy is zero, thus addressing the computational challenge. In practice, variable renewable energy producers can be allowed to bid multi-segment curves with non-zero prices. We test the bilevel framework for both single- and multiple-segment bidding curves under the assumption of fixed bidding prices. We leverage duality theory and McCormick envelopes to derive the linear programming approximation of the bilevel problem, which scales to practical systems such as a 1576-bus NYISO system. We benchmark the proposed coordination and find absolute dominance over the baseline solution, which assumes that renewables agnostically bid their expected forecasts. We also demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides a good approximation of the least-cost, yet unattainable in practice, stochastic market outcome.</p>

            <p>The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</p>

            <h2>UAV-Assisted MEC Architecture for Collaborative Task Offloading in Urban IoT Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhrajit Barick, Chetna Singhal</p>
            <p>Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to meet the increasing demands and computing limitations of complex Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, implementing MEC in urban environments can be challenging due to factors like high device density, complex infrastructure, and limited network coverage. Network congestion and connectivity issues can adversely affect user satisfaction. Hence, in this article, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted collaborative MEC architecture to facilitate task offloading of IoT devices in urban environments. We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs and ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also maximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as joint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem. Due to NP-hard nature, we break the problem into two subproblems: offload strategy optimization and UAV topology optimization. We develop a Three-sided Matching with Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find stable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We also propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number of UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed task offloading scheme over benchmark schemes through simulation-based evaluation. The proposed scheme outperforms by 19%, 12%, and 25% on average in terms of percentage of served IoTs, average user satisfaction, and SP profit, respectively, with 25% lesser UAVs, making it an effective solution to support IoT task requirements in urban environments using UAV-assisted MEC architecture.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the environmental impacts linked to hazardous emissions from gas turbines, with a specific focus on employing various machine learning (ML) models to predict the emissions of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) as part of a Predictive Emission Monitoring System (PEMS). We employ a comprehensive approach using multiple predictive models to offer insights on enhancing regulatory compliance and optimizing operational parameters to reduce environmental effects effectively. Our investigation explores a range of machine learning models including linear models, ensemble methods, and neural networks. The models we assess include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This analysis provides a comparative overview of the performance of these ML models in estimating CO and NOx emissions from gas turbines, aiming to highlight the most effective techniques for this critical task. Accurate ML models for predicting gas turbine emissions help reduce environmental impact by enabling real-time adjustments and supporting effective emission control strategies, thus promoting sustainability.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Task Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Chen, Emil Björnson, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>Wireless devices are expected to provide a wide range of AI services in 6G networks. The increasing computing capabilities of wireless devices and the surge of wireless data motivate the use of privacy-preserving federated learning (FL). In contrast to centralized learning that requires sending large amounts of raw data during uplink transmission, only local model parameters are uploaded in FL. Meanwhile, over-the-air (OtA) computation is considered as a communication-efficient solution for fast FL model aggregation by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multi-access channels. The required communication resources in OtA FL do not scale with the number of FL devices. However, OtA FL is significantly affected by the uneven signal attenuation experienced by different FL devices. Moreover, the coexistence of multiple FL groups with different FL tasks brings about inter-group interference. These challenges cannot be well addressed by conventional cellular network architectures. Recently, Cell-free Massive MIMO (mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology to provide uniform coverage and high rates via joint coherent transmission. In this paper, we investigate multi-task OtA FL in Cell-free mMIMO systems. We propose optimal designs of transmit coefficients and receive combining at different levels of cooperation among the access points, aiming to minimize the sum of OtA model aggregation errors across all FL groups. Numerical results demonstrate that Cell-free mMIMO significantly outperforms conventional Cellular mMIMO in term of the FL convergence performance by operating at appropriate cooperation levels.</p>

            <p>Unpredictable weather patterns and a lack of timely, accurate information significantly challenge farmers in Uganda, leading to poor crop management, reduced yields, and heightened vulnerability to environmental stress. This research presents a framework for IoT-enabled smart agriculture, leveraging Raspberry Pi-based technology to provide real-time monitoring of weather and environmental conditions. The framework integrates sensors for temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and pressure, connected via an MCP3208 analog-to-digital converter. Data is displayed on an LCD for immediate feedback and transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for centralized storage, analysis, and remote access through a mobile app or web interface. Farmers can leverage this framework to optimize irrigation schedules and improve crop productivity through actionable insights derived from real-time and forecasted data on rainfall, temperature, pressure and soil moisture. Additionally, the system incorporates predictive weather forecasting to dynamically control sensor activity, reducing energy consumption and extending sensor lifespan. Simulated using Proteus, the proposed framework demonstrates significant potential to mitigate the impacts of unpredictable weather by reducing water consumption, improving forecasting accuracy, and boosting productivity.</p>

            <p>Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of renewable energy due to their unique advantages over traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). However, traditional VAWTs including Darrieus and Savonius types suffer from significant drawbacks -- negative torque regions exist during rotation. In this work, we propose a new design of VAWT, which combines design principles from both Darrieus and Savonius but addresses their inherent defects. The performance of the proposed VAWT is evaluated through numerical simulations and validated by experimental testing. The results demonstrate that its power output is approximately three times greater than that of traditional Savonius VAWTs of comparable size. The performance of the proposed VAWT is further optimized using machine learning techniques, including Gaussian process regression and neural networks, based on extensive supercomputer simulations. This optimization leads to a 30% increase in power output.</p>

            <h2>Impedance Trajectory Analysis during Power Swing for Grid-Forming Inverter with Different Current Limiters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p>

            <p>This paper studies power-efficient uplink transmission design for federated learning (FL) that employs over-the-air analog aggregation and multi-antenna beamforming at the server. We jointly optimize device transmit weights and receive beamforming at each FL communication round to minimize the total device transmit power while ensuring convergence in FL training. Through our convergence analysis, we establish sufficient conditions on the aggregation error to guarantee FL training convergence. Utilizing these conditions, we reformulate the power minimization problem into a unique bi-convex structure that contains a transmit beamforming optimization subproblem and a receive beamforming feasibility subproblem. Despite this unconventional structure, we propose a novel alternating optimization approach that guarantees monotonic decrease of the objective value, to allow convergence to a partial optimum. We further consider imperfect channel state information (CSI), which requires accounting for the channel estimation errors in the power minimization problem and FL convergence analysis. We propose a CSI-error-aware joint beamforming algorithm, which can substantially outperform one that does not account for channel estimation errors. Simulation with canonical classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed methods achieve significant power reduction compared to existing benchmarks across a wide range of parameter settings, while attaining the same target accuracy under the same convergence rate.</p>

            <p>We present a method for solving a large-scale stochastic capacity expansion problem which explicitly considers reliability constraints, in particular constraints on expected energy not served. Our method tackles this problem by a Lagrange relaxation of the expected energy not served constraints. We solve the relaxed formulation in an iterative manner, using a subgradient-based method. Each iteration requires the solution of a stochastic capacity expansion problem, for which we implement a subgradient decomposition scheme in a high-performance computing infrastructure. We apply the proposed methodology on the Economic Viability Assessment model that is used by ENTSO-E in the annual European Resource Adequacy Assessment, extended to include explicit reliability constraints. The approach is able to solve this model achieving a 1.3% optimality gap. We compare our approach against accounting for reliability through penalizing load shedding at VOLL, and find that the former results in 1.6% savings in total cost. We are also able to quantify the cost savings from allowing some load curtailment in the capacity planning process, which ranges from 1.6 to 6% in the cases analyzed.</p>

            <p>We present a massively parallel solver that accelerates DC loadflow computations for power grid topology optimization tasks. Our approach leverages low-rank updates of the Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) to represent substation splits, line outages, and reconfigurations without ever refactorizing the system. Furthermore, we implement the core routines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), thereby exploiting their high-throughput architecture for linear algebra. A two-level decomposition separates changes in branch topology from changes in nodal injections, enabling additional speed-ups by an in-the-loop brute force search over injection variations at minimal additional cost. We demonstrate billion-loadflow-per-second performance on power grids of varying sizes in workload settings which are typical for gradient-free topology optimization such as Reinforcement Learning or Quality Diversity methods. While adopting the DC approximation sacrifices some accuracy and prohibits the computation of voltage magnitudes, we show that this sacrifice unlocks new scales of computational feasibility, offering a powerful tool for large-scale grid planning and operational topology optimization.</p>

            <p>The importance and cost of time-domain simulations when studying power systems have exponentially increased in the last decades. With the growing share of renewable energy sources, the slow and predictable responses from large turbines are replaced by the fast and unpredictable dynamics from power electronics. The current existing simulation tools require new solutions designed for faster dynamics. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged in power systems to accelerate such simulations. By incorporating knowledge during the up-front training, PINNs provide more accurate results over larger time steps than traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces PINNs as an alternative approximation method that seamlessly integrates with the current simulation framework. We replace a synchronous machine for a trained PINN in the IEEE 9-, 14-, and 30-bus systems and simulate several network disturbances. Including PINNs systematically boosts the simulations' accuracy, providing more accurate results for both the PINN-modeled component and the whole multi-machine system states.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose an economic nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for district heating networks (DHNs). The proposed method features prosumers, multiple producers, and storage systems, which are essential components of 4th generation DHNs.

Developing a smart energy management system to accomplish these goals requires detailed models of highly complex nonlinear systems and computational algorithms able to handle large-scale optimization problems. To address this, we introduce a graph-based optimization-oriented model that efficiently integrates distributed producers, prosumers, storage buffers, and bidirectional pipe flows, such that it can be implemented in a real-time MPC setting. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in closed-loop. Our findings demonstrate that the MPC methods achieved up to 9% cost improvement over traditional rule-based controllers while better maintaining system constraints.</p>

            <h2>A large synthetic dataset for machine learning applications in power transmission grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Gillioz, Guillaume Dubuis, Philippe Jacquod</p>
            <p>With the ongoing energy transition, power grids are evolving fast. They operate more and more often close to their technical limit, under more and more volatile conditions. Fast, essentially real-time computational approaches to evaluate their operational safety, stability and reliability are therefore highly desirable. Machine Learning methods have been advocated to solve this challenge, however they are heavy consumers of training and testing data, while historical operational data for real-world power grids are hard if not impossible to access. This manuscript presents a large synthetic dataset of power injections in an electric transmission grid model of continental Europe, and describes the algorithm developed for its generation. The method allows one to generate arbitrarily large time series from the knowledge of the grid -- the admittance of its lines as well as the location, type and capacity of its power generators -- and aggregated power consumption data, such as the national load data given by ENTSO-E. The obtained datasets are statistically validated against real-world data.</p>

            <h2>A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastien Giraud, Lola Charles, Agnes Marjorie Nakiganda, Johanna Vorwerk, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
            <p>Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. However, conventional DSA approaches are becoming intractable for future power systems, driving interest in more computationally efficient data-driven methods. Efficient dataset generation is a cornerstone of these methods. While importance and generic sampling techniques often focus on operating points near the system's security boundary, systematic methods for sampling in this region remain scarce. Furthermore, the impact of sampling near the security boundary on the performance of data-driven DSA methods has yet to be established. This paper highlights the critical role of accurately capturing security boundaries for effective security assessment. As such, we propose a novel method for generating a high number of samples close to the security boundary, considering both AC feasibility and small-signal stability. Case studies on the PGLib-OPF 39-bus and PGLib-OPF 162-bus systems demonstrate the importance of including boundary-adjacent operating points in training datasets while maintaining a balanced distribution of secure and insecure points.</p>

            <h2>Interference in Wireless Networks -- A Power Allocation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzalik Maimon, Shirley Alus, Gil Kedar</p>
            <p>Co-Channel Interference (CCI) is a fundamental problem in wireless communication networks. It is a well-studied problem in the field. As channels use the same frequency, interference in the radio waves occurs which, in turn, reduces the capacity of the interfered channels. There is a need to use the least number of frequencies as communication networks advance to 5G. In this paper, we present a novel technique to manage interference on channels. We use time division for links of the same frequency and, as a result, we show a significant reduction in the number of frequencies used overall in the network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Toshani, Janith Petangoda, Chatura Samarakoon, Phillip Stanley-Marbell</p>
            <p>Uniform temperature distribution in Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is essential for producing durable 3D prints. Achieving uniformity requires a laser power control system that minimises deviation of the printing temperatures from the target temperature. Because the estimate of the actual process temperature is an input to the laser power control, uncertainty in the estimate of the actual temperature can lead to fluctuations in laser power that affect the thermal performance of the SLS. This article investigates the sensitivity of a laser power control system to temperature measurement uncertainty. This article evaluates the effectiveness of two methods for quantifying the effect of input uncertainty on a SLS laser power control system: a recent innovation in uncertainty-tracked architecture and traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We show that recent advances in computer architecture for arithmatic on probability distributions make it possible for the first time, to perform control system uncertainty analysis with latencies under 30 ms, while achieving the same level of uncertainty analysis as Monte Carlo methods with latencies that are two orders of magnitude slower.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Effect of Long-Term Memory Model Parameters in Pole-Zero Identification for Stability Analysis of Power Amplifiers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Libe Mori, Aitziber Anakabe, Juan-Mari Collantes, Vincent Armengaud</p>
            <p>Understanding the nature of potential instabilities is indispensable for the stabilization of power amplifiers. Pole-zero identification is one of the techniques that can be used to determine the stability of a design in large-signal operation. In this work, the possible presence of poles at the fundamental frequency linked to the long-term memory parameters of the transistor's model (self-heating and traps) is presented and discussed. The paper shows how their effect on the identified frequency responses around the fundamental frequency may compromise the stability analysis results and the assessment of stability margins. The low observability of the poles at the fundamental frequency highlights the importance of an accurate identification of real poles in low-frequency bands. A specific algorithm for the automatic frequency domain identification of non-resonant frequency responses and a procedure for detecting and reducing overfitting of real poles is proposed in this article. The benefits of the proposed methodology to correctly detect and analyze real poles at low frequencies is demonstrated through Monte-Carlo sensitivity analyses of two different amplifier designs.</p>

            <h2>Federated Learning Strategies for Coordinated Beamforming in Multicell ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lai Jiang, Kaitao Meng, Murat Temiz, Jiaming Hu, Christos Masouros</p>
            <p>We propose two cooperative beamforming frameworks based on federated learning (FL) for multi-cell integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. Our objective is to address the following dilemma in multicell ISAC: 1) Beamforming strategies that rely solely on local channel information risk generating significant inter-cell interference (ICI), which degrades network performance for both communication users and sensing receivers in neighboring cells; 2) conversely centralized beamforming strategies can mitigate ICI by leveraging global channel information, but they come with substantial transmission overhead and latency that can be prohibitive for latency-sensitive and source-constrained applications. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a partially decentralized training framework motivated by the vertical federated learning (VFL) paradigm. In this framework, the participating base stations (BSs) collaboratively design beamforming matrices under the guidance of a central server. The central server aggregates local information from the BSs and provides feedback, allowing BSs to implicitly manage ICI without accessing the global channel information. To make the solution scalable for densely deployed wireless networks, we take further steps to reduce communication overhead by presenting a fully decentralized design based on the horizontal federated learning (HFL). Specifically, we develop a novel loss function to control the interference leakage power, enabling a more efficient training process by entirely eliminating local channel information exchange. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions can achieve significant performance improvements comparable to the benchmarks in terms of both communication and radar information rates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mafu Zhang, Huanghaohe Zou, Saleh Farzamkia, Zibo Chen, Chen Chen, Alex Q. Huang</p>
            <p>This paper reviews commonly used three-phase isolated AC-DC converters and introduces a novel Y-configuration Active Bridge (YAB) converter for single-stage isolated AC-DC power conversion. The proposed YAB addresses the limitations of multi-stage designs by eliminating bulky electrolytic capacitor banks and input boost inductors, thereby enabling a simplified start-up process without the risk of inrush current. It retains the advantages of single-stage AC-DC Dual Active Bridge (AC-DC DAB) converters while significantly reducing control complexity. Across its entire operating range, the YAB achieves low total harmonic distortion, maintains relatively low current stress, and exhibits excellent soft-switching performance. The operating principle of the proposed converter is detailed, and an equivalent circuit model is presented. System performance is evaluated using a numerical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) model. To validate the performance of the proposed converter, a three-phase 6 kW, 480 V YAB prototype is designed and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum efficiency of 97.1\%.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Functional RIS Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongsheng Han, Peng Wang, Wanli Ni, Wen Wang, Ailing Zheng, Dusit Niyato, Naofal Al-Dhahir</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) that supports signal reflection, refraction, amplification, and target sensing simultaneously. Our MF-RIS aims to enhance integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems, particularly in multi-user and multi-target scenarios. Equipped with reflection and refraction components (i.e., amplifiers and phase shifters), MF-RIS is able to adjust the amplitude and phase shift of both communication and sensing signals on demand. Additionally, with the assistance of sensing elements, MF-RIS is capable of capturing the echo signals from multiple targets, thereby mitigating the signal attenuation typically associated with multi-hop links. We propose a MF-RIS-enabled multi-user and multi-target ISAC system, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of sensing targets. This problem involves jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations, subject to constraints on the communication rate, total power budget, and MF-RIS coefficients. We decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three sub-problems, and then solve them via an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The performance of MF-RIS varies under different operating protocols, and energy splitting (ES) exhibits the best performance in the considered MF-RIS-enabled multi-user multi-target ISAC system; 2) Under the same total power budget, the proposed MF-RIS with ES protocol attains 52.2%, 73.5% and 60.86% sensing SINR gains over active RIS, passive RIS, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS), respectively; 3) The number of sensing elements will no longer improve sensing performance after exceeding a certain number.</p>

            <h2>A Wearable Strain-Sensor-Based Shoulder Patch for Fatigue Detection in Bicep Curls</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Xuan Chua, Shuhua Peng, Thanh Nho Do, Chun Hui Wang, Liao Wu</p>
            <p>A common challenge in home-based rehabilitation is muscle compensation induced by pain or fatigue, where patients with weakened primary muscles recruit secondary muscle groups to assist their movement, causing issues such as delayed rehabilitation progress or risk of further injury. In a home-based setting, the subtle compensatory actions may not be perceived since physiotherapists cannot directly observe patients. To address this problem, this study develops a novel wearable strain-sensor-based shoulder patch to detect fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises. Built on an observation that the amplitude of a strain sensor's resistance is correlated to the motion of a joint that the sensor is attached to, we develop an algorithm that can robustly detect the state when significant changes appear in the shoulder joint motion, which indicates fatigue-induced muscle compensation in bicep curls. The developed shoulder patch is tested on 13 subjects who perform bicep curl exercises with a 5 kg dumbell until reaching fatigue. During the experiment, the performance of the shoulder patch is also benchmarked with optical tracking sensors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Results reveal that the proposed wearable sensor and detection methods effectively monitor fatigue-induced muscle compensation during bicep curl exercises in both Real-Time and Post Hoc modes. This development marks a significant step toward enhancing the effectiveness of home-based rehabilitation by providing physiotherapists with a tool to monitor and adjust treatment plans remotely.</p>

            <h2>DER Hosting capacity for distribution networks: definitions, attributes, use-cases and challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Umar Hashmi</p>
            <p>The rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) has outpaced grid modernization, leading to capacity limitations that challenge their further integration. Hosting Capacity Assessment (HCA) is a critical tool for evaluating how much DER capacity a grid can handle without breaching operational limits. HCA serves multiple goals: enabling higher DER penetration, accelerating grid connection times, guiding infrastructure upgrades or flexible resource deployment, ensuring equitable policies, and improving grid flexibility while minimizing curtailment. HCA lacks a universal definition, varying by modelling approaches, uncertainty considerations, and objectives. This paper addresses five key questions to standardize and enhance HCA practices. First, it classifies HCA objectives associated with different stakeholders such as system operators, consumers, market operators and consumers. Second, it examines model attributes, including modelling sophistication, data requirements, and uncertainty handling, thus balancing complexity with computational efficiency. Third, it explores HCA applications, such as planning grid investments or operational decisions, and summarizes use cases associated with HCA. Fourth, it emphasizes the need for periodic updates to reflect dynamic grid conditions, evolving technologies, and new DER installations. Finally, it identifies challenges, such as ensuring data quality, managing computational demands, and aligning short-term and long-term goals. By addressing these aspects, this paper provides a structured approach to perform and apply HCA, offering insights for engineers, planners, and policymakers to manage DER integration effectively.</p>

Simulations using real-world charging transactions spanning over different categories of charging stations are performed for two flexibility products (redispatch and capacity limitations) when offered along with different business-as-usual (BAU) schedules. Results show that the variation of tradable flexibility depends mainly on the BAU schedules, the duration of the requested flexibility, and its start time. Further, the implication of these flexibility products on the average energy costs and emissions is also studied for different cases.

            <p>Due to the fundamental transition to a power electronic dominated power system, the increasing diversity of dynamic elements underscores the need to assess their similarity to mature electrical engineering models. This article addresses the concept of the Dynamic Similarity Index (DSI) for its use in, power electronics-dominated networks. The DSI is a multipurpose tool developed to be used by different stakeholders (e.g., converter manufacturers and system operators). Such an index is calculated per frequency, which serves to anticipate potential differences in particular frequency ranges of interest between the model under study and the reference model. Within the scope of this study, the dynamic similarity of inverter-based generators to an ideal voltage source behind an impedance is assessed, due to the relevance of this fundamental circuit in the representation of generation units in power system studies. The article presents two potential applications based on this mathematical framework. First, for manufacturers to evaluate control performance compared to a reference model and second, it enables operators to diagnose buses with voltage vulnerability based on a user-defined reference Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) value. The DSI results for these two case studies are validated using Matlab Simulink simulations.</p>

            <h2>One Model to Forecast Them All and in Entity Distributions Bind Them</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kutay Bölat, Simon Tindemans</p>
            <p>Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster, we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.</p>

            <h2>Discrete-Time Modeling and Handover Analysis of Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyan Wei, Hongtao Zhang</p>
            <p>Owning to the reflection gain and double path loss featured by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) channels, handover (HO) locations become irregular and the signal strength fluctuates sharply with variations in IRS connections during HO, the risk of HO failures (HOFs) is exacerbated and thus HO parameters require reconfiguration. However, existing HO models only assume monotonic negative exponential path loss and cannot obtain sound HO parameters. This paper proposes a discrete-time model to explicitly track the HO process with variations in IRS connections, where IRS connections and HO process are discretized as finite states by measurement intervals, and transitions between states are modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, to capture signal fluctuations during HO, IRS connection state-dependent distributions of the user-IRS distance are modified by the correlation between measurement intervals. In addition, states of the HO process are formed with Time-to-Trigger and HO margin whose transition probabilities are integrated concerning all IRS connection states. Trigger location distributions and probabilities of HO, HOF, and ping-pong (PP) are obtained by tracing user HO states. Results show IRSs mitigate PPs by 48% but exacerbate HOFs by 90% under regular parameters. Optimal parameters are mined ensuring probabilities of HOF and PP are both less than 0.1%.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Enhanced Mobility Through a Line-of-Sight State Transition Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyan Wei, Hongtao Zhang</p>
            <p>Rapid signal fluctuations due to blockage effects cause excessive handovers (HOs) and degrade mobility performance. By reconfiguring line-of-sight (LoS) Links through passive reflections, intelligent reflective surface (IRS) has the potential to address this issue. Due to the lack of introducing blocking effects, existing HO analyses cannot capture excessive HOs or exploit enhancements via IRSs. This paper proposes an LoS state transition model enabling analysis of mobility enhancement achieved by IRS-reconfigured LoS links, where LoS link blocking and reconfiguration utilizing IRS during user movement are explicitly modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, the condition for blocking LoS links is characterized as a set of possible blockage locations, the distribution of available IRSs is thinned by the criteria for reconfiguring LoS links. In addition, BSs potentially handed over are categorized by probabilities of LoS states to enable HO decision analysis. By projecting distinct gains of LoS states onto a uniform equivalent distance criterion, mobility enhanced by IRS is quantified through the compact expression of HO probability. Results show the probability of dropping into non-LoS due to movement decreases by 70% when deploying IRSs with the density of 93/km$^2$, and HOs decrease by 57% under the optimal IRS distributed deployment parameter.</p>

            <h2>A Synchrophasor Estimator Characterized by Attenuated Self-Interference and Robustness Against DC Offsets: the DCSOGI Interpolated DFT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> César García-Veloso, Mario Paolone, José María Maza-Ortega</p>
            <p>The second-order generalized integrator (SOGI), which can be used to attenuate the self-interference of the fundamental tone, is unable to reject DC offsets on the input signal. Consequently, the performance of any SOGI based synchrophasor estimation (SE) technique might be compromised in the presence of such DC components. The current work presents a SE algorithm which adopts and enhanced SOGI formulation, robust against DC, combined with a three-point IpDFT and a Hanning window. Two alternative formulations relying respectively on the use of two and three nominal fundamental period observation windows are proposed and assessed for simultaneous compliance with both phasor measurement unit (PMU) P and M performance classes. This is done by means of a simulated environment where all the operating conditions defined by the IEC/IEEE Std. 60255-118-1-2018 are evaluated simultaneously combined with a $10\%$ static DC and under two different noise levels. Furthermore, both formulations adopt a dedicated mechanism for the detection and correction of low amplitude $2^{nd}$ harmonic tones to ensure their compliance with the standard can be maintained in the presence of such disturbances even under off-nominal frequency conditions. Finally the resilience of both methods against multiple simultaneous harmonic interferences is also analyzed.</p>

            <p>Water infrastructures are essential for drinking water supply, irrigation, fire protection, and other critical applications. However, water pumping systems, which are key to transporting water to the point of use, consume significant amounts of energy and emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually. With the wide deployment of digital water meters and sensors in these infrastructures, Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to optimize water supply control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerability of ML methods in terms of worst-case performance raises safety concerns when deployed in critical water infrastructures. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-augmented online control algorithm, termed LAOC, designed to dynamically schedule the activation and/or speed of water pumps. To ensure safety, we introduce a novel design of safe action sets for online control problems. By leveraging these safe action sets, LAOC can provably guarantee safety constraints while utilizing ML predictions to reduce energy and environmental costs. Our analysis reveals the tradeoff between safety requirements and average energy/environmental cost performance. Additionally, we conduct an experimental study on a building water supply system to demonstrate the empirical performance of LAOC. The results indicate that LAOC can effectively reduce environmental and energy costs while guaranteeing safety constraints.</p>

            <p>Communication reliability, as defined by 3GPP, refers to the probability of providing a desired quality of service (QoS). This metric is typically quantified for wireless networks by averaging the QoS success indicator over spatial and temporal random variables. Recently, the meta distribution (MD) has emerged as a two-level performance analysis tool for wireless networks, offering a detailed examination of the outer level (i.e., system-level) reliability assessment versus the inner level (i.e., link-level) reliability thresholds. Most existing studies focus on first-order spatiotemporal MD reliability analyses, and the benefits of leveraging MD reliability for applications beyond this structure remain unexplored, a gap addressed in this paper. We present wireless application examples that can benefit the higher-order MD reliability analysis. Specifically, we provide the analysis and numerical results for a second-order spatial-spectral-temporal MD reliability of ultra-wideband THz communication. The results demonstrate the value of the hierarchical representation of MD reliability across three domains and the impact of the inner-layer target reliability on the overall MD reliability measure.</p>

            <h2>Joint Infrastructure Planning and Order Assignment for On-Demand Food-Delivery Services with Coordinated Drones and Human Couriers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Yitong Shang, Sen Li</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the optimal infrastructure planning and order assignment problem of an on-demand food-delivery platform with a mixed fleet of drones and human couriers. The platform has two delivery modes: (a) ground delivery and (b) drone-assisted delivery (i.e., air delivery). In ground delivery, couriers directly collect and transport orders from restaurants to destinations. For air delivery, the delivery process involves three legs: initially, a human courier picks up the order from the restaurant and transports it to a nearby launchpad, where personnel load the orders onto drones and replace batteries as needed. The loaded drone then transports the order from the launchpad to a kiosk, where another courier retrieves the order from the kiosk for final delivery. The platform must determine the optimal locations for launchpads and kiosks within a transportation network, and devise an order assignment strategy that allocates food-delivery orders between ground and air delivery considering the bundling probabilities of ground deliveries and the waiting times at launchpads and kiosks. We formulate the platform's problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and develop a novel neural network-assisted optimization method to obtain high-quality solutions. A case study in Hong Kong validates our model and algorithm, revealing that drone delivery reduces operational costs, minimizes courier fleet size, and increases order bundling opportunities. We also find that the expansion of air delivery services may entail larger delivery times due to the trade-off between the travel time savings induced by the faster air delivery and the associated detours incurred by intermodal transfer and extra waiting times at launchpads and kiosks, which crucially depends on the distance of the orders and the sequence of activating long-distance air delivery routes versus short-distance ones.</p>

            <h2>ElectricityEmissions.jl: A Framework for the Comparison of Carbon Intensity Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joe Gorka, Noah Rhodes, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing number of individuals, companies and organizations are interested in computing and minimizing the carbon emissions associated with their real-time electricity consumption. To achieve this, they require a carbon signal, i.e. a metric that defines the real-time carbon intensity of their electricity supply. Unfortunately, in a grid with multiple generation sources and multiple consumers, the physics of the system do not provide an unambiguous way to trace electricity from source to sink. As a result, there are a multitude of proposed carbon signals, each of which has a distinct set of properties and method of calculation. It remains unclear which signal best quantifies the carbon footprint of electricity. This paper seeks to inform the discussion about which carbon signal is better or more suitable for two important use cases, namely carbon-informed load shifting and carbon accounting. We do this by developing a new software package ElectricityEmissions$.$jl, that computes several established and newly proposed carbon emission metrics for standard electric grid test cases. We also demonstrate how the package can be used to investigate the effects of using these metrics to guide load shifting. Our results affirm previous research, which showed that the choice of carbon emission metric has significant impact on shifting results and associated carbon emission reductions. In addition, we demonstrate the impact of load shifting on both the consumers that perform the shifting and consumers that do not. Disconcertingly, we observe that shifting according to common metrics such as average carbon emissions can reduce the amount of emissions allocated to the consumer doing the shifting, while increasing the total emissions of the power system.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Withholding Behavior Analysis of Historical Energy Storage Bids in California</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neal Ma, Ningkun Zheng, Ning Qi, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of battery energy storage in wholesale electricity markets calls for a deeper understanding of storage operators' bidding strategies and their market impacts. This study examines energy storage bidding data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) between July 1, 2023, and October 1, 2024, with a primary focus on economic withholding strategies. Our analysis reveals that storage bids are closely aligned with day-ahead and real-time market clearing prices, with notable bid inflation during price spikes. Statistical tests demonstrate a strong correlation between price spikes and capacity withholding, indicating that operators can anticipate price surges and use market volatility to increase profitability. Comparisons with optimal hindsight bids further reveal a clear daily periodic bidding pattern, highlighting extensive economic withholding. These results underscore potential market inefficiencies and highlight the need for refined regulatory measures to address economic withholding as storage capacity in the market continues to grow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ildar N. Idrisov, Divine Okeke, Abdullatif Albaseer, Mohamed Abdallah, Federico M. Ibanez</p>
            <p>Modern power grids are transitioning towards power electronics-dominated grids (PEDG) due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. This shift introduces complexities in grid operation and increases vulnerability to cyberattacks. This research explores the application of digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection in PEDGs. A DT can accurately track and simulate the behavior of the physical grid in real-time, providing a platform for monitoring and analyzing grid operations, with extended amount of data about dynamic power flow along the whole power system. By integrating ML algorithms, the DT can learn normal grid behavior and effectively identify anomalies that deviate from established patterns, enabling early detection of potential cyberattacks or system faults. This approach offers a comprehensive and proactive strategy for enhancing cybersecurity and ensuring the stability and reliability of PEDGs.</p>

            <h2>Early Detection and Classification of Hidden Contingencies in Modern Power Systems: A Learning-based Stochastic Hybrid System Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erfan Mehdipour Abadi, Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel learning-based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) approach for detecting and classifying various contingencies in modern power systems. Specifically, the proposed method is capable of identifying hidden contingencies that cannot be captured by existing sensing and monitoring systems, such as failures in protection systems or line outages in distribution networks. The LSHS approach detects contingencies by analyzing system outputs and behaviors. It then categorizes them based on their impact on the SHS model into physical, control network, and measurement contingencies. The stochastic hybrid system (SHS) model is further extended into an advanced closed-loop framework incorporating both system dynamics and observer-based state estimation error dynamics. Machine learning methods within the LSHS framework are employed for contingency classification and rapid detection. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are validated through simulations on an enhanced IEEE-33 bus system. The results demonstrate that the LSHS framework significantly improves the accuracy and speed of contingency detection compared to state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising solution for enhancing power system contingency detection.</p>

            <h2>BOOST: Microgrid Sizing using Ordinal Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Fares El Hajj Chehade, Sami Karaki</p>
            <p>The transition to sustainable energy systems has highlighted the critical need for efficient sizing of renewable energy resources in microgrids. In particular, designing photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems to meet residential loads is challenging due to trade-offs between cost, reliability, and environmental impact. While previous studies have employed dynamic programming and heuristic techniques for microgrid sizing, these approaches often fail to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we propose BOOST, or Battery-solar Ordinal Optimization Sizing Technique, a novel framework for optimizing the sizing of PV and battery components in microgrids. Ordinal optimization enables computationally efficient evaluations of potential designs while preserving accuracy through robust ranking of solutions. To determine the optimal operation of the system at any given time, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach, which achieves lower costs than the commonly used dynamic programming methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework identifies optimal designs that achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as low as 8.84 cents/kWh, underscoring its potential for cost-effective microgrid design. The implications of our work are significant: BOOST provides a scalable and accurate methodology for integrating renewable energy into residential microgrids, addressing economic and environmental goals simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Hand-Crafted and Machine-Driven Histopathological Features for Prostate Cancer Classification and Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feda Bolus Al Baqain, Omar Sultan Al-Kadi</p>
            <p>Histopathological image analysis is a reliable method for prostate cancer identification. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two approaches for segmenting glandular structures in prostate images to automate Gleason grading. The first approach utilizes a hand-crafted learning technique, combining Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors to highlight spatial dependencies and minimize information loss at the pixel level. For machine driven feature extraction, we employ a U-Net convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation of prostate gland stroma tissue. Support vector machine-based learning of hand-crafted features achieves impressive classification accuracies of 99.0% and 95.1% for GLCM and LBP, respectively, while the U-Net-based machine-driven features attain 94% accuracy. Furthermore, a comparative analysis demonstrates superior segmentation quality for histopathological grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the U-Net approach, as assessed by Jaccard and Dice metrics. This work underscores the utility of machine-driven features in clinical applications that rely on automated pixel-level segmentation in prostate tissue images.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Optimize Joint Chance-constrained Power Dispatch Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meiyi Li, Javad Mohammadi</p>
            <p>The ever-increasing integration of stochastic renewable energy sources into power systems operation is making the supply-demand balance more challenging. While joint chance-constrained methods are equipped to model these complexities and uncertainties, solving these models using the traditional iterative solvers is time-consuming and can hinder real-time implementation. To overcome the shortcomings of today's solvers, we propose a fast, scalable, and explainable machine learning-based optimization proxy. Our solution, called Learning to Optimize the Optimization of Joint Chance-Constrained Problems (LOOP-JCCP), is iteration-free and solves the underlying problem in a single-shot. Our model uses a polyhedral reformulation of the original problem to manage constraint violations and ensure solution feasibility across various scenarios through customizable probability settings. To this end, we build on our recent deterministic solution (LOOP-LC 2.0) by incorporating a set aggregator module to handle uncertain sample sets of varying sizes and complexities. Our results verify the feasibility of our near-optimal solutions for joint chance-constrained power dispatch scenarios. Additionally, our feasibility guarantees increase the transparency and interpretability of our method, which is essential for operators to trust the outcomes. We showcase the effectiveness of our model in solving the stochastic energy management problem of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). Our numerical findings complement our theoretical justifications and demonstrate great flexibility in parameter tuning, adaptability to diverse datasets, and increased computational speed.</p>

            <p>Europe is warming at the fastest rate of all continents, experiencing a temperature increase of about 1°C higher than the corresponding global increase. Aiming to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Europe requires an in-depth understanding of the potential energy transition pathways. In this paper, we develop four qualitative long-term scenarios covering the European energy landscape, considering key uncertainty pillars -- categorized under social, technological, economic, political, and geopolitical aspects. First, we place the scenarios in a three-dimensional space defined by Social dynamics, Innovation, and Geopolitical instabilities. These scenarios are brought to life by defining their narratives and focus areas according to their location in this three-dimensional space. The scenarios envision diverse futures and include distinct features. The EU Trinity scenario pictures how internal divisions among EU member states, in the context of global geopolitical instability, affect the EU climate targets. The REPowerEU++ scenario outlines the steps needed for a self-sufficient, independent European energy system by 2050. The Go RES scenario examines the feasibility of achieving carbon neutrality earlier than 2050 given favourable uncertain factors. The NECP Essentials scenario extends current national energy and climate plans until 2060 to assess their role in realizing climate neutrality. The scenarios are extended by incorporating policies and economic factors and detailed in a Qualitative to Quantitative (Q2Q) matrix, linking narratives to quantification. Finally, two scenarios are quantified to illustrate the quantification process. All the scenarios are in the process of being quantified and will be openly available and reusable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Bai, Yuchao Li, Andreas A. Malikopoulos, Karl Henrik Johansson, Jonas Mårtensson</p>
            <p>In this work, we address the problem of charging coordination between electric trucks and charging stations. The problem arises from the tension between the trucks' nontrivial charging times and the stations' limited charging facilities. Our goal is to reduce the trucks' waiting times at the stations while minimizing individual trucks' operational costs. We propose a distributed coordination framework that relies on computation and communication between the stations and the trucks, and handles uncertainties in travel times and energy consumption. Within the framework, the stations assign a limited number of charging ports to trucks according to the first-come, first-served rule. In addition, each station constructs a waiting time forecast model based on its historical data and provides its estimated waiting times to trucks upon request. When approaching a station, a truck sends its arrival time and estimated arrival-time windows to the nearby station and the distant stations, respectively. The truck then receives the estimated waiting times from these stations in response, and updates its charging plan accordingly while accounting for travel uncertainties. We performed simulation studies for $1,000$ trucks traversing the Swedish road network for $40$ days, using realistic traffic data with travel uncertainties. The results show that our method reduces the average waiting time of the trucks by $46.1\%$ compared to offline charging plans computed by the trucks without coordination and update, and by $33.8\%$ compared to the coordination scheme assuming zero waiting times at distant stations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elina Spyrou, Qiwei Zhang, Robin B. Hytowitz, Ben F. Hobbs, Siddharth Tyagi, Mengmeng Cai, Michael Blonsky</p>
            <p>The presence of variable renewable energy resources with uncertain outputs in day-ahead electricity markets results in additional balancing needs in real-time. Addressing those needs cost-effectively and reliably within a competitive market with unbundled products is challenging as both the demand for and the availability of flexibility depends on day-ahead energy schedules. Existing approaches for reserve procurement usually rely either on oversimplified demand curves that do not consider how system conditions that particular day affect the value of flexibility, or on bilateral trading of hedging instruments that are not co-optimized with day-ahead schedules. This article proposes a new product, `Flexibility Options', to address these two limitations. The demand for this product is endogenously determined in the day-ahead market and it is met cost-effectively by considering real-time supply curves for product providers, which are co-optimized with the energy supply. As we illustrate with numerical examples and mathematical analysis, the product addresses the hedging needs of participants with imbalances cost-effectively, provides a less intermittent revenue stream for participants with flexible outputs, promotes value-driven pricing of flexibility, and ensures that the system operator is revenue-neutral. This article provides a comprehensive design that can be further tested and applied in large-scale systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marena Trujillo, Amir Sajadi, Bri-Mathias Hodge</p>
            <p>Low-order frequency response models for power systems have a decades-long history in optimization and control problems such as unit commitment, economic dispatch, and wide-area control. With a few exceptions, these models are built upon the Newtonian mechanics of synchronous generators, assuming that the frequency dynamics across a system are approximately homogeneous, and assume the dynamics of nodal voltages for most operating conditions are negligible, and thus are not directly computed at all buses. As a result, the use of system frequency models results in the systematic underestimation of frequency minimum nadir and maximum RoCoF, and provides no insight into the reactive power-voltage dynamics. This paper proposes a low-order model of both frequency and voltage response in grid-forming inverter-dominated power systems. The proposed model accounts for spatial-temporal variations in frequency and voltage behavior across a system and as a result, demonstrates the heterogeneity of frequency response in future renewable power systems. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to validate the utility, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these models, setting the basis for them to serve as fast, scalable alternatives to EMT simulation, especially when dealing with very large-scale systems, for both planning and operational studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiarui Yu, Jicheng Shi, Wenjie Xu, Colin N. Jones</p>
            <p>Model predictive control (MPC) controller is considered for temperature management in buildings but its performance heavily depends on hyperparameters. Consequently, MPC necessitates meticulous hyperparameter tuning to attain optimal performance under diverse contracts. However, conventional building controller design is an open-loop process without critical hyperparameter optimization, often leading to suboptimal performance due to unexpected environmental disturbances and modeling errors. Furthermore, these hyperparameters are not adapted to different pricing schemes and may lead to non-economic operations. To address these issues, we propose an efficient performance-oriented building MPC controller tuning method based on a cutting-edge efficient constrained Bayesian optimization algorithm, CONFIG, with global optimality guarantees. We demonstrate that this technique can be applied to efficiently deal with real-world DSM program selection problems under customized black-box constraints and objectives. In this study, a simple MPC controller, which offers the advantages of reduced commissioning costs, enhanced computational efficiency, was optimized to perform on a comparable level to a delicately designed and computationally expensive MPC controller. The results also indicate that with an optimized simple MPC, the monthly electricity cost of a household can be reduced by up to 26.90% compared with the cost when controlled by a basic rule-based controller under the same constraints. Then we compared 12 real electricity contracts in Belgium for a household family with customized black-box occupant comfort constraints. The results indicate a monthly electricity bill saving up to 20.18% when the most economic contract is compared with the worst one, which again illustrates the significance of choosing a proper electricity contract.</p>

Key parameters assessed include horizontal and vertical distances (head), volume, and the total storage capacity of each reservoir, measured in GWh. By analyzing these factors, the tool determines the suitability of various lakes and dams for hydroelectric power generation, and other uses based on the horizontal and vertical threshold distances. Its robust assessment framework integrates these metrics to comprehensively evaluate each site's potential.

            <p>Power distribution systems (PDS) serve as the backbone of our modern society, ensuring electricity reaches homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. However, the increasing digitization and interconnectivity of these systems have exposed them to cyber threats. This study presents a comprehensive approach to evaluate and enhance the resilience of PDS under cyber attacks using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and complex network parameters. By systematically assessing vulnerabilities and computing resilience once critical CVSS thresholds are reached, this work identifies key resilience metrics including the critical loads service requirements. The proposed methodology improves system resilience through strategic tie-line switching, which is validated on the modified IEEE 33-bus system. Four case studies are conducted, illustrating the performance of the proposed methodology under various cyber attack scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in quantifying and enhancing resilience, offering a valuable tool for PDS operators to mitigate risks and ensure continuous service delivery to critical loads during the exploitation of cyber threats.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. D. Gomez Anccas, C. A. Hans, D. Schulz</p>
            <p>The microgrid concept offers high flexibility and resilience due to the possibility of switching between grid-connected and stand-alone operation. This renders microgrids an auspicious solution for rural areas and critical infrastructure. In standalone or islanded mode, the main objective is cost minimization while ensuring a safe and reliable operation. Optimal operation schemes for microgrids usually assume fixed power limits for energy storage units. This, however, is not sufficient for lithiumion energy storage systems, which often come with dynamic power limits that depend on the state of charge. These limits are especially prominent when the state of charge is close to its boundaries. In this paper, dynamic constraints for energy storages are modelled using convex polytopes and fitted to experimental data acquired from an 11.6 kWh lithium-ion energy storage system. The polytopic constraints are integrated in a model predictive control scheme that was designed for a standalone microgrid composed of a fuel cell, a photovoltaic generator and a lithium-ion energy storage system. To evaluate the advantages, a case study with two configurations is performed. The model predictive controller without polytopic constraints led to constraint violations in 11.77 % of the simulation time steps with a maximum deviation of 118 % above the power limits. The configuration with polytopic constraints in contrary led to no violations over the entire simulation horizon.</p>

            <p>Dataflow Model of Computation and Communications (DF MoCCs) is a formalism used to specify the behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). DF MoCCs are widely used in the design of CPSs, as they provide a high-level of abstraction to specify the system's behavior. DF MoCCs rules give semantics to a dataflow specification of a CPS, and static analysis algorithms rely on these semantics to guarantee safety properties of the dataflow specification, such as bounded memory usage and deadlock freeness. A wide range of DF MoCCs exists, each with its own characteristics and static analyses. This paper presents a survey of those DF MoCCs and a classification in eight categories. In addition, DF MoCCs are characterized by a comprehensive list of features and static analyses, which reflect their expressiveness and analyzability. Based on this characterization, a framework is proposed to compare the expressiveness and the analyzability of DF MoCCs quantitatively.</p>

In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</p>

            <h2>Greening the Grid: Electricity Market Clearing with Consumer-Based Carbon Cost</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Line Roald</p>
            <p>To enhance decarbonization efforts in electric power systems, we propose a novel electricity market clearing model that internalizes the allocation of emissions from generations to loads and allows for consideration of consumer-side carbon costs. Specifically, consumers can not only bid for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. These carbon costs provide consumers, ranging from carbon-agnostic to carbon-sensitive, with a tool to actively manage their roles in carbon emission mitigation. By incorporating carbon allocation and consumer-side carbon costs, the market clearing is influenced not solely by production and demand dynamics but also by the allocation of carbon emission responsibilities. To demonstrate the effect of our proposed model, we conduct a case study comparing market clearing outcomes across various percentages of carbon-sensitive consumers with differing carbon costs.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Probabilistic Assessment of Power System Resilience Using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion Method with Enhanced Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aidan Gerkis, Xiaozhe Wang</p>
            <p>Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events motivates the assessment of power system resilience. The random nature of these events and the resulting failures mandates probabilistic resilience assessment, but state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation) are computationally inefficient. This paper leverages the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method to efficiently quantify uncertainty in power system resilience. To address repeatability issues arising from PCE computation with different sample sets, we propose the integration of the Maximin-LHS experiment design method with the PCE method. Numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system illustrate the improved repeatability and convergence of the proposed method. The enhanced PCE method is then used to assess the resilience of the system and propose adaptation measures to improve it.</p>

            <p>Lifecycle management of power converters continues to thrive with emerging artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, yet AI mathematical explainability remains unexplored in power electronics (PE) community. The lack of theoretical rigor challenges adoption in mission-critical applications. Therefore, this letter proposes a generic framework to evaluate mathematical explainability, highlighting inference stability and training convergence from a Lipschitz continuity perspective. Inference stability governs consistent outputs under input perturbations, essential for robust real-time control and fault diagnosis. Training convergence guarantees stable learning dynamics, facilitating accurate modeling in PE contexts. Additionally, a Lipschitz-aware learning rate selection strategy is introduced to accelerate convergence while mitigating overshoots and oscillations. The feasibility of the proposed Lipschitz-oriented framework is demonstrated by validating the mathematical explainability of a state-of-the-art physics-in-architecture neural network, and substantiated through empirical case studies on dual-active-bridge converters.

We compare load steering based on peak load-reduction using the profile steering method, and load steering based on market price signals, in terms of peak loads, losses, and device profiles. We found that there are significant differences between the two methods; the peak-load reduction control strategies contribute to reducing peak power and improving power flow stability, while strategies primarily based on prices result in higher peaks and increased grid losses. Our results highlight the need to potentially move away from market-price-based DSM to DSM incentivization and control strategies that are based on peak load reductions and other system requirements.</p>

            <p>Benefiting from its capability to generalize existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures and provide additional design flexibility via interactions between RIS elements, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has attracted considerable research interests recently. However, due to the symmetric and unitary passive beamforming constraint imposed on BD-RIS, existing joint active and passive beamforming optimization algorithms for BD-RIS either exhibit high computational complexity to achieve near optimal solutions or rely on heuristic algorithms with substantial performance loss. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an efficient optimization framework for BD-RIS assisted multi-user multi-antenna communication networks. Specifically, we solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem by introducing a novel beamforming optimization algorithm that alternately optimizes active and passive beamforming matrices using iterative closed-form solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity while ensuring a sub-optimal solution.</p>

Extensive measurements were conducted to establish a detailed energy profile, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent optimizations and future node iterations. To minimize the energy consumption, multiple optimizations were implemented at both the software and hardware levels, achieving a reduction of over 60% in total energy usage through software modifications alone. Further improvements were realized by optimizing the E-ink display driving waveform and implementing a very low-power mode for non-communication activities. Based on the measured data, three measurement-based energy consumption models were developed to characterize the energy behavior of the node under: (i) normal, unoptimized operation, (ii) low-power, software-optimized operation, and (iii) very low-power, hardware-optimized operation. These models, validated with new measurement data, achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, confirming their reliability for predicting energy consumption in diverse configurations.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses how to handle slice resources for 6G networks at different time scales in an architecture based on an open radio access network (ORAN). The proposed solution includes artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge of the network and applies two control-level loops to obtain optimal performance compared to other techniques. The ORAN facilitates programmable network architectures to support such multi-time scale management using AI approaches. The proposed algorithms analyze the maximum utilization of resources from slice performance to take decisions at the inter-slice level. Inter-slice intelligent agents work at a non-real-time level to reconfigure resources within various slices. Further than meeting the slice requirements, the intra-slice objective must also include the minimization of maximum resource utilization. This enables smart utilization of the resources within each slice without affecting slice performance. Here, each xApp that is an intra-slice agent aims at meeting the optimal quality of service (QoS) of the users, but at the same time, some inter-slice objectives should be included to coordinate intra- and inter-slice agents. This is done without penalizing the main intra-slice objective. All intelligent agents use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to meet their objectives. We have presented results for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC), and massive machine type communication (mMTC) slice categories.</p>

            <h2>A Systematic Study of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Robust Autonomous Highway Ramp Entry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Larry Schester, Luis E. Ortiz</p>
            <p>Vehicles today can drive themselves on highways and driverless robotaxis operate in major cities, with more sophisticated levels of autonomous driving expected to be available and become more common in the future. Yet, technically speaking, so-called "Level 5" (L5) operation, corresponding to full autonomy, has not been achieved. For that to happen, functions such as fully autonomous highway ramp entry must be available, and provide provably safe, and reliably robust behavior to enable full autonomy. We present a systematic study of a highway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to minimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging (ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to this problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with simulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal position during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends existing work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents) and does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic and ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established that collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully decentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that controllers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against idealized optimal controllers.</p>

            <p>The techniques to design control Lyapunov functions (CLF), along with a proper stabilizing feedback, possibly in the presence of constraints, often provide control laws that are too complex for proper implementation online, especially when an optimization problem is involved. In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then a SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.</p>

            <p>Efficient spectrum allocation has become crucial as the surge in wireless-connected devices demands seamless support for more users and applications, a trend expected to grow with 6G. Innovations in satellite technologies such as SpaceX's Starlink have enabled non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) to work alongside terrestrial networks (TNs) and allocate spectrum based on regional demands. Existing spectrum sharing approaches in TNs use machine learning for interference minimization through power allocation and spectrum sensing, but the unique characteristics of NTNs like varying orbital dynamics and coverage patterns require more sophisticated coordination mechanisms. The proposed work uses a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach for efficient spectrum allocation across TN-NTN networks. DRL agents are present at each TN-NTN hierarchy that dynamically learn and allocate spectrum based on regional trends. This framework is 50x faster than the exhaustive search algorithm while achieving 95\% of optimum spectral efficiency. Moreover, it is 3.75x faster than multi-agent DRL, which is commonly used for spectrum sharing, and has a 12\% higher overall average throughput.</p>

However, the impact of these elements on Open RAN's power consumption remains heavily unexplored. This work for the first time evaluates the impact of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring on RIC's power consumption using real traffic and power measurements. By analyzing various RIC-RAN communication scenarios, we identify that RIC's power consumption can become a scalability bottleneck, particularly in large-scale deployments, even when RIC is limited to its core operational functionalities and without incorporating application-specific processes. In this context, also for the first time we explore potential power savings through the elimination of redundant KPI transmissions, extending existing techniques for identical subscription removal and KPI selection, achieving significant power consumption gains exceeding 87\% of the overall RIC power consumption.</p>

            <p>Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. However, conventional DSA approaches are becoming intractable for future power systems, driving interest in more computationally efficient data-driven methods. Efficient dataset generation is a cornerstone of these methods. While importance and generic sampling techniques often focus on operating points near the system's security boundary, systematic methods for sampling in this region remain scarce. Furthermore, the impact of sampling near the security boundary on the performance of data-driven DSA methods has yet to be established. This paper highlights the critical role of accurately capturing security boundaries for effective security assessment. As such, we propose a novel method for generating a high number of samples close to the security boundary, considering both AC feasibility and small-signal stability. Case studies on the PGLib-OPF 39-bus and PGLib-OPF 162-bus systems demonstrate the importance of including boundary-adjacent operating points in training datasets while maintaining a balanced distribution of secure and insecure points.</p>

            <p>The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</p>

            <p>Graph partitioning has many applications in powersystems from decentralized state estimation to parallel simulation. Focusing on parallel simulation, optimal grid partitioning minimizes the idle time caused by different simulation times for the sub-networks and their components and reduces the overhead required to simulate the cuts. Partitioning a graph into two parts such that, for example, the cut is minimal and the subgraphs have equal size is an NP-hard problem. In this paper we show how optimal partitioning of a graph can be obtained using quantum annealing (QA). We show how to map the requirements for optimal splitting to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and test the proposed formulation using a current D-Wave QPU. We show that the necessity to find an embedding of the QUBO on current D-Wave QPUs limits the problem size to under 200 buses and notably affects the time-to-solution. We finally discuss the implications on near-term implementation of QA in combination to traditional CPU or GPU based simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Mehdi Rakhtala, Roja Eini</p>
            <p>In this paper, a nonlinear six order model is proposed for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as a control-oriented electrochemical model. Its validation is performed on a specific single cell PEMFC with effective dimension of 5 cm5 cm. This model is described in the nonlinear state space form with 6 state variables. Load current and DC voltage are considered as measurable disturbance and control input respectively. Besides, the model includes fuel cell stack and its auxiliary components as well. In this survey, a nonlinear state space representation is derived by arranging nonlinear equations and combining them with auxiliary components model. The proposed model can be successfully used to design nonlinear controller and nonlinear observer systems. The analyzed PEMFC system consists of air compressor motor dynamic equations, air and fuel supply subsystems, a perfect air humidifier and a fuel cell stack. An experimentally validated nonlinear model that reproduces the most typical features of a laboratory PEMFC system is presented. This model is derived based on physics law in stack, including system gases dynamics. The objective of this paper is to introduce a fully analytical model which has been fully validated on a fuel cell system and its auxiliary components. The proposed method can be used as a general modeling guideline for control-oriented purposes. Moreover, it can be successfully implemented in composing a dynamic subsystem, like hydrogen subsystem, as part of the whole nonlinear model.</p>

            <h2>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Generating Synthetic Unbalanced Power Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique O. Caetano, Rahul K. Gupta, Marco Aiello, Carlos Dias Maciel</p>
            <p>The real-world data of power networks is often inaccessible due to privacy and security concerns, highlighting the need for tools to generate realistic synthetic network data. Existing methods leverage geographic tools like OpenStreetMap with heuristic rules to model system topology and typically focus on single-phase, balanced systems, limiting their applicability to real-world distribution systems, which are usually unbalanced. This work proposes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) to generate unbalanced three-phase distribution systems learning from existing networks. The scheme takes as input the base topology and aggregated demand per node and outputs a three-phase unbalanced system. The proposed scheme achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than $8\%$ across all phases, with computation times of 20.4 seconds for model training and 3.1 seconds per sample generation. The tool is applied to learn from publicly available SMART-DS dataset and applied to generate European 906 and IEEE-123 systems. We demonstrate the transfer learning capability of the proposed tool by leveraging a model trained on an observed system to generate a synthetic network for an unobserved system. Specifically, the tool is trained using the publicly available SMART-DS dataset and subsequently applied to generate synthetic networks for the European 906-bus system and the IEEE 123-bus system. This tool allows researchers to simulate realistic unbalanced three-phase power data with high accuracy and speed, enhancing planning and operational analysis for modern power grids.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Stability and Optimality: Control Strategy for a Wind Turbine Supplying an Electrolyzer in the Islanded Storage-less Microgrid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bosen Yang, Kang Ma, Jin Lin, Mingjun Zhang, QiweiDuan, Zhendong Ji, Zhi Liu, Yonghua Song</p>
            <p>Wind power generation supplying electrolyzers in islanded microgrids is an essential technical pathway for green hydrogen production, attracting growing attention in the transition towards net zero carbon emissions. Both academia and industry widely recognize that islanded AC microgrids normally rely on battery energy storage systems (BESSs) for grid-forming functions. However, the high cost of BESS significantly increases the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), compromising economic feasibility. To address this challenge and reduce the LCOH, this paper focuses on a wind turbine (WT) supplying an electrolyzer in a storage-less microgrid and identifies a unique characteristic that challenges the conventional understanding of this microgrid: active power is coupled with microgrid voltage rather than frequency, the latter being entirely decoupled from active power balance. Based on this unique characteristic, this paper develops a new control strategy that maintains power balance, stabilizes the voltage and frequency, and maximizes hydrogen production. The effectiveness of the control strategy is validated through case studies conducted in Matlab/Simulink, especially its capability to maintain stability while maximizing hydrogen production under various conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqian Wu, Bolun Xu, James Anderson</p>
            <p>We investigate the profitability and risk of energy storage arbitrage in electricity markets under price uncertainty, exploring both robust and chance-constrained optimization approaches. We analyze various uncertainty representations, including polyhedral, ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and probabilistic approximations, to model price fluctuations and construct efficient frontiers that highlight the tradeoff between risk and profit. Using historical electricity price data, we quantify the impact of uncertainty on arbitrage strategies and compare their performance under distinct market conditions. The results reveal that arbitrage strategies under uncertainties can effectively secure expected profits, and robust strategies perform better in risk management across varying levels of conservativeness, especially under highly volatile market conditions. This work provides insights into storage arbitrage strategy selection for market participants with differing risk preferences, emphasizing the adaptability of efficient frontiers to the electricity market.</p>

            <h2>Implications of Zoning Ordinances for Rural Utility-Scale Solar Deployment and Power System Decarbonization in the Great Lakes Region</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Papa Yaw Owusu-Obeng, Sarah Banas Mills, Michael T. Craig</p>
            <p>Local zoning ordinances across the United States have the impact of restricting development of energy infrastructure, including utility-scale solar photovoltaics. While these ordinances may be developed for legitimate purposes to protect public health and safety, they could impede or increase costs of power sector decarbonization. We quantify the role of utility-scale solar zoning ordinances on power sector decarbonization across the Great Lakes region (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) by integrating 6,300 rural community zoning ordinances into a power system planning model. Relative to no ordinances, solar zoning ordinances reduce total potential deployment of solar PV by 52% (or 1.6 TW) across our region. Currently, however, the biggest zoning barrier to deployment is zoning ordinances which are silent on utility-scale solar. Deployment restrictions translate to up to 4 GW greater investment needs and 5.6% greater PV investment costs to achieve a 10% PV generation target. Starker shifts occur at the state level, e.g. Wisconsin sees a 40% reduction in PV investments due to zoning restrictions. Our results underscore the need for planning that aligns local zoning laws with state and regional goals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Xi Zhang, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) has sparked interest in promoting their participation in the power market. Here we consider a setting in which different virtual power plants (VPPs) with certain flexible resources take part in electricity trading, either by direct participation in the wholesale power market, or interfaced by the Distribution System Operator (DSO). Our goal is to examine the role and influence of the DSO as a stakeholder, for which we formulate a Stackelberg game via a bilevel optimization model: the DSO maximizes profits at the upper level, while VPPs minimize operating costs at the lower level. To solve this problem, we use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucke optimality conditions of the convex lower-level problems to achieve a single-level mixed-integer nonlinear program. The results show that the role of the DSO as an intermediary agent leads to a decrease in operating costs for the VPPs, while guaranteeing a profit for the DSO.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Power Losses and the Efficacy of Power Minimization Strategies in Multichannel Electrical Stimulation Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesc Varkevisser, Wouter A. Serdijn, Tiago L. Costa</p>
            <p>Neuroprosthetic devices require multichannel stimulator systems with an increasing number of channels. However, there are inherent power losses in typical multichannel stimulation circuits caused by a mismatch between the power supply voltage and the voltage required at each electrode to successfully stimulate tissue. This imposes a bottleneck towards high-channel-count devices, which is particularly severe in wirelessly-powered devices. Hence, advances in the power efficiency of stimulation systems are critical. To support these advances, this paper presents a methodology to identify and quantify power losses associated with different power supply scaling strategies in multichannel stimulation systems. The proposed methodology utilizes distributions of stimulation amplitudes and electrode impedances to calculate power losses in multichannel systems. Experimental data from previously published studies spanning various stimulation applications were analyzed to evaluate the performance of fixed, global, and stepped supply scaling methods, focusing on their impact on power dissipation and efficiency. Variability in output conditions results in low power efficiency in multichannel stimulation systems across all applications. Stepped voltage scaling demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements, achieving an increase of 67 % to 146 %, particularly in high-channel-count applications with significant variability in tissue impedance. Global scaling, by contrast, was more advantageous for systems with fewer channels. The findings highlight the importance of tailoring power management strategies to specific applications to optimize efficiency while minimizing system complexity. The proposed methodology offers a framework for evaluating efficiency-complexity trade-offs, advancing the design of scalable neurostimulation systems.</p>

            <h2>Regression Equilibrium in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Dvorkin</p>
            <p>In two-stage electricity markets, renewable power producers enter the day-ahead market with a forecast of future power generation and then reconcile any forecast deviation in the real-time market at a penalty. The choice of the forecast model is thus an important strategy decision for renewable power producers as it affects financial performance. In electricity markets with large shares of renewable generation, the choice of the forecast model impacts not only individual performance but also outcomes for other producers. In this paper, we argue for the existence of a competitive regression equilibrium in two-stage electricity markets in terms of the parameters of private forecast models informing the participation strategies of renewable power producers. In our model, renewables optimize the forecast against the day-ahead and real-time prices, thereby maximizing the average profits across the day-ahead and real-time markets. By doing so, they also implicitly enhance the temporal cost coordination of day-ahead and real-time markets. We base the equilibrium analysis on the theory of variational inequalities, providing results on the existence and uniqueness of regression equilibrium in energy-only markets. We also devise two methods to compute regression equilibrium: centralized optimization and a decentralized ADMM-based algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kelsey Nelson, Javad Mohammadi</p>
            <p>As extreme weather events become more common and threaten power grids, the continuing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces a growing opportunity for their use as a distributed energy storage resource. This energy storage can be used as backup generation through the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, where electricity is sent back from EV batteries to the grid. With enough participation from EV owners, V2G can mitigate outages during grid emergencies. In order to investigate a practical application of V2G, this study leverages a vast array of real-world data, such as survey results on V2G participation willingness, historical outage data within ERCOT, current EV registrations, and demographic data. This data informs realistic emergency grid scenarios with V2G support using a synthetic transmission grid for Travis County. The results find that as EV ownership rises in the coming years, the simultaneous facilitation of bidirectional charging availability would allow for V2G to play a substantial role in preventing involuntary load shed as a result of emergencies like winter storms.</p>

            <h2>Promoting Shared Energy Storage Aggregation among High Price-Tolerance Prosumer: An Incentive Deposit and Withdrawal Service</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Lu, Jing Qiu, Cuo Zhang, Gang Lei, Jianguo Zhu</p>
            <p>Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household electricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the household electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for saving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy Storage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage in SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take additional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices, which happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not possess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to participate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does not require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain existing energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation of SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction step during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the energy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal services (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more electricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a matching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption behaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients in DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the matching mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqin Zhang, Meiling Chen, Zhengjie Zhang</p>
            <p>Whether during the early days of popularization or in the present, the window setting in Computed Tomography (CT) has always been an indispensable part of the CT analysis process. Although research has investigated the capabilities of CT multi-window fusion in enhancing neural networks, there remains a paucity of domain-invariant, intuitively interpretable methodologies for Auto Window Setting. In this work, we propose an plug-and-play module originate from Tanh activation function, which is compatible with mainstream deep learning architectures. Starting from the physical principles of CT, we adhere to the principle of interpretability to ensure the module's reliability for medical implementations. The domain-invariant design facilitates observation of the preference decisions rendered by the adaptive mechanism from a clinically intuitive perspective. This enables the proposed method to be understood not only by experts in neural networks but also garners higher trust from clinicians. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in multiple open-source datasets, yielding 10%~200% Dice improvements on hard segment targets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arash Baharvandi, Duong Tung Nguyen</p>
            <p>This paper presents a coordinated framework to optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging considering grid constraints and system uncertainties. The proposed framework consists of two optimization models. In particular, the distribution system operator (DSO) solves the first model to optimize the amount of deliverable energy flexibility that can be obtained from EV aggregators. To address the uncertainties of loads and solar energy generation, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is employed, enabling the transformation of uncertainty-related constraints into a set of equivalent deterministic constraints. Once the DSO has computed the optimal energy flexibility, each aggregator utilizes the second optimization model to optimize the charging schedule for its respective fleet of EVs. Numerical simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution network to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Phase Allocation in Unbalanced Power Distribution Networks using a Linearized DistFlow Formulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced but are designed to keep unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards. However, rapid integration of unbalanced devices, such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants, can exacerbate these imbalances. This increase can trigger protection devices, increase losses, and potentially damage devices. To address this issue, phase swapping (or phase allocation) has been proposed. Existing approaches predominantly rely on heuristic methods. In this work, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach for phase allocation. Our approach uses linearized DistFlow equations to represent the distribution network and incorporates a phase consistency constraint, enforced with binary variables, to ensure that downstream phase configurations align with upstream configurations. We validate the proposed approach on multiple benchmark test cases and demonstrate that it effectively improves network balance, as quantified by various metrics.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetry of Frequency Distribution in Power Systems: Sources, Estimation, Impact and Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taulant Kerci, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper analyses an emerging real-world phenomena in inverter-based renewable-dominated power systems, namely, asymmetry of frequency distribution. The paper first provides a rationale on why asymmetry reduces the "quality" of the frequency control and system operation. Then it provides qualitative theoretical insights that explain asymmetry in terms of the nonlinearity of real-world power systems and associated models. In particular network losses and pitch angle-based frequency control of wind power plants are discussed. Then the paper proposes a nonlinear compensation control to reduce the asymmetry as well as a statistical metric based on the frequency probability distribution to quantify the level of asymmetry in a power system. Real-world data obtained from the Irish and Australian transmission systems serve to support the theoretical appraisal, whereas simulations based on an IEEE benchmark system show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear compensation. The case study also shows that, while automatic generation control reduces asymmetry, frequency control limits and droop-based frequency support provided by wind generation using a tight deadband of 15 mHz, namely active power control, leads to a significant increase in the asymmetry of the frequency probability distribution.</p>

            <p>Sound Event Detection (SED) is challenging in noisy environments where overlapping sounds obscure target events. Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) aims to isolate the target sound events from a noisy clip. However, this approach can fail when the exact target sound is unknown, particularly in noisy test sets, leading to reduced performance. To address this issue, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize acoustic data. By using LLMs to identify and select specific noise types, we implement a noise augmentation method for noise-robust fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model is applied to predict clip-wise event predictions as text queries for the LASS model. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves SED performance in noisy environments. This work represents an early application of LLMs in noise-robust SED and suggests a promising direction for handling overlapping events in SED.

            <p>Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss, particularly in India, where access to retina specialists is limited in rural areas. This study aims to evaluate the Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetic Retinopathy Screening System (AIDRSS) for DR detection and prevalence assessment, addressing the growing need for scalable, automated screening solutions in resource-limited settings. Approach: A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata, India, involving 5,029 participants and 10,058 macula-centric retinal fundus images. The AIDRSS employed a deep learning algorithm with 50 million trainable parameters, integrated with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) preprocessing for enhanced image quality. DR was graded using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Scale, categorizing disease into five stages (DR0 to DR4). Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence rates were evaluated against expert retina specialist assessments. Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population was 13.7%, rising to 38.2% among individuals with elevated random blood glucose levels. The AIDRSS achieved an overall sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 88%, and 100% sensitivity for detecting referable DR (DR3 and DR4). These results demonstrate the system's robust performance in accurately identifying and grading DR in a diverse population. Conclusions: AIDRSS provides a reliable, scalable solution for early DR detection in resource-constrained environments. Its integration of advanced AI techniques ensures high diagnostic accuracy, with potential to significantly reduce the burden of diabetes-related vision loss in underserved regions.</p>

            <p>The emergence of generative AI and controllable diffusion has made image-to-image synthesis increasingly practical and efficient. However, when input images exhibit low entropy and sparse, the inherent characteristics of diffusion models often result in limited diversity. This constraint significantly interferes with data augmentation. To address this, we propose Diffusion Prism, a training-free framework that efficiently transforms binary masks into realistic and diverse samples while preserving morphological features. We explored that a small amount of artificial noise will significantly assist the image-denoising process. To prove this novel mask-to-image concept, we use nano-dendritic patterns as an example to demonstrate the merit of our method compared to existing controllable diffusion models. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to other biological patterns, highlighting its potential applications across various fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang</p>
            <p>Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture recently proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where many satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimation and conjugate beamforming. Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in both fading and non-fading scenarios, with significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, number of UTs, number of SAPs, orbital altitude, and service range brought by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT bring higher coverage probability despite existing multi-user interference. Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, which provides valuable system design insights.</p>

Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous-signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the coverage probabilities of UTs under different channel conditions. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and the benefit of NOMA only exists when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35\%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</p>

            <h2>Resiliency metrics quantifying emergency response in a distribution system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shikhar Pandey, Gowtham Kandaperumal, Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson</p>
            <p>The electric distribution system is a cornerstone of modern life, playing a critical role in the daily activities and well-being of individuals. As the world transitions toward a decarbonized future, where even mobility relies on electricity, ensuring the resilience of the grid becomes paramount. This paper introduces novel resilience metrics designed to equip utilities and stakeholders with actionable tools to assess performance during storm events. The metrics focus on emergency storm response and the resources required to improve customer service. The practical calculation of the metrics from historical utility data is demonstrated for multiple storm events. Additionally, the metrics' improvement with added crews is estimated by "rerunning history" with faster restoration. By applying this resilience framework, utilities can enhance their restoration strategies and unlock potential cost savings, benefiting both providers and customers in an era of heightened energy dependency.</p>

            <h2>Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Bhatt, Siddharth Penumatsa, Nirbhay Singhal</p>
            <p>The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Quantum Power Flow for Risk Assessment in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brynjar Sævarsson, Hjörtur Jóhannsson, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the first quantum computing framework for Stochastic Quantum Power Flow (SQPF) analysis in power systems. The proposed method leverages quantum states to encode power flow distributions, enabling the use of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling to efficiently assess the probability of line overloads. Our approach significantly reduces the required sample size compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, making it particularly suited for risk assessments in scenarios involving high uncertainty, such as renewable energy integration. We validate the method on two test systems, demonstrating the computational advantage of quantum algorithms in reducing sample complexity while maintaining accuracy. This work represents a foundational step toward scalable quantum power flow analysis, with potential applications in future power system operations and planning. The results show promising computational speedups, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in addressing the increasing uncertainty in modern power grids.</p>

            <h2>A Deep Learning-Based Method for Power System Resilience Evaluation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuesong Wang, Caisheng Wang</p>
            <p>Power systems are critical infrastructure in modern society, and power outages can cause significant disruptions to communities and individuals' daily lives. The resilience of a power system measures its ability to maintain power supply during highly disruptive events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and thunderstorms. Traditional methods for quantifying power system resilience include statistics-based and simulation-based approaches. Statistics-based methods offer a retrospective analysis of system performance without requiring a physical model, while simulation-based methods necessitate detailed physical system information and often simplify real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a deep learning-based method for evaluating power system resilience using historical power outage data. The method leverages the generalization capabilities of deep learning models and incorporates socio-economic and demographic factors as weighting terms to highlight the impacts on vulnerable demographic groups. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two case studies: one with real historical outage data and the other with simulated outage records. This approach provides valuable insights into measuring power system resilience against hazardous weather events without requiring a physical model of the target systems. The evaluation results can further guide the planning of distributed energy resources for resilience enhancement.</p>

            <h2>DRL-Based Medium-Term Planning of Renewable-Integrated Self-Scheduling Cascaded Hydropower to Guide Wholesale Market Participation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianbang Chen, Yikui Liu, Neng Fan, Lei Wu</p>
            <p>For self-scheduling cascaded hydropower (S-CHP) facilities, medium-term planning is a critical step that coordinates water availability over the medium-term horizon, providing water usage guidance for their short-term operations in wholesale market participation. Typically, medium-term planning strategies (e.g., reservoir storage targets at the end of each short-term period) are determined by either optimization methods or rules of thumb. However, with the integration of variable renewable energy sources (VRESs), optimization-based methods suffer from deviations between the anticipated and actual reservoir storage, while rules of thumb could be financially conservative, thereby compromising short-term operating profitability in wholesale market participation. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework to derive medium-term planning policies for VRES-integrated S-CHPs (VS-CHPs), which can leverage contextual information underneath individual short-term periods and train planning policies by their induced short-term operating profits in wholesale market participation. The proposed DRL-based framework offers two practical merits. First, its planning strategies consider both seasonal requirements of reservoir storage and needs for short-term operating profits. Second, it adopts a multi-parametric programming-based strategy to accelerate the expensive training process associated with multi-step short-term operations. Finally, the DRL-based framework is evaluated on a real-world VS-CHP, demonstrating its advantages over current practice.</p>

            <h2>Promoting Shared Energy Storage Aggregation among High Price-Tolerance Prosumer: An Incentive Deposit and Withdrawal Service</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Lu, Jing Qiu, Cuo Zhang, Gang Lei, Jianguo Zhu</p>
            <p>Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household electricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the household electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for saving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy Storage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage in SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take additional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices, which happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not possess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to participate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does not require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain existing energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation of SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction step during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the energy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal services (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more electricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a matching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption behaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients in DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the matching mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Buxin She, Hisham Mahmood, Marcelo Elizondo, Veronica Adetola, Yuqing Dong</p>
            <p>As offshore wind farms (OWFs) become increasingly prevalent in Northern California and Southern Oregon, they introduce faster dynamics into the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system, reshaping its dynamic behavior. Accordingly, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential to assess high frequency dynamics of the WECC system with integrated OWFs. Against this background, this paper presents the integration of detailed dynamic models of OWFs into a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD software. The sequential initialization technique is employed to facilitate the smooth initiation of a large-scale system in an EMT simulation. The performance of the configured model is assessed under wind speed variations and grounded faults, demonstrating the effectiveness of the miniWECC system with OWFs. This system serves as a valuable basic use case for validating the fast dynamic performance of future WECC systems with high penetration of wind energy.</p>

            <h2>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liudong Chen, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasiconcave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasiconcave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers' flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adel Heidari, Agrim Gupta, Ish Kumar Jain, Dinesh Bharadia</p>
            <p>The rapid proliferation of devices and increasing data traffic in cellular networks necessitate advanced solutions to meet these escalating demands. Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology offers a promising approach, significantly enhancing throughput, coverage, and spatial multi-plexing. Despite its advantages, massive MIMO systems often lack flexible software controls over hardware, limiting their ability to optimize operational expenditure (OpEx) by reducing power consumption while maintaining performance. Current software-controlled methods, such as antenna muting combined with digital beamforming and hybrid beamforming, have notable limitations. Antenna muting struggles to maintain throughput and coverage, while hybrid beamforming faces hardware constraints that restrict scalability and future-proofing. This work presents PhaseMO, a versatile approach that adapts to varying network loads. PhaseMO effectively reduces power consumption in low-load scenarios without sacrificing coverage and overcomes the hardware limitations of hybrid beamforming, offering a scalable and future-proof solution. We will show that PhaseMO can achieve up to 30% improvement in energy efficiency while avoiding about 10% coverage reduction and 5dB increase in UE transmit power.</p>

            <h2>New Linear Model of a Composite Energy Storage System with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mazen Elsaadany, Mads R. Almassalkhi, Simon H. Tindemans</p>
            <p>To optimize battery dispatch, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory and ensure dispatch is admissible (i.e., does not lead to unexpected SOC saturation). But battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we consider a composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while ensuring admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</p>

            <p>Purpose: The computation methods for modeling, controlling and optimizing the transforming grid are evolving rapidly. We review and systemize knowledge for a special class of computation methods that solve large-scale power grid optimization problems. Summary: Large-scale grid optimizations are pertinent for, amongst other things, hedging against risk due to resource stochasticity, evaluating aggregated DERs' impact on grid operation and design, and improving the overall efficiency of grid operation in terms of cost, reliability, and carbon footprint. We attribute the continual growth in scale and complexity of grid optimizations to a large influx of new spatial and temporal features in both transmission (T) and distribution (D) networks. Therefore, to systemize knowledge in the field, we discuss the recent advancements in T and D systems from the viewpoint of mechanistic physics-based and emerging data-driven methods. Findings: We find that while mechanistic physics-based methods are leading the science in solving large-scale grid optimizations, data-driven techniques, especially physics-constrained ones, are emerging as an alternative to solve otherwise intractable problems. We also find observable gaps in the field and ascertain these gaps from the paper's literature review and by collecting and synthesizing feedback from industry experts.</p>

            <h2>A capacity renting framework for shared energy storage considering peer-to-peer energy trading of prosumers with privacy protection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingcong Sun, Laijun Chen, Yue Chen, Mingrui Tang, Shengwei Mei</p>
            <p>Shared energy storage systems (ESS) present a promising solution to the temporal imbalance between energy generation from renewable distributed generators (DGs) and the power demands of prosumers. However, as DG penetration rates rise, spatial energy imbalances become increasingly significant, necessitating the integration of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within the shared ESS framework. Two key challenges emerge in this context: the absence of effective mechanisms and the greater difficulty for privacy protection due to increased data communication. This research proposes a capacity renting framework for shared ESS considering P2P energy trading of prosumers. In the proposed framework, prosumers can participate in P2P energy trading and rent capacities from shared ESS. A generalized Nash game is formulated to model the trading process and the competitive interactions among prosumers, and the variational equilibrium of the game is proved to be equivalent to the optimal solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem. To address the privacy protection concern, the problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the Paillier cryptosystem. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the impact of P2P energy trading on the shared ESS framework and validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm.</p>

            <p>In the classical control of network systems, the control actions on a node are determined as a function of the states of all nodes in the network. Motivated by applications where the global state cannot be reconstructed in real time due to limitations in the collection, communication, and processing of data, here we introduce a control approach in which the control actions can be computed as a function of the states of the nodes within a limited state information neighborhood. The trade-off between the control performance and the size of this neighborhood is primarily determined by the condition number of the controllability Gramian. Our theoretical results are supported by simulations on regular and random networks and are further illustrated by an application to the control of power-grid synchronization. We demonstrate that for well-conditioned Gramians, there is no significant loss of control performance as the size of the state information neighborhood is reduced, allowing efficient control of large networks using only local information.</p>

            <p>In power system steady-state estimation (PSSE), one needs to consider (1) the need for robust statistics, (2) the nonconvex transmission constraints, (3) the fast-varying nature of the inputs, and the corresponding need to track optimal trajectories as closely as possible. In combination, these challenges have not been considered, yet. In this paper, we address all three challenges. The need for robustness (1) is addressed by using an approach based on the so-called Huber model. The non-convexity (2) of the problem, which results in first order methods failing to find global minima, is dealt with by applying global methods. One of these methods is based on a mixed integer quadratic formulation, which provides results of several orders of magnitude better than conventional gradient descent. Lastly, the trajectory tracking (3) is discussed by showing under which conditions the trajectory tracking of the SDP relaxations has meaning.</p>

            <p>Modern network systems, such as transportation and communication systems, are prone to cyber-physical disruptions and thus suffer efficiency loss. This paper studies network resiliency, in terms of throughput, and develops resilient control to improve throughput. We consider single-commodity networks that admit congestion propagation. We also apply a Markov process to model disruption switches. For throughput analysis, we first use insights into congestion spillback to propose novel Lyapunov functions and then exploit monotone network dynamics to reduce computational costs of verifying stability conditions. For control design, we show that (i) for a network with infinite link storage space, there exists an open-loop control that attains the min-expected-cut capacity; (ii) for a network with observable disruptions that restrict maximum sending and/or receiving flows, there exists a mode-dependent control that attains the expected-min-cut capacity; (iii) for general networks, there exists a closed-loop control with throughput guarantees. We also derive lower bounds of resiliency scores for a set of numerical examples and verify resiliency improvement with our method.</p>

            <p>In what ways could cellular massive MIMO be improved? This technology has already been shown to bring huge performance gains. However, coverage holes and difficulties to transmit multiple streams to multi-antenna users because of insufficient channel rank remain issues. Distributed MIMO, also known as cell-free massive MIMO, might be the ultimate solution. However, while being a powerful technology, it is expensive to install backhaul, and it is a difficult problem to achieve accurate phase alignment for coherent multi-user beamforming on downlink. Another option is reflective intelligent surfaces - but they have large form factors and require a lot of training and control overhead, and probably, in practice, some form of active filtering to make them sufficiently band-selective. We propose a new approach to densification of cellular systems, envisioning repeater-assisted cellular massive MIMO, where a large numbers of physically small and cheap wireless repeaters are deployed. They receive and retransmit signals instantaneously, appearing as active scatterers. Meaning that they appear as ordinary channel scatterers but with amplification. We elaborate on the requirements of such repeaters, show that the performance of these systems could potentially approach that of distributed MIMO, and outline future research directions.</p>

Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times.

            <p>Designing multi-agent systems with safety constraints and uncertain dynamics is a challenging problem. This paper studies a stochastic dynamic non-cooperative game with coupling safety chance constraints. The uncertainty is assumed to satisfy a concentration of measure property. Firstly, due to the non-convexity of chance constraints, a convex under-approximation of chance constraints is given using constraints on the expectation. Then, the conditions for the existence of the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) of the under-approximated game are investigated, and the relation between the $\varepsilon-$SGNE of the original game and the under-approximated one is derived. A sampling-based algorithm is proposed for the SGNE seeking of the under-approximated game that does not require knowing the distribution of the uncertainty nor the analytical computation of expectations. Finally, under some assumptions on the game's pseudo-gradient mapping, the almost sure convergence of the algorithm to SGNE is proven. A numerical study is carried out on demand-side management in microgrids with shared battery to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <p>To facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the wholesale market while maintaining the tractability of associated market operation tools such as unit commitment (UC), existing DER aggregation (DERA) studies usually consider that each DERA is presented on a single node of the transmission network. Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical distribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission nodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs (M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows is a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to DERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the distribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in industry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC (CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs, treated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against aggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are modeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging historical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space. With this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which is reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders decomposition. The proposed method is tested on an IEEE 24-bus system to illustrate its effectiveness in managing M-DERA integration while ensuring operational economics and mitigating the overloading of transmission lines.</p>

            <h2>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liudong Chen, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasi-concave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasi-concave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</p>

            <h2>AC-aware Optimization Framework for Under-Frequency Load Shedding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mazen Elsaadany, Muhammad Hamza Ali, Amritanshu Pandey, Mads R.Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) prevents system collapse during large disturbances. Increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and reduced system inertia makes it challenging to design a static UFLS scheme, which relies on preset frequency thresholds and load shed fractions to meet design criteria across all possible operating conditions. Due to non-linearity and traceability issues, previous adaptive UFLS schemes use simplified tractable frequency models that overlook AC network effects such as voltage-dependent load/generation. This paper leverages model order reduction techniques to obtain a higher fidelity low-order model of system frequency dynamics that captures AC network effects while incorporating turbine governor action and their associated limits. The model is then used in a new AC-aware predictive optimization framework to adapt UFLS setpoints periodically based on current operating conditions while minimizing load shed. Validated on a 1,648-bus system with PSS/E simulations, the proposed method meets design criteria under various operating conditions and disturbance scenarios. Furthermore, the framework outperforms conventional static UFLS schemes and adaptive UFLS schemes based on simplified dynamic models.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Robust Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection Through Self-Supervised Pretraining</h2>

            <p>Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) is the task of detecting the presence of speech from a known target-speaker in an audio frame. Recently, deep neural network-based models have shown good performance in this task. However, training these models requires extensive labelled data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, particularly if generalization to unseen environments is crucial. To mitigate this, we propose a causal, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pretraining framework, called Denoising Autoregressive Predictive Coding (DN-APC), to enhance TS-VAD performance in noisy conditions. We also explore various speaker conditioning methods and evaluate their performance under different noisy conditions. Our experiments show that DN-APC improves performance in noisy conditions, with a general improvement of approx. 2% in both seen and unseen noise. Additionally, we find that FiLM conditioning provides the best overall performance. Representation analysis via tSNE plots reveals robust initial representations of speech and non-speech from pretraining. This underscores the effectiveness of SSL pretraining in improving the robustness and performance of TS-VAD models in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>RadHop-Net: A Lightweight Radiomics-to-Error Regression for False Positive Reduction In MRI Prostate Cancer Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasileios Magoulianitis, Jiaxin Yang, Catherine A. Alexander, C.-C. Jay Kuo</p>
            <p>Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is a leading cause of cancer death in men, yet it has a high survival rate if diagnosed early. Bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI) reading has become a prominent screening test for csPCa. However, this process has a high false positive (FP) rate, incurring higher diagnostic costs and patient discomfort. This paper introduces RadHop-Net, a novel and lightweight CNN for FP reduction. The pipeline consists of two stages: Stage 1 employs data driven radiomics to extract candidate ROIs. In contrast, Stage 2 expands the receptive field about each ROI using RadHop-Net to compensate for the predicted error from Stage 1. Moreover, a novel loss function for regression problems is introduced to balance the influence between FPs and true positives (TPs). RadHop-Net is trained in a radiomics-to-error manner, thus decoupling from the common voxel-to-label approach. The proposed Stage 2 improves the average precision (AP) in lesion detection from 0.407 to 0.468 in the publicly available pi-cai dataset, also maintaining a significantly smaller model size than the state-of-the-art.</p>

            <h2>UDMC: Unified Decision-Making and Control Framework for Urban Autonomous Driving with Motion Prediction of Traffic Participants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haichao Liu, Kai Chen, Yulin Li, Zhenmin Huang, Ming Liu, Jun Ma</p>
            <p>Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making and motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance, especially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP), considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency, robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared against various baseline models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanzan Sun, Jiacheng Qiu, Guangjin Pan, Shugong Xu, Shunqing Zhang, Xiaoyun Wang, Shuangfeng Han</p>
            <p>Extended reality (XR), blending virtual and real worlds, is a key application of future networks. While AI advancements enhance XR capabilities, they also impose significant computational and energy challenges on lightweight XR devices. In this paper, we developed a distributed queue model for multi-task DNN inference, addressing issues of resource competition and queue coupling. In response to the challenges posed by the high energy consumption and limited resources of XR devices, we designed a dual time-scale joint optimization strategy for model partitioning and resource allocation, formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. This strategy aims to minimize the total energy consumption of XR devices while ensuring queue stability and adhering to computational and communication resource constraints. To tackle this problem, we devised a Lyapunov-guided Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, named LyaPPO. Numerical results demonstrate that the LyaPPO algorithm outperforms the baselines, achieving energy conservation of 24.79% to 46.14% under varying resource capacities. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption of XR devices by 24.29% to 56.62% compared to baseline algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Markov Decision Processes for Satellite Maneuver Planning and Collision Avoidance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Kuhl, Jun Wang, Duncan Eddy, Mykel Kochenderfer</p>
            <p>This paper presents a decentralized, online planning approach for scalable maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning, such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge, thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based collision avoidance techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bodong Shang, Xiangyu Li, Zheng Wang, Junchao Ma</p>
            <p>Space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has been envisioned as a competitive solution for large scale and wide coverage of future wireless networks. By integrating both the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and the terrestrial network (TN), SGIN can provide high speed and omnipresent wireless network access for the users using the predefined licensed spectrums. Considering the scarcity of the spectrum resource and the low spectrum efficiency of the SGIN, we enable the NTN and TN to share the spectrum to improve overall system performance, i.e., weighted-sum area data rate (WS-ADR). However, mutual interference between NTN and TN is often inevitable and thus causes SGIN performance degradation. In this work, we consider a ground protection zone for the TN base stations, in which the NTN users are only allowed to use the NTN reserved spectrum to mitigate the NTN and TN mutual interference. We analytically derive the coverage probability and area data rate (ADR) of the typical users and study the performance under various protection zone sizes and spectrum allocation parameter settings. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the WS-ADR could be maximized by selecting the appropriate radius of protection zone and bandwidth allocation factor in the SGIN.</p>

            <p>With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance, particularly in intricate and dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The first stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.</p>

            <p>A significant challenge for computation offloading in wireless multi-hop networks is the complex interaction among traffic flows in the presence of interference. Existing approaches often ignore these key effects and/or rely on outdated queueing and channel state information. To fill these gaps, we reformulate joint offloading and routing as a routing problem on an extended graph with physical and virtual links. We adopt the state-of-the-art shortest path-biased Backpressure routing algorithm, which allows the destination and the route of a job to be dynamically adjusted at every time step based on network-wide long-term information and real-time states of local neighborhoods. In large networks, our approach achieves smaller makespan than existing approaches, such as separated Backpressure offloading and joint offloading and routing based on linear programming.</p>

            <p>This paper studies energy-efficient hybrid beamforming architectures and its algorithm design in millimeter-wave communication systems, aiming to address the challenges faced by existing hybrid beamforming due to low hardware flexibility and high power consumption. To solve the problems of existing hybrid beamforming, a novel energy-efficient hybrid beamforming architecture is proposed, where radio-frequency (RF) switch networks are introduced at the front and rear ends of the phase shifter network, enabling dynamic connections between the RF chains and the phase shifter array as well as the antenna array. The system model of the proposed architecture is established, including digital precoding and analog precoding processes, and the practical hardware limitations such as quantization errors of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and phase shifter resolution. In order to maximize the energy efficiency, this paper derives an energy efficiency model including spectral efficiency and system power consumption, and a hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed based on block coordinate descent to iteratively optimize the digital precoding matrix, analog precoding matrix, and DAC resolution. Simulation results under the NYUSIM-generated millimeter-wave channels show that the proposed hybrid beamforming architecture and precoding algorithm have higher energy efficiency than existing representative architectures and precoding algorithms under complete and partial channel state information, while the loss of spectral efficiency compared to fully connected architecture is less than 20%</p>

            <p>The Northwestern University Freight Rail Infrastructure and Energy Network Decarbonization (NUFRIEND) framework is a comprehensive industry-oriented tool for simulating the deployment of new energy technologies including biofuels, e-fuels, battery-electric, and hydrogen locomotives. By classifying fuel types into two categories based on deployment requirements, the associated optimal charging/fueling facility location and sizing problem are solved with a five-step framework. Life cycle analyses (LCA) and techno-economic analyses (TEA) are used to estimate carbon reduction, capital investments, cost of carbon reduction, and operational impacts, enabling sensitivity analysis with operational and technological parameters. The framework is illustrated on lower-carbon drop-in fuels as well as battery-electric technology deployments for US Eastern and Western Class I railroad networks. Drop-in fuel deployments are modeled as admixtures with diesel in existing locomotives, while battery-electric deployments are shown for varying technology penetration levels and locomotive ranges. When mixed in a 50 percent ratio with diesel, results show biodiesel's capacity to reduce emissions at 36 percent with a cost of 0.13 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, while e-fuels offer a 50 percent emissions reduction potential at a cost of 0.22 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced. Battery-electric results for 50 percent deployment over all ton-miles highlight the value of future innovations in battery energy densities as scenarios assuming 800-mile range locomotives show an estimated emissions reduction of 46 percent with a cost of 0.06 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, compared to 16 percent emissions reduction at a cost of 0.11 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced for 400-mile range locomotives.</p>

            <p>This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs (equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas (equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget. Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is explicitly incorporated into the design objective.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel control for Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) based on the Complex Frequency (CF) concept. The controller's objective is to maintain a constant CF of the voltage at the terminals of the IBR by adjusting its current reference. This current is imposed based on the well-known power flow equation, the dynamics of which are calculated through the estimation of the CF of the voltages of the adjacent buses. Performance is evaluated by analyzing local variations in frequency and magnitude of the voltage, as well as the response of the system's Center of Inertia (CoI) frequency, and then compared with conventional frequency droop, PI voltage controllers and virtual inertia. The case study utilizes the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus model of the Irish transmission grid and considers various contingencies and sensitivities such as the impact of limiters, delays, noise, R/X ratio, and EMT dynamics. Results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the conventional controllers, leading to significant improvements in the overall dynamic response of the system.</p>

            <p>High-accuracy positioning has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices.

In this study, we address this challenge by reformulating the problem of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation into image reconstruction of spatial spectrum. To this end, we design a model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN), which can automatically calibrate the angular-dependent phase error. The proposed MoD-DNN approach employs an iterative optimization scheme between a convolutional neural network and a sparse conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectrum calibration and AoA estimation.</p>

            <p>As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.</p>

            <p>The battery performance and lifespan of electric vehicles (EVs) degrade significantly in cold climates, requiring a considerable amount of energy to heat up the EV batteries. This paper proposes a novel technology, namely temperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power and reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead of fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics and inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of energy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging model is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as battery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV charging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle rescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed temperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility value of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The proposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost and a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.</p>

            <h2>Electricity Market-Clearing With Extreme Events</h2>

            <p>Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this gap in both research and practice, we propose managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through an additional reserve service, termed extreme reserve. The procurement of extreme reserve is co-optimized with energy and regular reserve using a large deviation theory chance-constrained (LDT-CC) model, where LDT offers a mathematical framework to quantify the increased uncertainty during extreme events. To mitigate the high additional costs associated with reserve scheduling under the LDT-CC model, we also propose an LDT model based on weighted chance constraints (LDT-WCC). This model prepares the power system for extreme events at a lower cost, making it a less conservative alternative to the LDT-CC model. The proposed market design leads to a competitive equilibrium while ensuring cost recovery. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system highlight the advantages of the proposed market design.</p>

            <h2>An Econometric Analysis of Large Flexible Cryptocurrency-mining Consumers in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Majumder, Ignacio Aravena, Le Xie</p>
            <p>In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that, surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not directly correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T&D) charges - commonly referred to as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges - during the summer months. As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the overall impact on the power grid. The developed model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Tang, Yiming Yu, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek</p>
            <p>LoRa provides long-range, energy-efficient communications in Internet of Things (IoT) applications that rely on Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) capabilities. Despite these merits, concerns persist regarding the security of LoRa networks, especially in situations where device identification and authentication are imperative to secure the reliable access to the LoRa networks. This paper explores a deep learning (DL) approach to tackle these concerns, focusing on two critical tasks, namely (i) identifying LoRa devices and (ii) classifying them to legitimate and rogue devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs), encompassing both convolutional and feedforward neural networks, are trained for these tasks using actual LoRa signal data. In this setting, the adversaries may spoof rogue LoRa signals through the kernel density estimation (KDE) method based on legitimate device signals that are received by the adversaries. Two cases are considered, (i) training two separate classifiers, one for each of the two tasks, and (ii) training a multi-task classifier for both tasks. The vulnerabilities of the resulting DNNs to manipulations in input samples are studied in form of untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Individual and common perturbations are considered against single-task and multi-task classifiers for the LoRa signal analysis. To provide resilience against such attacks, a defense approach is presented by increasing the robustness of classifiers with adversarial training. Results quantify how vulnerable LoRa signal classification tasks are to adversarial attacks and emphasize the need to fortify IoT applications against these subtle yet effective threats.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <h2>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</p>

To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanting Lyu, Songjie Yang, Yue Xiu, Zhongpei Zhang, Chadi Assi, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <p>Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at this https URL</p>

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <h2>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanting Lyu, Songjie Yang, Yue Xiu, Zhongpei Zhang, Chadi Assi, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng</p>
            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints.

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association.

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <h2>Online Low-Carbon Workload, Energy, and Temperature Management of Distributed Data Centers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng</p>
            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative ISAC-empowered Low-Altitude Economy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Tang, Yiming Yu, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <h2>Movable Antennas Enabled ISAC Systems: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhendong Li, Jianle Ba, Zhou Su, Jinyuan Huang, Haixia Peng, Wen Chen, Linkang Du, Tom H. Luan</p>
            <p>The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything. Meanwhile, MA utilizes the spatial variations of wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the positions of MA elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve the channel and further enhance the performance of the ISAC systems. In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yida Wang, Guojie Hu, Xiaoling Hu, Xingbo Lu, Yuzhen Huang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p>We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains.

            <h2>RUL forecasting for wind turbine predictive maintenance based on deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syed Shazaib Shah, Tan Daoliang, Sah Chandan Kumar</p>
            <p>Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm operation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of wind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to provide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning, limiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric attention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby minimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are proposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</p>

            <p>Concerns about the environmental footprint of machine learning are increasing. While studies of energy use and emissions of ML models are a growing subfield, most ML researchers and developers still do not incorporate energy measurement as part of their work practices. While measuring energy is a crucial step towards reducing carbon footprint, it is also not straightforward. This paper introduces the main considerations necessary for making sound use of energy measurement tools and interpreting energy estimates, including the use of at-the-wall versus on-device measurements, sampling strategies and best practices, common sources of error, and proxy measures. It also contains practical tips and real-world scenarios that illustrate how these considerations come into play. It concludes with a call to action for improving the state of the art of measurement methods and standards for facilitating robust comparisons between diverse hardware and software environments.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Power Smoothing Control for Wind Storage Integrated System with Physics-informed Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyi Wang, Huan Zhao, Yuji Cao, Zibin Pan, Guolong Liu, Gaoqi Liang, Junhua Zhao</p>
            <p>The Wind Storage Integrated System with Power Smoothing Control (PSC) has emerged as a promising solution to ensure both efficient and reliable wind energy generation. However, existing PSC strategies overlook the intricate interplay and distinct control frequencies between batteries and wind turbines, and lack consideration of wake effect and battery degradation cost. In this paper, a novel coordinated control framework with hierarchical levels is devised to address these challenges effectively, which integrates the wake model and battery degradation model. In addition, after reformulating the problem as a Markov decision process, the multi-agent reinforcement learning method is introduced to overcome the bi-level characteristic of the problem. Moreover, a Physics-informed Neural Network-assisted Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PAMA-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to incorporate the power fluctuation differential equation and expedite the learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulations conducted in four distinct scenarios using WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm facilitates approximately an 11% increase in total profit and a 19% decrease in power fluctuation compared to the traditional methods, thereby addressing the dual objectives of economic efficiency and grid-connected energy reliability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imran Pervez, Ricardo Pinto Lima, Omar Knio</p>
            <p>We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Chen, Yang Li, Jun Cai, Songlin Gu, Ying Yan</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel approach for tracking the dynamic trajectories of integrated natural gas and power systems, leveraging a Kalman filter-based structure. To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p>

            <h2>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Liu, Bo Sun, Danny H.K. Tsang</p>
            <p>With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</p>

            <h2>Robust Economic Dispatch with Flexible Demand and Adjustable Uncertainty Set</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Liu, Su Wang, Danny H.K. Tsang</p>
            <p>With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</p>
