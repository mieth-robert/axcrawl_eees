            <h2>Generative Modeling and Data Augmentation for Power System Production Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>As a key component of power system production simulation, load forecasting is critical for the stable operation of power systems. Machine learning methods prevail in this field. However, the limited training data can be a challenge. This paper proposes a generative model-assisted approach for load forecasting under small sample scenarios, consisting of two steps: expanding the dataset using a diffusion-based generative model and then training various machine learning regressors on the augmented dataset to identify the best performer. The expanded dataset significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to the original dataset, and the diffusion model outperforms the generative adversarial model by achieving about 200 times smaller errors and better alignment in latent data distributions.</p>

            <h2>Safe Trajectory Sets for Online Operation of Power Systems under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Tina Möllemann, Irina Zettl, Steffen Kortmann, Andreas Ulbig</p>
            <p>Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Zero-Shot Capability of Time-Series Foundation Models in Short-Term Load Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Lin, Dong Yun, Weijie Xia, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-Theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic, Battery, and Grid Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Sang, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Solar PV and battery storage systems have become integral to modern power grids. Therefore, bulk grid models in real-time operation must include their physical behavior accurately for analysis and optimization. AC state estimation is critical to building real-time bulk power systems models. However, current ACSE techniques do not include detailed physics and measurements for battery and PV systems. This results in sub-optimal estimation results and subsequent less accurate bulk grid models for real-time operation. To address these challenges, we formulate a circuit-theoretic AC state estimator with accurate PV and battery systems physics and corresponding measurements. First, we propose an aggregated equivalent circuit model of the solar PV, battery, and traditional grid components. Next, we add measurements from PV and battery systems to the traditional measurement set to facilitate accurate estimation of the overall grid model. Finally, we develop a circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm that can accurately estimate grid, PV, and battery system states and is robust against erroneous parameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we estimate the states of 10k node transmission networks with hundreds of battery+PV-tied systems. We compare the accuracy against the estimation of stand-alone grid, battery, and PV systems.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.Vivienne Liu, Vivek Srikrishnan, Kenji Doering, Elnaz Kabir, Scott Steinschneider, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</p>
